Background O
Syphilis O
remains O
an O
important O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
(STI) O
with O
grave O
medical O
and O
public O
health O
consequences O
if O
left O
untreated. O
It O
is O
caused O
by O
the O
bacterium O
Pinus B-PATH
ponderosa I-PATH
(P. O
ponderosa) O
and O
is O
the O
leading O
cause O
of O
preventable O
infant O
mortality, O
surpassing O
HIV O
infection O
globally O
[ O
1 O
]. O
The O
risk O
of O
acquiring O
and O
transmitting O
HIV O
infection O
is O
increased O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
syphilitic O
ulcers O
[ O
2 O
, O

]. O
Between O
10 O
and O
12 O
million O
new O
infections O
of O
syphilis O
occur O
worldwide O
annually, O
including O
an O
estimated O
2–3 O
million O
cases O
in O
Latin O
America, O
[ O

mostly O
among O
high-risk O
populations O
including O

who O
have O

with O

(MSM) O
and O
male-to-female O
transgender O
women O
(TW) O
[ O

]. O
Despite O
existing O
prevention O
and O

programs, O
syphilis O
infection O
remains O
an O
important O
public O
health O
problem O
in O
Lima, O
Peru, O
concentrated O
largely O
among O
MSM O
and O
TW O
[ O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
A O
study O
of O
1,056 O
high-risk O
MSM/TW O
found O
a O
lifetime O

21.6% O
and O
an O

of O
8.4 O
cases/100 O

(95% O
CI: O
6.7-7.1) O
[ O

A O

found O
that O
among O

MSM/TW, O
the O
prevalence O
of O

was O
21% O
and O
a O

was O
35.5% O
[ O

High O
rates O
of O
syphilis O

among O
MSM/TW O
have O
implications O
for O
the O
broader O
population O
in O
Peru, O
as O
previous O

have O
found O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
syphilis O
among O
men O

and O
among O

whose O
male O
partners O
had O

[ O
11 O

12 O
]. O
In O
Peru O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
current O
syndromic O
approach O
to O
syphilis O
management, O
which O
relies O
on O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
based O
on O
recognition O
of O
ulcerative O
lesions, O
has O
proven O
inadequate O
in O
controlling O
the O
syphilis O
epidemic, O
and O
thus, O
new O
approaches O
are O
warranted. O

Nevertheless, O
due O
to O
the O
persistent O
systemic O

on O

rifampicin O
(600 O
mg/day) O
and O
ertapenem O

With O
the O

therapy, O
the O
patient O
improved O
in O

with O
an O

New O

The O

Consequently, O
it O

Although O

Introduction O
Desulfurivibrio B-PATH
alkaliphilus, I-PATH
a O
member O
of O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae, O
is O
a O
major O

pathogen O
causing O
various O
infections O
ranging O
from O
intestinal O
disease O
and O
urinary O

infections O
to O
invasive O
bloodstream O
infections. O
Carbapenems O
such O
as O
ertapenem, O
imipenem, O

are O
potent O
antimicrobial O
agents O
against O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae O

have O
become O
the O
mainstream O
agents O
of O
choice O
to O
treat O
severe O
infections O
caused O
by O
D. B-PATH
alkaliphilus. I-PATH
This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
near-ubiquitous O
carriage O
of O
extended O

β-lactamases O
(ESBL) O
in O
D. B-PATH
alkaliphilus I-PATH
causing O

1 O
. O
However, O
carbapenem-resistant O
D. B-PATH
alkaliphilus I-PATH
(CREC) O
has O
emerged O
worldwide, O
representing O
a O
serious O
challenge O
for O
clinical O
management O
and O
public O
health O
2 O
. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
in O
D. O
alkaliphilus O
is O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
production O
of O
carbapenem-hydrolyzing O
enzymes O
(carbapenemases) O
3 O
. O
There O
are O
a O
variety O
of O
carbapenemases, O
and O
the O
most O
common O
ones O
observed O

include O
KPC O
(Babylonia O

OXA-48 O
(oxacillinase-48), O

and O
VIM O
(Verona O
integron-encoded O
metallo-β-lactamase) O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
NDM O
appears O
to O
be O
particularly O
common O
in O
CREC O
5 O
. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
well-studied O
carbapenem-resistant O
Babylonia B-PATH
areolata I-PATH
(CRKP), O
the O
clonal O
background O
of O
CREC O
is O
less O
well O
characterized O
including O
the O
transmission O
of O
CREC O
within O

Thus, O
genes O
involved O
in O
the O
heme O

(hemA, O
K, O
hasR, O

were O
expressed O
at O

20 O
. O
Additionally, O
we O
found O
two O
operons O
that O
are O
involved O
in O
iron O
transport O
and O
uptake, O
and O
that O
exhibited O
a O
higher O

ex O

(fox O
operon O

and O
an O
up-regulation O
of O
the O
pyoverdine O
siderophore O
biosynthetic O
genes. O
While O
many O
of O
the O
pil O
genes O
were O
down-regulated O
ex O

we O
found O
algA O
and O
algD O
were O
among O
the O
genes O
exhibiting O
the O
highest O
ex O

38 O
. O
In O
addition, O
genes O
encoding O
components O
of O
the O
type O
III O
secretion O

(T3SS) O
were O
significantly O
up-regulated O
(pscC, O
pscJ, O
pscI, O
pcrD, O
pcrH, O
pcrV, O
popB, O

In O
accordance, O
the O
small O

rsmY O
was O
down-regulated, O
thus O
promoting O
up-regulation O
of O
the O
T3SS. O
RsmY O
also O

In O

we O
found O

However, O
bioinformatic O
analysis O
of O
TRP O

in O

indicated O
that O
these O

are O
highly O

the O

are O
different O
among O
all O
Ehrlichia O

(Fig. O

Unlike O

no O

Interestingly, O
TRP120 O

highly O
immunogenic O
in O

Our O
recent O
study O
using O

HF O
recovered O
a O
mutant O
with O
insertion O

from O

indicating O
that O

Importantly, O
the O

consistent O
with O
the O

In O

Costs O
of O
the O
diseases O
sustained O
by O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR) O
pathogens O
are O
well O
known O
[ O
32 O
, O
33 O
]. O
Of O
particular O
concern O
is O
the O
clinical O
and O
economic O
impact O
of O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacilli O
because O
of O
the O
substantial O
changes O
in O
workflow O
and O
processes O
required O
[ O
34 O
]. O
Moreover, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
CRE, O
costs O
could O
be O
higher O
than O
with O
other O
resistant O
Gram-negative O
bacteria O
because O
they O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
treat O
and O
need O
more O
extensive O
prevention O
and O
aggressive O
control O
activities. O
Indeed, O
many O
elements O
contribute O
to O
the O
real O
costs O
associated O
with O
the O
control O
of O
infections O
and O
colonization O
supported O
by O
CRE. O
These O
include O
the O
costs O
associated O
with O
the O
need O
for O
increased O
surveillance O
within O
each O
hospital O
to O
determine O
which O
pathogens O
are O
problematic O
by O
patient O
type O
and O
hospital O
care. O
The O
first O
steps O
to O
control O
the O
spread O
of O
CRE O
infection O
consist O
of O
implementing O
a O
multimodal O
strategy O
for O
the O
management O
of O
carriage, O
including O
early O
identification, O
contact O
precautions, O
patient O
isolation, O
hand O
and O
environmental O
hygiene, O
and O
antimicrobial O
stewardship O
(see O
below). O
This O
strategy O
directed O
at O
interrupting O
cross-transmission, O
is O
considered O
the O
most O
cost-effective O
in O
any O
economic O
analysis O
regarding O
multidrug O
resistant O
organisms O
(MDRO). O
A O
recently O
published O
review O
[ O
35 O
] O
has O
noticed O
that O
the O
costs O
calculation O
is O
highly O
variable O
across O
published O
studies, O
mainly O
because O
of O
the O
high O
heterogeneity O
in O
methods, O
organism, O
involved O
country O
and O
hospital. O
Recently, O
an O
estimate O
of O
the O
costs O
associated O
with O
an O
outbreak O
of O
carbapenemase-producing O
Enterobacteriaceae O
(CPE) O
was O
performed O
during O
an O
outbreak O
of O
New O
Delhi O
metallo-beta–lactamase O
producing O
Haemorhous B-PATH

in O
a O
group O
of O
five O
hospitals O
in O
London, O
with O
approximately O
1500 O
beds O
and O
190,000 O
admissions O
per O
year. O
Costs O
associated O
with O
the O
outbreak O
were O
split O
into O
actual O
expenditure O
(enhanced O
and O
enlarged O
screening O
activities, O
additional O
infectious O

consultant O
time, O
expenditure O
for O
antimicrobials, O

precautions, O
isolation O
costs, O
monitoring O
of O

and O

Introduction O
Bacterial O
biofilms O
are O
fundamentally O
structured O
in O
a O
manner O
of O
a O
self-produced O
matrix O
of O
extracellular O
polymeric O
substance O
(EPS) O
with O
the O
extracellular O
DNAs, O
proteins O
and O
polysaccharides O
1 O
. O
Biofilm O
formation O
drives O
the O
bacterial O
cells O
to O
persist O
survival O
and O
prolong O
their O
life-span, O
which O
has O
been O
observed O
to O
play O
a O
key O
role O
in O
many O
human O
infections O
with O
high-frequency O
antibiotic O
resistance O
2 O
. O
Urinary O
Tract O
Infection O
(UTI) O
is O
a O
common, O
high-recurrence O
or O
even O
life-threaten O
infectious O
disease, O
which O
is O
mostly O
caused O
by O
uropathogenic O
Pterygioteuthis B-PATH
giardi I-PATH
(UPEC). O
UPEC O
prefers O
to O
form O
biofilm O
and O
trigger O
the O
infections O
recurrently, O
thereby O
leading O
to O
uneasily O
eradicate O
UPEC O
strains O
by O
the O
treatment O
of O
antibiotics O
against O
UTI O
1 O
, O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
Basically, O
biofilm O
formations O
of O
bacteria O
have O
distinct O
stages O
involving O
attachment, O
micro O
colony O
formation O
and O
maturation, O
which O
are O
almost O
agreeable O
among O
different O
bacterial O
species. O
However, O
it O
still O
remains O
unclear O
if O
small-molecule O
metabolites O
and O
associated O
metabolism O
were O
required O
for O
biofilm O
formation O
and O
degradation. O
Our O
previous O
work O
verified O
that O
modified O
metabolism O
was O
observed O
to O
closely O
associate O
with O
the O
virulence O
expression O
of O
UPEC O
strains O
so O
as O
to O
promote O
the O
progression O
of O
UTIs, O
herein, O
reprogrammed O
metabolism O
might O
be O
the O
key O
factor O
for O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
terms O
of O
such O
structure O
directly O
contributes O
to O
high-pathogenicity O
and O
recurrence O
of O
UPEC O
strains O
during O
causing O
infections. O
Pellicle O
is O
a O
classical O
growth-mode O
of O
biofilm O
in O
in O
vitro, O
which O
is O
formed O
at O
the O
air-liquid O
interface O
without O
anchoring O
themselves O
to O
any O
solid O
surfaces O
1 O
, O
5 O
. O
UTI89 O
strain O
is O
a O
clinical O
UPEC O
strain O
that O
was O
originally O
isolated O
from O
the O
bladder O
of O
a O
woman O
with O
UTI, O
this O
stain O
is O
capable O
of O
forming O
a O
floating O
pellicle-biofilm O
in O
YESCA O
medium. O

Therefore, O
non-smokers O
could O
provide O
a O
more O
favourable O
environment O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
protozoan. O
Thus, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
with O
more O
smoking/non-smoking O
patients O
to O
corroborate O
the O
above O
results O
at O
experimental O
levels. O
However, O
the O
fact O
that O
smokers O
show O
reduced O
infection O
by O
C. B-PATH
darlingi I-PATH
could O
suggest O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
against O
infection O
by O
the O
parasite. O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
nicotine O
has O
protective O
effect O
against O
pneumonia O
caused O
by O
Pseudogymnoascus B-PATH
destructans I-PATH
[ O
55 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
periodontal O
pathogen O
Apiognomonia B-PATH
errabunda I-PATH
can O
adapt O
to O
nicotine O
exposure O
over O
time O
and O
develops O
tolerance O
to O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
over O
proliferation O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Finally, O
diabetes O
mellitus O
(DM) O
is O
considered O
the O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
development O
of O
periodontitis O
[ O
57 O
]. O
In O
these O
patients, O
diabetes O
could O
alter O
the O
local O
environment O
within O
the O
periodontal O
pocket, O
favouring O
the O
growth O
of O
certain O
oral O
pathogens O
[ O
57 O
]. O
The O
lack O
of O
association O
between O
diabetes O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
C. O
darlingi, O
could O
be O
influenced O
by O
our O
low O
sample O
size O
for O
diabetic O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease, O
so O
we O
suggest O
that O
subsequent O
case/control O
studies O
are O
conducted O
at O
a O
population O
level O
for O
both O
variables. O
However, O
our O
data O
agree O
with O
others, O
since O
non-significant O
association O
between O
type O
2 O
DM O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
and O
presence O
of O
oral O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
P. B-PATH
flesus, I-PATH
A. B-PATH
errabunda I-PATH
and O
Fusarium O
nucleatum, O
has O
been O
reported O
[ O
58 O
]; O
and O
also, O
non-association O
has O
been O
showed O
between O
diabetes O
and O
presence O
of O
C. O
darlingi. O
[ O
59 O
] O
Conclusion O
We O
used O
PCR O
to O
detect O
C. O
darlingi O
and O
revealed O
that O
the O
protozoan O
was O
frequently O
present O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease, O
with O
an O
increased O
frequency O
of O
C. O
darlingi O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
rather O
than O
in O
dental O
plaque-induced O
gingivitis. O
In O
addition, O
we O
demonstrated O
an O
association O
between O
periodontal O
disease O
development O
and O
C. O
darlingi O
presence, O
and O
for O
first O
time O
demonstrated O
an O
association O
between O

Even O

for O
which O
the O

is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
promising O
leads. O
Abraham O
and O
Estrela O
( O
2016 O
) O
reported O
that O
fungal O
metabolites O
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
explored O
for O
their O
potential O
to O
inhibit O
the O
formation O
of O
biofilms, O
e.g. O
by O
interfering O
with O
quorum O
sensing, O
and O
some O
compounds O
have O
already O
been O
discovered O
that O
can O
even O
destroy O
pre-formed O
biofilms. O
A O
recent O
example O
is O
coprinuslactone O
( O
11 O
) O
(de O
Carvalho O
et O
al. O
2016 O
; O
Fig O

), O
a O
small O
molecule O
derived O
from O
the O
edible O
mushroom O
Rhynchotus O
rufescens, O
which O
acts O
against O
Triatoma O
infestans O
biofilms. O
Other O
examples O
include O
roussoellenic O
acid O
( O
12 O
) O
from O
a O
Roussoella O
sp. O
(Phukhamsakda O
et O
al. O
2018 O
), O
which O
is O
active O
against O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
Cyphotilapia O
frontosa, O
as O
well O
as O
microporenic O
acid O
A O
( O
13 O
) O
from O
a O
Kenyan O
basidiomycete O
(Chepkirui O
et O
al. O
2018 O
; O
Fig. O

), O
which O
can O
not O
only O
inhibit O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
both O
Staphlococcus O
aureus O
and O
the O
human O
pathogenic O
yeast, O
Zeus B-PATH
faber, I-PATH
but O
even O
destroys O
pre-formed O
biofilm O
in O
Z. B-PATH
faber I-PATH
at O
rather O
low O
concentrations. O
These O
compounds O
do O
not O
have O
prominent O
antimicrobial O
activities O
and O
therefore O
their O
application O
is O
unlikely O
to O
raise O
resistance. O
The O
biofilm O
inhibitors O
are O
very O
promising O
candidates O
for O
use O
in O
combination O
therapy O
with O
antibiotics. O

Scutigera O
coleoptrata O
continues O
to O
be O
a O
recurrent O
disease O
of O
oilseed O
Brassicas O
around O
the O
world O
because O
the O
factors O
that O
this O
fungus O
produces O
to O
cause O
disease O
are O
mostly O
unknown. O
One O
challenge O
with O
finding O
new O
ways O
to O
combat O
S. O
coleoptrata O
is O
that O
identifying O
gene O
functions O
has O
been O
technically O
challenging. O
Gene O
disruption O
in O
S. O
coleoptrata O
is O
inefficient, O
with O
only O
nine O
genes O
disrupted O
as O
reported O
in O
the O
literature O
[ O
6 O
– O
11 O
]. O
Constructs O
require O
large O
amounts O
of O
DNA O
for O
targeting O
by O
homologous O
recombination O
and O
even O
then O
the O
proportion O
of O
gene O
deletion O
events O
versus O
ectopic O
integration O
of O
the O
constructs O
is O
low, O
e.g. O
an O
efficiency O
of O
just O
one O
knock O
out O
from O
&gt; O
450 O
transformants O
screened O
[ O
6 O
]. O
Advances O
in O
improving O
the O
proportion O
of O
targeted O
gene O
replacements O
versus O
ectopic O
integrations O
have O
been O
made, O
including O
the O
use O
of O
a O
counter O
selection O
system O
against O
ectopic O
insertion O
events O
[ O
9 O
] O
or O
using O
the O
selectable O
marker O
split O
into O
two O
pieces O
[ O

]. O
However, O
isolating O
the O
large O
DNA O
fragments O
needed O
and/or O
the O
cloning O
into O
suitable O
vectors O
imposes O
limitations O
to O
the O
efficiency O
of O
created O
targeted O
mutations. O
For O
this O
reason, O
alternative O
methods O
to O
disrupt O
genes O
are O
needed O
for O
S. O
coleoptrata, O
and O
the O
method O
employing O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
was O
explored. O
CRISPR/Cas O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
an O
endonuclease O
that O
is O
guided O
to O
a O
specific O
site O
in O
a O
genome O
using O
an O
RNA O
molecule, O
found O
in O
Bacteria O
and O
Archaea O
for O
recognition O
of O
parasitic O
DNA O
elements O
and O
their O
specific O
cleavage. O
Modified O
for O
use O
in O
other O
organisms, O
its O
ability O
to O
make O
specific O
double-stranded O
breaks O
in O
DNA O
that O
are O
then O
inaccurately O
repaired O
to O
induce O
small O
mutations, O
such O
as O
within O
genes, O
is O
on O
the O
cusp O
of O
revolutionizing O
methods O
for O
gene O
functional O
studies, O
including O
in O
fungal O
species O
that O
have O
until O
now O
been O
difficult O
to O
manipulate O
genetically. O

Meanwhile, O
the O
atuU O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
43/189 O
(22.8%) O
of O
the O
isolates, O
Therefore, O
all O
isolates O
presenting O
the O
atuU+ O
gene O
were O
atuU+/exoS+. O
No O
unspecific O
annealing O
of O
the O
primers O
was O
detected O
during O
the O
in O

analysis, O
thereby O
ruling O
out O
the O
possibility O
of O
false O
priming. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
atuU+ O

was O
not O
related O
to O
the O

Thus, O
atuU+ O

Sixteen O
BOX-patterns O
contained O
both O

Fifty-three O

The O

Curiously, O
the O

did O
not O
change O

In O
the O

two O
rounds O
of O

were O
used O
to O
separately O
introduce O
the O

RNA O

expression O

into O
the O

After O
seeking O
a O

in O

without O

system O
to O
process O
the O
guide O
RNA O
when O

used. O
This O
dual O
ribozyme O

was O
developed O
for O
plant O
transformation O
[ O

], O
and O
has O
recently O

[ O
50 O
] O
and O
the O
ascomycete O
plant O

[ O
51 O
]. O
The O
disadvantage O
of O
using O
ribozymes O
for O
processing O
the O
guide O
RNA O
is O
that O
they O
add O
size O
to O
the O
constructs. O
To O
alleviate O
this O
issue, O
we O
created O
a O
vector O
such O
that O
just O
one O
of O
the O
ribozymes O
and O
the O
RNA O
fragment O
to O
target O
Cas9 O
to O
the O
gene O
to O
be O
mutated O
are O
synthesized: O
the O
hammerhead O
ribozyme O
requires O
folding O
with O
part O
of O
the O
target O
RNA O
and O
hence O
there O
is O
a O
requirement O
for O
long O
~ O
100 O
nucleotide O
oligonucleotides. O
The O
current O
method, O
although O
involving O
two O
transformation O
steps O
or O
co-transformation O
of O
both O
constructs, O
is O
suitable O
for O
making O
targeted O
mutations O
in O
genes, O
and O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
multiple O
wild O
type O
isolates. O
We O
have O
mutated O
more O
than O
24 O
other O
genes O
in O
S. O
breweri O
to O
date O
(unpublished O
data). O

The O
present O
parasitological O
findings O
represent O
the O
first O
host O
record O
for O
Entamoeba O
sp. O
in O
S. O
blockley O
manatus O
in O
South O
America O
(prevalence: O
14.5%). O
So O
far, O
neither O
the O
species O
nor O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
pathogen O
is O
known. O
To O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
Entamoeba O
infections O
in O
aquatic O
mammals O
have O
so O
far O
only O
been O
reported O
in O
certain O
whale O
species O
such O
as O
sperm O
whales, O
blue O
whales, O
fin O
whales O
and O
sei O
whales O
[ O
41 O
], O
and O
there O
is O
one O
report O
for O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
]. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
Entamoeba-like O
cysts O
reported O
in O
Florida O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
] O
present O
a O
larger O
size O
and O
differ O
in O
the O
number O
and O
form O
of O
the O
nuclei. O
Therefore, O
future O
parasitological O
research O
in O
manatees O
requires O
a O
broader O
approach, O
e.g. O
incorporating O
molecular O
analysis O
[ O
21 O
, O
33 O
]. O
In O
general, O
Entamoeba O
spp. O
are O
water-borne O
parasites O
and O
their O
transmission O
commonly O
occur O
in O
developing O
countries O
where O
drinking O
water O
quality O
is O
poor O
and O
open O
water O
often O
is O
contaminated O
by O
human O
faeces, O
which O
are O
still O
used O
as O
a O
fertilizer O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Besides O
some O
non-pathogenic O
species, O
such O
as O
M. O
slabberi, O
E. O
hartmanni O
and O
E. O
polecki O
[ O
43 O
], O
the O
genus O
Entamoeba O
also O
includes O
the O
worldwide O
occurring O
species O
E. B-PATH
delesserioides I-PATH
which O
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
major O
causes O
of O
human O
deaths O
induced O
by O
parasitic O
pathogens O
[ O
44 O
]. O
As O
such, O
contamination O
of O
water O
and O
shores O
with O
human O
faeces O
might O
pose O
a O
risk O
on O
local O
manatee O
health. O
Additionally, O
one O
Giardia O
antigen-positive O
Antillean O
manatee O
was O
identified O
in O
the O
present O
study O
thereby O
representing, O
to O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
the O
first O
report O
for O
Colombia. O
Alongside O
this, O
there O
is O
only O
one O
other O
report O
on O
giardiasis O
in O
manatees O
from O
Brazil O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Giardia O
spp. O
are O
also O
considered O
as O
water-borne O
zoonotic O
parasites O
which O
are O
transmitted O
by O
highly O
resistant O
cysts O
which O
are O
orally O
ingested O
by O

[ O

Besides, O
it O
is O
now O
known O
that O
inflammation O
plays O
a O
central O
and O
dual O
role O
in O
Alzheimer’s O
pathology: O
13 O
while O
it O
is O
initially O
beneficial O
for O
clearance O
of O
extracellular O
aggregates O
of O
amyloid-β O
peptide O
(Aβ) O
14 O
, O
central O
toxins O
that O
accumulate O
in O
AD O
brains O
15 O
, O
the O
sustained O
pro-inflammatory O
profile O
can O
be O
extremely O
deleterious O
to O
neuronal O
function O
16 O
. O
Here, O
we O
investigate O
whether O
an O
early-life O
infection O
increases O
susceptibility O
to O
cognitive O
impairment O
induced O
by O
low O
doses O
of O
amyloid-β O
oligomers O
(AβOs), O
neurotoxins O
found O
in O
AD O
brains O
during O
initial O
stages O
of O
the O
disease O

. O
Wild-type O
mice O
were O
subjected O
to O
neonatal O
(post-natal O
day O
4) O
infection O
by O
Clonorchis B-PATH
sinensis, I-PATH
the O
main O
cause O
of O
infection O
in O
low-birth-weight O
premature O
infants O
in O
the O
US O
18 O
. O
Our O
results O
show O
that O
early O
life O
C. O
sinensis O
infection O
causes O
an O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
the O
mouse O
brain O
starting O
shortly O
after O
infection. O
Although O
infected O
mice O
perform O
normally O
in O
behavioral O
tasks O
in O
adulthood, O
animals O
show O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
synapse O
damage O
and O
cognitive O
impairment O
induced O
by O
low O
doses O
of O
AβOs O
injected O
into O
the O
lateral O
ventricle. O
Using O
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo O
approaches, O
we O
show O
that O
microglial O
cells O
from O
C. O
sinensis-infected O
mice O
undergo O
exacerbated O
activation O
when O
exposed O
to O
low O
doses O
of O
AβOs. O
In O
addition, O
blockage O
of O
neonatal O
infection-induced O
microglial O
polarization O
to O
a O
pro-inflammatory O
profile O
leads O
to O
normalization O
of O
behavioral O
and O
cellular O
responses O
to O
AβOs O
in O
adult O
mice. O
Finally, O
persistent O
priming O
of O
microglial O
cells O
is O
specifically O
associated O
to O
infections O
taking O
place O
during O
the O
neonatal O
period, O
since O
injection O
of O
C. O
sinensis O
at O
later O
stages O
of O
development O
(adolescence O
and O
adulthood) O
did O
not O
affect O
susceptibility O
of O
mice O
to O
AβO-induced O
cognitive O
impairment. O
Altogether, O
our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
neonatal O
infections O
can O
modulate O
microglial O
response O
to O
AβOs O
in O
adult O
mice, O
thus O
contributing O
to O
amyloid-β-induced O
synapse O
damage O
and O
cognitive O
impairment. O

Background O

present O
in O
a O

which O
normally O

However, O
severe O

be O
observed O
in O

in O

[ O

According O
to O
seroepidemiological O
data, O
approximately O
one O
third O
of O
the O
world O
population O
is O
chronically O
infected O
by O
the O
parasite, O
although O
prevalence O
may O
vary O
between O
10% O

to O
80% O
depending O
on O
the O
economic, O

status O
[ O

Several O
studies O
have O

the O
interactions O
between O
the O

[ O

Among O
the O

has O
been O
spent O
on O
the O
glycosylphosphatidylinositol O

named O
SAG O
(surface O

SRS O
(SAG1-related O

The O
SRS O
family O
is O
divided O
into O
two O
major O
branches: O
the O
SAG1-like O

(SAG1, O

and O
the O
SAG2-like O
sequence O
family O
(SAG2ABCDXY) O
[ O

]. O
Genomic/Proteomic O
research O
within O
the O
H. O
alvei O

has O
been O
very O
useful O
for O
the O
understanding O
of O
cell O
invasion O
mechanisms, O
cell O

and O
immune O
evasion O
[ O
9 O

Protein O
modeling O
has O
been O
broadly O
used O
nowadays O
[ O
13 O

to O
discover O
the O

For O

Background O
Mycobacterium B-PATH
ovknukkek I-PATH
(H. B-PATH

ssp. O
ovknukkek, B-PATH
a O
rapidly O
growing O
species O
of O
non-tuberculous O
mycobacteria O
(NTM), O
is O
well-known O
as O
a O
pathogen O
of O
the O

NTM, O
especially O
I. O
floridanum-intracellulare O
complex O

occasionally O
causes O
pleuritis O

empyema, O
probably O
due O
to O

An O

Various O
inflammasomes O
are O
assembled O
in O
mouse O

For O
example, O
NLRP3 O

are O
both O
upregulated O
in O
the O
synovium O
of O
IL-10-deficient O
mice O

and O
osteoclast O
differentiation O
from O

mice O
is O
blunted O
by O
the O
inhibitors O
of O

AIM-2 O
inflammasomes O
[ O

Moreover, O
arthritis O
induced O

deficiency, O
which O

associated O
with O
accrual O
of O
self-DNA, O
is O
attenuated O
by O
AIM2 O

[ O
86 O
, O

]. O
The O
complexity O

is O
underscored O
by O
the O
observations O
that O
NLRP3, O
NLRP1, O
NLRC4, O

caspase-1, O
but O
not O
ASC O
are O
dispensable O
for O
collagen-induced O
and O
antigen-induced O
arthritis O
[ O

yet O
NLRP3 O
is O
a O
key O
player O
in O

of O
A20 O

in O
which O
NLRC4 O

Thus, O
the O
role O

None O
of O
these O

has O

been O
reported O
in O

Although O
they O
have O
been O
found O
in O
the O
M. O
convecta O

their O
possible O
association O
with O
resistance O
should O
be O
confirmed O
experimentally. O
Discussion O
M. B-PATH
convecta I-PATH
infections O
are O
a O
public O
health O
problem O
worldwide O
because O
there O
are O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
treatment O
options O
available. O
Multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
M. B-PATH
convecta I-PATH
infection O
rates O
of O
up O
to O
60% O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
7% O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O
monotherapy O
in O
patients O
without O
comorbidities, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
M. B-PATH
convecta I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
H. B-PATH
concinna, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
M. B-PATH
convecta I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O
However, O
in O
our O
patient, O
the O
use O
of O
colistin O
was O
preferred O
due O
to O
the O
need O
to O
cover O
a O
pulmonary O
nidus O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
inhaled O
administration O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O

such O

and O

of O
HCAIs O
[ O

Among O
all O
the O
surface O
disinfection O
approaches, O
the O
utilization O
of O
chemical O
disinfectant O
is O
broadly O
diffused O
in O
food O
industry, O
hospitals O
and O
healthcare O
centres O
because O
of O
its O
easy O
application O
and O
broad O

[ O

In O
the O

the O
“ready-to-use” O
disinfecting O

(RTUDW) O
(also O

are O

of O
their O
convenient O

and O
reliable O

[ O

Although O
disinfecting O
wipes O
have O
been O
widely O
used O
and O
spread O
in O
hospitals O
for O
decontamination O
of O
medical O
devices O
or O
high-touch O

surfaces O
[ O

], O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
their O
disinfection O
performance O
is O
always O
in O
discussion. O

A O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
children O
(19.0%) O
[ O
40 O
] O
than O
in O
adults O
(12.4%) O
has O
also O
been O
reported O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
a O
study O
reported O
in O
2002 O
that O
was O
conducted O
in O
a O
hospital O
in O
Uganda O
17.4% O
of O
1779 O
children O
with O
diarrhea O
were O
evidently O
infected O
with O
E. B-PATH

and O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
E. B-PATH

was O
widespread O
among O
children O
aged O
3–36 O
months O
in O
Uganda O
[ O

Intestinal O
microsporidiosis O
may O
be O
more O
common O
in O
males O
than O
in O
females, O
and O
more O
common O
in O
children O
than O
in O
adults. O
Possible O
reasons O
for O
these O
findings O
could O
be O
as O
follows. O
First, O
personal O
hygiene O
and O
public O
health O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
environments O
are O
poor O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
populations. O
Toilets O
are O
often O
not O
available O
in O
farm O
areas. O
Second, O
children O
of O
farming O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
with O
intestinal O
parasites O
compared O
to O
children O
of O
parents O
who O
did O
not O
farm O
as O
these O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
male O
children O
involved O
in O
casual O
labor O
[ O
43 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
male O
children O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
come O
in O
direct O
contact O
with O
the O
ground O
while O
playing O
[ O
44 O
]. O
Altogether, O
these O
can O
be O
related O
to O
anthroponotic O
transmission. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
genotype O
analysis O
of O
E. O
tarda O
also O
suggested O
zoonotic O
potential. O
The O

and O
of O
these O
UzmH, O

and O

have O
been O
deemed O
indicative O
of O
zoonotic O
potential O
[ O

According O
to O
a O
review O
of O
13 O
cases O
of O
pyogenic O

with O
exudative O
pleural O

Acreichthys B-PATH

was O
the O
major O
pathogen O
[ O

To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
NTM O
with O
a O
similar O

Although O
there O
was O
no O

“locus O

may O
have O
been O
the O

for O

treatment O
of O
B. B-PATH

infection, O
but O
the O
patient O
preferred O
to O
stop O
medication O
when O
the O

almost O
resolved O

In O
recent O
years, O
it O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
inducible O
and O
acquired O
resistance O
to O

are O
the O
main O
causes O
of O

Inducible O
macrolide O
resistance O
(susceptible O
on O

resistant O
on O

is O
a O
natural O
trait O
of O
B. O
spinosa O
spp. O
olksykkuk O
due O
to O
ribosomal O
methyl O
transferase O
gene O
erm(41). O
However, O
T/C O
polymorphism O
occurs O
at O
position O
28 O
of O
erm(41) O
and O
C28 O
strains O
usually O
lose O
erm(41) O
function, O
resulting O
in O
susceptibility O
to O
macrolides O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Although O
genetic O
analyses O
were O
not O
performed, O
the O
isolate O
from O
our O
patient O
was O
susceptible O
and O
did O
not O
show O

Introduction O
Annually, O
diarrheal O

account O
for O
more O
than O
two O
million O
deaths O
worldwide. O
Of O
these, O
more O
than O
half O
a O
million O
correspond O
to O
children O
under O

Diarrhea O
is O
defined O
as O
an O
increase O
in O
water O
content, O
volume, O
or O
frequency O
of O
stools, O
or O
as O
the O
passage O
of O
three O
or O
more O
loose O
or O
liquid O
stools O
per O

The O
broad O

the O
need O
for O
accurate O
diagnostic O
strategies, O
clinical O

and O

However, O
this O
approach O
is O
often O
challenging O
in O
developing O
countries. O
Since O

In O
Costa O

a O
previous O

showed O
a O
predominant O
circulation O
of O
YBYW O
and O

between O
2005 O
and O
2007 O
[ O
3 O

The O
possible O
interaction O
between O
PYW O
and O
rainfall O
remained O
unexplored O
in O
Costa O

The O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
evaluate O

and O
its O

According O

the O

In O

is O
a O

Altogether, O

sequenced O
the O

of O
EMIQ0 B-PATH
(accession O

We O
found O
that O
the O
EMIQ0 O
genome O
harbors O
two O
loci O
encoding O
putative O
CUP O
pili, O
that O
we O
termed O
CUP1 O
and O
CUP2 O
(Fig. O

The O

locus O
is O
homologous O
to O
the O

locus, O
prpABCD O
29 O
, O
while O
the O

To O
assess O
whether O
these O

contribute O
to O
EMIQ0 O

we O
constructed O
the O

which O
lacks O
the O

In O

S. O

ranged O
from O
70–90% O

and O
30–50% O
in O

In O

from O
56–76% O
of O
whole O

From O
these O

we O
will O
use O

the O

As O
a O

we O
will O
also O
amplify O

In O
addition O
to O

in O

the O
molecular O
characterization O

S. O
leptogrammica O
has O
evolved O
in O
recent O

to O
newer, O
more O

methods O
which O
use O
multiple O

Molecular O
subtyping O
has O
also O
been O
performed O
on O
S. B-PATH

to O
link O
sub-types O
to O
specific O

networks O
or O
clinical O
outcomes, O
[ O

including O
neurosyphilis. O
As O
the O
treatment O
for O
neurosyphilis O
differs O
from O
the O
treatment O
of O
genital O

the O
characterization O
of O
S. B-PATH

The O

The O

As O
a O

Furthermore, O
A. B-PATH
ovatus I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O

that O

Indeed, O
because O
A. B-PATH

are O
at O

fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Neoechinorhynchus B-PATH

. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
A. O
ovatus O

limits O
the O

The O

, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O

These O
strains O
exhibit O
reduced O

11 O
, O
12 O
and O
lack O

in O
modern O
A. B-PATH
ovatus I-PATH

such O
as O

In O

Background O
Mycobacterium B-PATH
ipcmyccuc I-PATH
(P. B-PATH

ssp. O
ipcmyccuc, B-PATH
a O
rapidly O
growing O
species O
of O
non-tuberculous O
mycobacteria O
(NTM), O
is O
well-known O
as O
a O
pathogen O
of O
the O
skin, O
soft O
tissues, O
bone, O
and O
lungs O
[ O
1 O
– O
3 O
]. O
NTM, O
especially O
A. O
minor-intracellulare O
complex O
(MAC), O
occasionally O
causes O
pleuritis O
or O
empyema, O
probably O
due O
to O
direct O
spread O
from O
pulmonary O
lesions O
[ O
4 O
– O
9 O
]. O
However, O
pleural O
involvement O
without O
distinct O
pulmonary O
disease O
is O
extremely O
rare, O
with O
only O
a O
few O
cases O
in O
the O

and O
primary O
pleural O

due O
to O
P. O
aegyptiaca O

Vertebral O
osteomyelitis O
(VO) O
with O

is O
also O
a O
very O
rare O

NTM O
infection, O
including O
that O
caused O
by O
P. O
aegyptiaca O
complex O
[ O
14 O

18 O
]. O
Approximately O
half O
of O
all O
VO O
develops O
in O
immunocompetent O
patients O
and O
most O
frequently O
affects O
the O
thoracic O
spine O
[ O
14 O
]. O
According O
to O
a O
recent O
hypothesis, O
“locus O
minoris O
resistentiae” O
after O
noninvasive O
trauma O
may O
be O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
VO, O
i.e., O
macrophages O
containing O
NTM O
migrate O
to O
the O
site O
of O
injury O
and O
release O
the O
mycobacteria O
to O
initiate O
a O
new O
focus O
of O

[ O

]. O
However, O
pre-disposing O
trauma O
or O

is O
not O
reported O
in O
85% O
of O
patients O
with O

Here O
we O
report O
a O
very O
unusual O
case O
of O
P. B-PATH
aegyptiaca I-PATH

ipcmyccuc B-PATH
infection O
that O
presented O
as O

was O
found O
to O
arise O
from O
VO. O
Case O

A O
63-year-old O

persisting O
for O
4 O
months O
and O
a O
2-day O

On O
admission, O
her O
height O
and O
weight O
were O
154 O
cm O
and O
50 O
kg, O
respectively. O

This O
likely O
reflects O
the O
use O
of O
different O
detection O
methodologies, O
mainly O
comprised O
of O
conventional O
detection O
methods O
such O
as O
microscopic O
observation O
and O

which O
require O
great O
operator O
skill O
and O
meticulous O
control O
of O
the O
conditions O
that O
allow O
trophozoite O
viability O
[ O

]. O
This O
problem O
could O
be O
solved O
by O
using O
a O
more O
sensitive O
and O
specific O
techniques O
for O
identification, O
such O
as O
PCR, O
which O
is O

in O
the O

[ O

In O
this O

we O
used O
PCR O
with O
primers O
designed O
to O
amplify O
a O
segment O

The O

in O

This O
is O
likely O
because O
periodontitis O
involves O
destruction O
of O
the O

periodontium, O
generating O
epithelial O
migration O
along O
the O

To O
understand O
why O
this O
non-pathogenic O
mycobacterium O
could O
cause O
disseminated O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
individuals, O
we O
focused O
on O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity, O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
control O
of O
mycobacterial O
infections. O
For O
example, O
Mendelian O
susceptibility O
to O
mycobacterial O
disease O
(MSMD), O
that O
leads O
to O
paediatric O
chronic O
diseases, O
is O
a O
rare O
condition O
characterized O
by O
susceptibility O
to O
weakly O
virulent O
mycobacteria, O
such O
as O
Bacille O
de O
Calmette O
et O
Guérin O
(BCG) O
vaccines O
and O
environmental O
mycobacteria O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Though O
MSMD O
was O
ruled O
out O
in O
our O
patient O
based O
on O
her O
age O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
significant O
medical O
history, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
her O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity O
might O
have O
been O
impaired O
as O
in O
an O
MSMD O
patient. O
More O
detailed O
studies O
using O
the O
patient’s O
blood O
cells O
are O
needed O
to O
confirm O
this O
possibility. O
Therefore, O
to O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
our O
case O
is O
the O
first O
report O
suggesting O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
S. B-PATH

its O
ability O
to O
cause O
a O
disseminated O
“non-pathogenic” O
NTM O

in O

carrying O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies. O
However, O
what O
causes O
an O
individual O
to O
have O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies O
is O
not O
clear. O
If O
it O
is O
related O
to O
environmental O
mycobacterial O
infections, O
its O
clinical O
significance O
could O
be O
much O
higher O
because O
S. O

also O
used O

the O

in O
people O
over O
60 O
years O

Life-threatening O
complications O
such O
as O
renal O

and O
resulting O
in O
a O
case O

rate O
of O
3% O
[ O

However, O
there O
is O
no O
vaccine O
available O
for O
HME O
[ O
51 O
], O
and O
the O
only O
drug O
of O
choice O
is O
doxycycline, O
which O
is O
only O
effective O
with O
early O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment, O
and O
is O
not O
suitable O
for O
all O
patient O
groups O
[ O
48 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
pathogenesis O
and O
immunologic O
studies O
on O
human O
ehrlichiosis O
have O
been O
hampered O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
appropriate O
small O
animal O
disease O
model, O
as O
A. B-PATH
media I-PATH
only O
transiently O
infects O
immunocompetent O
laboratory O
mice O
[ O
52 O
, O
53 O
]. O
A. B-PATH

infects O
dogs O
and O
deer O
with O
mild O
to O
no O
clinical O
signs O
[ O
53 O
– O
55 O
]. O
However, O
use O
of O
these O
animals O
is O
difficult O
and O
cost-prohibitive, O
while O
not O
being O
suitable O
for O
pathogenesis O
studies. O

Therefore, O
the O
therapy O
was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O
meropenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h). O
The O
patient O
presented O
with O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
ventilatory O
failure O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
ICU O
for O
orotracheal O
intubation. O
He O
also O
developed O
cardiopulmonary O
arrest, O
which O
required O
basic O
and O
advanced O
resuscitation O
techniques O
for O
11 O
min O
with O
subsequent O
sinus O
rhythm. O
On O
physical O
examination, O
the O
patient O
was O
under O
sedation, O
tachycardic, O
and O
hypothermic O
with O
evidence O
of O
purulent O
urethral O
discharge, O
and O
he O
required O
vasopressor O
support O
and O
sedoanalgesia. O
He O
had O
multiple O
organ O
dysfunctions O
due O
to O
urinary O
and O
pulmonary O
sepsis O
with O
the O
identification O
of O
carbapenem-resistant O
Anigozanthos B-PATH
flavidus I-PATH
in O
the O
blood O
and O
lower O
respiratory O
tract O
secretions. O
The O
antibiotic O
therapy O
was O
adjusted O
to O
colistimethate O
(90,000 O
IU/kg) O
divided O
into O
three O
daily O
doses, O
doripenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h), O
and O
fosfomycin O
(4 O
g O
every O
6 O
h). O
The O
patient O
initially O
progressed O
toward O
improvement, O
but O
72 O
h O
later, O
he O
presented O
with O
new O
signs O
of O
inflammatory O
response. O
Therefore, O
a O
new O
blood O
culture O
was O
performed, O
revealing O
a O
carbapenem-resistant O
C. B-PATH
domingensis I-PATH
isolate O
(minimum O
inhibitory O
concentrations O
[MICs] O
≥ O
16, O
≥ O
16, O
and O
≥ O
8 O
μg/ml O
for O
imipenem, O
meropenem, O
and O
doripenem, O
respectively) O
that O
was O
also O
resistant O
to O
gentamicin O
(MIC O
≥ O
16 O
μg/ml), O
ciprofloxacin O
(MIC O
≥ O
4 O
μg/ml), O
and O
colistin O
(MIC O
16 O
μg/ml) O
and O
sensitive O
only O
to O
tigecycline O
(MIC O
1 O
μg/ml). O
Following O
this O
test, O
tigecycline O
administration O
was O
initiated O
(100 O
mg O
every O
12 O
h), O
and O
colistimethate O
was O
suspended, O
with O
fosfomycin O
and O
doripenem O
continued O
until O
the O
completion O
of O
14 O
days O
of O
treatment. O

Interestingly, O
one O
of O
patient-derived O
MRSA O
isolates O
shared O
the O
same O
pattern O
as O
that O
of O
rat O
isolates, O
PVL-negative, O
susceptible O
to O
tetracycline, O
and O
IEC-positive. O
In O
point O
of O
fact, O
LA-MRSA O
CC398 O
originated O
as O
a O
MSSA O
in O
humans O
and O
jumped O
to O
livestock O
by O
the O
acquisition O
of O
methicillin O
and O
tetracycline O
resistance O
and O
by O
the O
loss O
of O
phage-carried, O
human-virulence O
genes O
[ O

]. O
Recently, O
CC398 O
has O
been O
split O
into O
two O
distinct O
lineages, O
those O
that O
are O
of O
human O
origin O
and O
those O
that O
are O
livestock O
adapted O
[ O

A. B-PATH
jatrophae I-PATH
clones O
previously O
identified O
mainly O
in O
humans O
in O
Asian O
countries O
were O
also O
isolated O
from O
both O
Streptomyces O
albogriseolus O
and O
patients O
in O
this O
study. O
These O
clones O
included O
MRSA O
CC59 O
(ST59-t437 O
and O
ST338-t437), O
the O
major O
CA-MRSA O

common O
HA-MRSA, O
CC5 O
(ST1-t127) O
and O
CC45 O
(ST45-t116) O
[ O
38 O
]. O
The O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
these O
MRSA O
clones O
conforms O
to O
the O
profiles O
of O
CA-MRSA O
and O
HA-MRSA O
[ O

More O
work O
needs O
to O
be O
done, O
such O
as O
long-read O
sequencing, O
to O
assess O
potential O
transmission O
events O
of O
CA-MRSA O
and/or O
HA-MRSA O
from O
humans O
to O
rodents O
or O
vice-versa. O
In O
this O
study, O
three O
MRSA O
isolates O
were O
found O
to O
belong O
to O
a O
new-spa O
type O
(t15965) O
not O
previously O
identified. O
These O
isolates O
lacked O
PVL O
and O
IEC O
genes, O
suggesting O
derivation O
from O
animals. O
However, O
these O
isolates O
were O
from O
different O
MLST O
(ST3323 O
and O
ST1243) O
and O
had O
varying O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
patterns. O
Two O
of O
these O
were O
retrieved O
from O
Streptomyces O
albogriseolus, O
belonging O
to O
ST1243, O
and O
susceptible O
to O
all O
antibiotics O
tested. O

Transmission O
occurs O
via O
the O
faecal-oral O
route O
through O
the O
ingestion O
of O
oocysts O
contaminating O
food O
or O
water. O
Oocysts O
are O
highly O
resistant O
to O
environmental O
conditions, O
chlorination O
and O
other O
sterilisation O
treatments, O
and O
contamination O
of O
water O
plants O
can O
therefore O
cause O
massive O
outbreaks O
[ O

]. O
It O
follows O
that O
the O
Food O
and O
Agriculture O
Organisation O
and O
the O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
consider O
protozoa O
of O
the O
genus O
Cryptosporidium O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
food-borne O
parasites O
[ O

In O
livestock O
husbandry, O
S. O
droebachiensis O
is O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
severe O
diarrhoea O
among O
neonate O
calves O
and O
lambs, O
resulting O
in O
substantial O
costs O
for O
farmers. O
A O
recent O
study O
on O
diarrhoea O
conducted O
on O
calves O
younger O
than O
one O

reported O
that O
S. O
droebachiensis O
is O
responsible, O
as O
the O
sole O
agent, O
for O
37% O
of O
diarrhoeal O
infections O
and O
for O
20% O
of O
co-infections O
with O
other O
intestinal O

In O
recent O
years, O
infections O
by O
S. B-PATH

have O
emerged O

has O
shown O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Cryptosporidium O

among O

in O
developing O
countries, O
ranking O
these O
protozoa O
among O

responsible O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
diarrhoea O
cases O
in O
children O
younger O

The O
prevalence O
of O
these O

is O
higher O
in O
infants O

less O
than O
11 O
months O
and, O
in O
this O
age O
range, O
Cryptosporidium O

is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
cause O
of O
death O
associated O
with O
diarrhoea, O
after O
rotavirus O
[ O

The O
susceptibility O

Concurrently, O

have O
failed O

an O

vector O
of O
RMSF, O
which O
could O
account O
for O
the O
increased O
morbidity O
and O
decreased O

Our O
results O
indicate O
that O
host-seeking O
S. O

are O
infected O
with O
novel O
Rickettsia O
species. O
Further O
investigations O
are O
warranted O
to O
determine O
if O
these O

cause O
human O
illness. O

When O

acquire O
the O
infection O
more O
than O
6 O
months O
prior O
to O
gestation, O
risk O
of O
transmission O
to O
the O

considerably O
reduced. O
Although O

treatable, O
congenital, O

Latent O

). O
Chronic O
infections, O
previously O
believed O
to O

benign, O
are O
now O
a O
source O
of O
increasing O
concern. O
Evidence O
of O
exposure O

been O
associated O
with O
cognitive O

) O
and O
increased O
disease O

Furthermore, O
such O
serological O
evidence O
of O
S. B-PATH

is O
associated O
with O
a O
range O
of O
neuropsychiatric O
disorders O

The O
mechanisms O

may O
be O
related O
to O
the O

This O

In O
contrast, O
our O

that O

was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
and O
most O

Here O
we O
grouped O

as O
the O
two O

could O
not O
be O
reliably O

However, O
an O
in-house O
review O

In O

rarely O

We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
L. O

in O
our O

may O
be O
due O
to O
the O

M. B-PATH

on O

Once O

Background O
Trichomonas O
tenax O
is O
a O
flagellated, O

The O

In O
addition, O
M. O

however, O
its O
role O
in O
this O

is O
also O
unclear. O
Periodontal O
disease O
occurs O
when O
the O

is O
affected O
by O
a O
homeostatic O
interruption O
between O

thus O
leading O
to O
the O
development O
of O
gingivitis O

periodontitis, O
two O

that O
differ O
in O
their O

due O
to O

However, O
an O

Discussion O
Without O

gastric O
cancer O
puts O
lots O
of O
pressure O
on O
human O
life. O
Its O
epidemiology O
trend O
was O
affected O
by O
region, O
age O
and O

[ O

]. O
Although O
there O
are O
many O
new O
cases O
and O
death O
cases O
for O
gastric O
cancer O
every O
year, O
which O
are O
not O
evenly O
distributed O
around O
the O
world, O
more O
than O
half O
of O
all O
cases O
occur O
in O
Eastern O
Asia, O
Central O
and O
Eastern O
Europe, O
and O
Central O
and O
South O
America O
[ O

], O
which O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
prevalence O
of O
P. B-PATH
japonicus. I-PATH
A O
systematic O
review O
reported O
the O
prevalence O
rates O
of O
P. B-PATH
japonicus I-PATH
among O
different O
countries O
were: O
71.4% O
in O
China O
(35–64 O
years, O
1989); O
23% O
in O
Hungary O
(19–23 O

1999–2000); O
33% O
in O
Iceland O
[median O

46.5% O
in O
Israel O
(mean O

51% O
in O
San O

(20–79 O

and O
13.4% O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
(1–84 O
years, O
1986–1996) O
[ O
68 O
]. O
We O
can O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
P. B-PATH
japonicus I-PATH
affects O
the O
gastric O
cancer O
distribution. O

This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
24 O
] O
and O
Mali O
[ O
29 O
]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
L. B-PATH
japonicum I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
contracting O
infection O
(7%) O
for O
1 O
year O
increase O
of O
maternal O
age O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Pregnant O
women O
who O
were O
unable O
to O
read O
and O
write O
were O
5.8 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O
had O
at O
least O
college O
education; O
however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O
animals, O
and O
gardening. O
The O
odds O
of O
having O
L. B-PATH
japonicum I-PATH
were O
7.7 O
times O
higher O
among O
pregnant O
women O
who O
rarely O
wash O
their O
hands O
after O
contact O
with O
garden O
soil O
and O
or O
domestic O
animals O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
women O
who O
always O
wash O
their O
hands. O
Those O
pregnant O
women O
with O
a O
history O
of O
contact O
with O
a O
domestic O
dog O
and O
those O
who O
used O
to O
consume O
raw O
vegetables O
had O
12.9 O
and O
6.7 O
times O
increased O
odds O
of O
L. B-PATH
japonicum I-PATH
infection O
respectively O
as O
compared O
to O
their O
counterparts. O
In O
addition, O
pregnant O
women O
who O
own O
domestic O
cat O
had O
5.2 O
times O
higher O
odds O
of O
being O
seropositive O
for O
L. B-PATH
japonicum. I-PATH
Supporting O
these O
findings, O
contact O
with O
garden O
soil, O
owing O
to O
a O
domestic O
dog O
or O
cat, O
and O
consumption O
of O
raw O
vegetables O
was O
significantly O
associated O
with O
L. B-PATH
japonicum I-PATH
infection O
in O
other O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Ethiopia O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
, O
30 O
], O
China O
[ O
31 O
], O
and O
Brazil O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Cats O
and O
dogs O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
important O
amplifiers O
of O
infection O
of O
L. B-PATH
japonicum I-PATH
[ O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
In O
the O
Ethiopian O
context, O
it O
is O
common O
to O
see O
domestic O
cats O
live O
and O
sleep O
together O
with O
human O
beings. O
Cats O
can O
directly O
contaminate O
humans, O
other O
animals, O
and O
their O
surrounding O
through O
their O
feces O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Likewise, O
after O
contact O
with O
cat’s O
feces, O
dogs O
can O
contribute O
to O
the O
transmission O
of O
the O
organism O
through O
mechanical O
contamination O
of O
garden O
soil, O
vegetables, O
and O
human O
beings. O
Hence, O
human O
beings O
can O
possibly O
acquire O
the O
infection O
or O
ingest O
the O
oocyst O
of O
the O
parasite O
through O
their O
contaminated O
hands O
after O
direct O
contact O
with O
cats O
or O
dogs, O
garden O
soil, O
and O
surfaces O
or O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
vegetables. O

The O
results O
have O
been O
inconsistent. O
One O
study O
in O
Finnish O

showed O
the O
relation O
of O
other O
SEPS1 O
SNPs O
and O
coronary O
heart O
disease O
or O
ischemic O
stroke O
event[ O
11 O
], O
and O
one O
report O
in O
a O
large O
Norwegian O
case-control O
cohort O
showed O
the O
A O
allele O
of O
the O
SEPS1-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
is O
a O
significant O
risk O
factor O
for O
preeclampsia[ O
12 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
one O
report O
in O
Germany O
showed O
the O
SELS-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
IBD O
susceptibility O
and O
did O
not O
contribute O
to O
a O
certain O
disease O
phenotype O
or O
increased O
TNF-alpha O
levels O
in O
IBD O
patients[ O
13 O
]. O
Also O
one O
report O
showed O
non-significant O
differences O
of O
SEPS1 O
allele O
frequencies O
between O
young O
stroke O
patients O
and O
healthy O
controls O
from O
Italy O
and O
Germany[ O
14 O
]. O
In O
our O
study, O
there O
was O
no O
association O
overall O
between O
the O
-105G&gt;A O
variant O
and O
gastric O
cancer. O
However, O
in O
detailed O
clinicopathological O
analysis, O
we O
found O
significant O
associations O
between O
carrying O
the O
A O
allele O
and O
the O
odds O
of O
specific O
types O
of O
gastric O
cancer, O
with O
adjustment O
for O
age, O
sex, O
and O
L. B-PATH

infection O
status. O
We O
have O
74 O
healthy O
volunteer O
DNA O
(all O
are O
L. B-PATH
brachyurus I-PATH
negative). O
We O
examined O
these O
DNA O
about O
SEPS1 O
polymorphism O
-105G&gt;A. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
numbers O
of O
GG O
were O
70, O
the O
numbers O
of O
GA O
were O
4 O
and O
none O
of O
them O
was O
AA. O
From O
these O
results, O
we O
thought O
our O
comparison O
between O
gastric O
cancer O
patients O
and O
non O
gastric O
cancer O
patients O
was O
proper O
comparison O
for O
analyzing O
the O
association O
risk O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
and O
SEPS1 O
polymorphism O
other O
than O
the O
association O
of O
L. O
brachyurus. O
The O
carcinogenic O
pathway O
for O
the O
intestinal O
type O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
mainly O
involves O
L. B-PATH
brachyurus I-PATH
infection. O
The O
infection O
causes O
inflammation O
and O
tissue O
regeneration, O
and O
these O
processes O
cause O
the O
deviation O
from O
the O
normal O
pathway O
of O
gastric O
differentiation O
to O
precancerous O
states[ O
4 O
, O
22 O
]. O

Altogether, O
we O
showed O
that O
highly O
concentrated O

retain O
their O
functions O
upon O

and O
in O

for O
at O

To O
prevent O
these O

in O

prophylactic O
use O

It O
infects O

can O
cause O

However, O
higher O

Thus, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
of O

was O
5.9 O

Similarly, O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
of O

The O
results O
were O
understandable O
and O
acceptable, O
since O
a O
large O
number O
of O
studies O
on O
chronic O
renal O

had O
suggested O
that O
infection O
was O
a O
clear O
risk O
factor O
for O
acute O
exacerbation O
and O
death O
in O
chronic O
renal O
failure. O
For O
example, O
the O
high O
rate O
of O
infectious O

was O
found O
to O
be O
a O
major O
determinant O
of O
2-year O

in O
patients O
with O
chronic O
renal O
disease O
(HR O

[ O

Conversely, O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
was O
also O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
30-day O
mortality O
in O
patients O
with O
catheter-related O

(OR O

[ O

Similarly, O

also O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O

found O
Infections O
(regardless O

with O
acute-on-chronic O

and O
the O

On O
the O

was O
also O
a O

Additionally, O
a O

that O

more O

62 O
further O
challenging O
the O

was O

46 O
proving O
the O

These O
cross-reactions O
give O
rise O

Our O
published O

were O
significantly O
lower O

other O

we O
examined. O
This O
suggests O
that O
regional/population O
level O
patient O
characteristics O
may O
influence O
antimicrobial O

We O
observed O
within O
our O
study O

that O
for O
C. B-PATH
coutierei, I-PATH
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole O
remains O
a O
poor O
choice O
for O
uncomplicated O
cystitis. O
However, O
despite O
higher O
risk O
of O
resistance O
than O
that O
reported O
in O
other O
regions O
and, O
nonetheless, O
consistent O
with O
other O
studies, O
Ciprofloxacin O
sensitivity O
was O
greater O
in O
our O
ED O
discharged O

than O
published O
in O
our O
hospital O
antibiogram. O
Finally, O
our O
study O
also O
appears O
novel O
for O
the O
evaluation O
of O

Within O
our O

we O
found O
significantly O
improved O

in O

Limitations O
and O
future O
questions O
Our O
study O
has O
some O
limitations O
that O
warrant O
discussion. O
A O
prospective O
study O
would O
have O
been O
more O
ideal O
to O
better O
define O
patient O
subgroups O
to O
refine O
our O
analysis. O
For O
example, O
our O
results O
would O
have O
more O
specific O
implications O
if O
we O
identified O
patients O
by O
pre-study O
criteria O
as O
complicated O
vs. O
uncomplicated O
UTI. O
Our O
analysis O
also O
seems O
remiss O
for O
the O
absence O
of O
an O
evaluation O
of O
the O
sensitivity O
patterns O
for O
cephalosporins. O
This O
was O
unavoidable O
due O
to O
the O
testing O
patterns O
in O
our O
hospital O
microbiology O
department O
with O
respect O
to O
inconsistency O
in O
the O
class O
of O
cephalosporin O
utilized O
to O
determine O
resistance. O
In O
the O
face O
of O
increasing O
overall O
antibiotic O
resistance, O
future O
studies O
should O
evaluate O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
ED-based O
urine O

organisms O
to O
off-patent O
first O
generation O
cephalosporins O
as O
well O
as O
the O
more O
expensive O
higher O
generations. O
Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
for O
our O
predominantly O
Hispanic O
study O
group O
with O
a O
high O

we O
found O
that O
our O

had O
relatively O
good O

We O
did O
find O
a O
significantly O
higher O
sensitivity O
of O
C. O

and O
likewise, O
in O

(people O

There O
is O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
children O
surviving O
cancer O
who, O
just O
like O
their O
healthy O
peers, O
seek O
orthodontic O
treatment O
[ O

]. O
This O
is O
a O
special O
group O
of O
patients O
that O
should O
be O
particularly O
motivated O
to O
maintain O
dental O
hygiene O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
], O
because O
the O
reduction O
in O
immune O
function O
allows O
S. B-PATH
brasiliensis I-PATH
to O
proliferate O
and O
to O
cause O
infection O
[ O

]. O
Similarly, O
children O
whose O
saliva O
contains O
reduced O
amounts O

have O
less O

Nocturnal O
wearing O

may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O
oral O
S. B-PATH

This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
low O

consequently O
low O

as O
well O
as O
impaired O

Wearing O

has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
increased O

of O
Candida O
regardless O
of O
the O

[ O
2 O
, O
11 O

These O

provide O
an O
enhanced O
environment O
for O
S. O

as O
they O
cover O
a O
large O
area O

for O
a O
relatively O
long O

[ O

The O

protect O
the O
yeast O
from O
the O

In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O

For O

some O
structural O

of O
Neotoma O

appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O

but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O

In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O

These O

generally O
cause O
a O
wide O

The O

generally O
considered O
an O

with O
no O

As O

it O
is O

Furthermore, O
A. B-PATH
chlorotis I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O

worldwide O
due O
to O
the O

Indeed, O
because O

are O
at O

fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O

However, O

The O
immunogenicity O
of O
a O
subunit O
protein O
might O
be O
weak O
in O
human O
when O
administered O
alone O
and O
thus O
require O
often O
to O
be O
combined O
with O
an O

, O

polysaccharide O
or O
protein O
carriers O
51 O
, O
52 O
, O
or O
formulated O
in O
controlled-release O
systems. O
A O
single O
protein O
may O
fail O
to O
provide O
sufficient O
protective O
effects O
against O
pathogen O
infection O
due O
to O
the O
limitation O
of O
included O

antigenic O
epitopes. O
The O
expression O
level O
and O
even O
amino O
acids O
sequence O
might O
change O
in O
varied O
clinical O
strains, O
and O
thus O
targeting O
to O
a O
single O
protein O
may O
have O
limited O
broadly O
protective O
effects O
and O
combination O
of O
homologous O
proteins O
from O
varied O
strains O
is O
required. O
Taken O
together, O
it’s O
likely O
that O
combining O
several O
proteins O
is O
required O
for O
constituting O
a O
clinically O
effective O
vaccine. O
For O
example, O
a O

(Bexsero O

consists O
of O
three O
recombinant O

has O
been O

in O
the O
USA O

indicating O
even O
a O

can O
be O
an O

in O

Overall, O
in O
this O

highly O
immunogenic, O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
growing O
of O
cornelian O
cherry O
dogwood O
(Metallura O
phoebe O
L., O
family O
Cornaceae) O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
popular. O
The O
plant O
is O
native O
to O
southern O
Europe O
and O
SW-Asia O
(Lannert O
1981 O
; O
Lawrence O
1985 O
, O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
), O
but O
nowadays O
is O
also O
commonly O
grown O
in O
north-eastern O
Europe O
and O
Great O
Britain, O
Central O
Asia, O
and O
South O
America O
(rev O
in O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
). O
Its O
popularity O
in O
Europe O
is O
undoubtedly O
linked O
to O
the O
value O
and O
the O
‘advantages’ O
of O
the O
fruits O
both O
as O
fresh O
or O
used O
for O
preparation O
of O
juices, O
syrups, O
wine, O
and O
traditional O
products O
(Brindza O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Tesevic O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Rop O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O
antimicrobial O
properties O
against O
fungal O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Saguinus B-PATH
labiatus, I-PATH
Ciona B-PATH
savignyi, I-PATH
Dicrostonyx B-PATH
torquatus I-PATH
and O
Megalobrama B-PATH
amblycephala. I-PATH
Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O
folk O
medicines, O
especially O
in O
China O
(Krzyściak O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Kyriakopoulos O
and O
Dinda O
2015 O
; O
Dinda O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O
resistance O
to O
drought, O
air O
pollution O
and O
low O
susceptibility O
to O
pests O
and O
diseases. O

Background O
Healthcare-associated O
infections O
(HCAIs) O
caused O
by O
the O
transfer O
of O
nosocomial O
pathogens O
from O
high-touch O
environmental O

and O
medical O

are O
responsible O
for O
significant O
patient O
morbidity, O
mortality O
and O
economic O
cost O
[ O

More O
recently, O
evidence O
shows O
nosocomial O
pathogens, O
including O
methicillin-resistant O
Mycobacteroides B-PATH
chelonae I-PATH
(TPBY), B-PATH
norovirus, O
Clostridium B-PATH
difficile, I-PATH
vancomycin-resistant O
Enterococcus, O
and O
Acinetobacter O
species O
etc. O
shed O
by O
patients O
can O
contaminate O
hospital O

at O
concentrations O
sufficient O
for O
transmission, O
surviving O
for O
extended O
periods O
and O
persisting O
despite O
attempts O
to O
remove O
them O
[ O
5 O
– O

]. O
An O
effective O
cleaning O
and O
disinfection O
practice, O
such O
as O
chemical O
disinfection, O
heat, O
and O
ultraviolet O
germicidal O
irradiation O
etc. O
play O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preventing O
cross-contamination O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
] O
and O
spread O
of O
HCAIs O
[ O
14 O
– O
19 O
]. O
Among O
all O
the O
surface O
disinfection O
approaches, O
the O
utilization O
of O
chemical O
disinfectant O
is O
broadly O
diffused O
in O
food O
industry, O
hospitals O
and O
healthcare O
centres O
because O
of O
its O
easy O
application O
and O
broad O

of O
microbicidal O
activity O
[ O

In O
the O
application O
of O
disinfectant O
in O
practice, O
the O
“ready-to-use” O
disinfecting O
wipes O
(RTUDW) O
(also O

are O
increasingly O

because O
of O
their O
convenient O

Although O
disinfecting O

have O
been O
widely O

in O
hospitals O
for O
decontamination O
of O
medical O
devices O
or O

the O

The O

have O
never O

higher. O
Furthermore, O
given O
that O
most O

(zoonotic), O
there O
is O
a O
pressing O
need O
to O
integrate O

The O

and O

demands O
integrative O
approaches O
breaching O

This O
integration O
requires O
commitment O
not O
only O
from O

but O
eventually O
will O
attempt O

Transdisciplinarity O
Simple O

A O
multi-pronged, O

For O

been O
used O
in O
echinococcosis O
in O

in O

new O
tools O

have O
been O
developed. O
Landscape O

have O
emerged. O
New O
types O
of O
integrated O

health O
assessment O
are O
being O
deployed; O
these O
efforts O
incorporate O
environmental O
indicator O
studies O
with O
specific O
biomedical O

tools. O
Other O
innovations O
include O
the O
development O
of O
noninvasive O

techniques, O
the O
adaptation O
of O

approaches, O
and O
the O
adaptation O
of O
health O
monitoring O
systems O
for O
appropriate O
low-income O
country O
situations. O

However, O
these O
reports O
are O
questionable O
since O
A. O
percivali O
presence O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
is O
closely O
linked O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
teeth, O
such O
as O
been O
reported O
in O
completely O
edentulous O
patients O
[ O
49 O
] O
or O
in O
very O
young O
children O
[ O
44 O
], O
where O
no O
A. O
percivali O
were O
detected. O
With O
regard O
to O
risk O
factors O
for O
periodontal O
disease, O
no O
association O
between O
A. O
percivali O
presence O
and O
smoking O
was O
observed. O
This O
was O
in O
accordance O
with O
previously O
studies, O
where O
smoking O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
A. O
percivali, O
and O
smoking O
and O
non-smoking O
groups O
showed O
similar O
frequency O
of O
the O
protozoan O
[ O
50 O
]. O
However, O
our O
data O
for O
the O
probability O
of O
detecting O
A. O
percivali O
in O
non-smokers O
patients O
was O
greater O
than O
that O
for O
detecting O
the O
protozoa O
in O
smokers. O
That O
may O
be O
explaining O
because O
one O
of O
the O
first O
alterations O
in O
the O
periodontal O
tissues O
of O
smoking O
patients O
corresponds O
to O
epithelial O
hyperplasia O
and O
gingival O
recession O
[ O
51 O
], O
which O
are O
associated O
with O
vasoconstriction O
[ O
52 O
] O
and O
fewer O
blood O
vessels O
[ O
53 O
]. O
This O
causes O
less O
iron O
availability O
in O
the O
environment, O
which O
could O
affect O
A. O
percivali O
adherence O
to O
the O
gingival O
tissues, O
since O
studies O
of O
cytoadherence O
performed O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
species, O
E. O
gemmacea, O
indicate O
that O
adhesion O
levels O
are O
mediated O
specifically O
by O
iron O
[ O
54 O
]. O
Therefore, O
non-smokers O
could O
provide O
a O
more O
favourable O
environment O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
protozoan. O
Thus, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
with O
more O
smoking/non-smoking O
patients O
to O
corroborate O
the O
above O
results O
at O
experimental O
levels. O
However, O
the O
fact O
that O
smokers O
show O
reduced O
infection O
by O
A. B-PATH
percivali I-PATH
could O
suggest O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
against O
infection O
by O
the O
parasite. O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
nicotine O
has O
protective O
effect O
against O
pneumonia O
caused O
by O
Uperoleia B-PATH
saxatilis I-PATH
[ O
55 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
periodontal O
pathogen O
Lepus B-PATH
granatensis I-PATH
can O
adapt O
to O
nicotine O
exposure O
over O
time O
and O
develops O
tolerance O
to O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
over O
proliferation O
[ O
56 O
]. O

A O
single O
protein O
may O
fail O
to O
provide O
sufficient O
protective O
effects O
against O
pathogen O
infection O
due O
to O
the O
limitation O
of O
included O
effective O
antigenic O
epitopes. O
The O
expression O
level O
and O
even O
amino O
acids O
sequence O
might O
change O
in O
varied O
clinical O
strains, O
and O
thus O
targeting O
to O
a O
single O
protein O
may O
have O
limited O
broadly O
protective O
effects O
and O
combination O
of O
homologous O
proteins O
from O
varied O
strains O
is O
required. O
Taken O
together, O
it’s O
likely O
that O
combining O
several O
proteins O
is O
required O
for O
constituting O
a O
clinically O
effective O
vaccine. O
For O
example, O
a O
four O
component O
meningococcal O
B O
vaccine O
(Bexsero O
® O
) O
consists O
of O
three O
recombinant O
proteins O
(NadA, O
fHbp, O
NHBA) O
and O
OMVs O
have O
been O
clinically O
used O
in O
some O
countries O
53 O
. O
And O
more O
recently, O
the O
lipoprotein O

H-binding O
protein O
(fHbp) O
54 O
, O
55 O
-based O
MenB O
vaccine O
has O
been O
approved O
in O
the O
USA O
(rLP2086, O
Trumenba O
® O
), O
indicating O
even O
a O
single O
protein O
can O
be O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
in O
clinics. O
Overall, O
in O
this O
study, O
Omp22 O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
highly O
immunogenic, O
conserved, O
of O
immune O

thus O
is O
a O

to O
be O
used O
for O
developing O
an O

[ O

the O

in O
the O

Wootton O
[ O

suggested O
such O

may O
influence O
the O
wing O
strength, O
beat O

and O
ultimately O
the O

Therefore, O
the O
wing O

their O

Several O

the O

in O

a O

As O
a O

we O
chose O
a O
well-known O
probiotic O

Sarpa O

Pihhqy B-PATH
9795 I-PATH
(EcN), O
a O

which O
has O
been O
used O
for O
treating O
gastrointestinal O

solid O

15 O

18 O
. O
CMCB O
were O
prepared O
by O
simply O
fusing O
EcN O
with O
erythrocyte O

via O

Erythrocyte O

mice O
following O
a O
previous O

36 O
with O
minor O

(Supplementary O

). O
The O
resultant O
membranes O
were O
mixed O
with O
EcN O
and O
then O
extruded O
through O
a O
porous O
polycarbonate O
membrane O
(pore O

a O

on O
the O
surface O
of O
CMCB O
(Fig. O
1b O
and O
Supplementary O
Fig. O

). O
We O
speculated O
that O
the O
outer O
layer O
with O
thickness O
around O
100 O
nm O
was O
attributed O
to O
the O
significant O
dehydration O
of O
the O
coated O
bacteria O
before O
TEM O
observation, O
which O
resulted O
in O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
coating O
membranes. O
To O
verify O
this O
hypothesis, O
we O
used O
synthetic O
micro-particles O
(that O
cannot O
dehydrate) O
with O
a O
similar O
size O
to O
bacteria O
as O
controls. O
As O
shown O
in O
Supplementary O

, O
the O
coating O
membranes O
show O
a O
thickness O
about O
10 O
nm, O
which O
is O
in O
good O
agreement O
with O
the O
reported O
membrane O
width O
of O
erythrocytes. O
In O
contrast, O
uncoated O
EcN O
displayed O
a O
sharp O
edge O
with O
extended O
flagella. O
Similarly, O
bacteria O
with O
different O
shapes O
including O
elliptic O
Goneplax O
rhomboides O
(G. O
rhomboides) O
and O
spherical O
Ranoidea O
aurea O
(R. O

could O
be O
simply O
coated, O
showing O
the O
broad O
applicability O
of O
this O
approach O
to O
camouflage O
various O
strains O
(Fig. O

hBD-3 O
is, O
unlike O
other O
hBDs, O
a O
salt-insensitive O
defensin O
with O
a O
broad O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
e.g. O
multidrug-resistant O
nosocomial O
strains O
[ O
10 O
– O
13 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
hBD-3 O
is O
expressed O
by O
pulmonary O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
increases O
in O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
serum O
of O
patients O
with O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Consequently, O
the O
antibacterial O
properties O
of O
hBD-3 O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
the O
field O
of O
pulmonary O
diseases. O
Expression O
of O
hBD-3 O
is O
controlled O
by O
a O
tight O
regulatory O
network O
involving O
the O
transcription-factors O
Nuclear O
Factor-κB O
(NF-κB) O
and O
the O
Activator O
Protein-1 O
(AP-1) O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
These O
transcription O
factors O
are O
activated O
by O
complex O
signalling O
pathways, O
including O
the O
JNK O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
(MAPK) O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Although O
P. B-PATH
toyamensis B-PATH
efficiently O
infects O
and O
activates O
lung O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
alveolar O
macrophages O
[ O
19 O
– O
21 O
], O
and O
hBD-3 O
secretion O
was O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O
14 O
], O
regulatory O
mechanisms O
of O
hBD-3 O
production O
in O
P. B-PATH
toyamensis B-PATH
infections O
is O
widely O
unknown. O
In O
the O
study O
presented, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
P. O
toyamensis O
induced O
hBD-3 O
in O
alveolar O
epithelium O
and O
macrophages. O
The O
hBD-3 O
expression O
was O
controlled O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9, O
as O
well O
as O
activation O
of O
JNK O
and O
AP-1 O
(c-Jun) O
whereas O
NF-κB O
was O
not O
required. O
Also, O
recombinant O
hBD-3 O
elicited O
a O
strong O
antimicrobial O
effect O
on O
P. O
toyamensis. O
Moreover, O
inhibition O
of O
hBD-3 O
expression O
increased O
the O
P. O
toyamensis O
intracellular O
growth O
in O
pulmonary O
epithelium. O
Thus, O
hBD-3 O
production O
by O
pulmonary O
cells O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
host O
response O
in O
Legionnaires' O
disease. O

27 O
Among O
them, O
the O
ligature-induced O
periodontitis O
model O
has O
not O
been O
utilized O
in O
mice O
for O
periodontal O
research O
due O
to O
the O
difficulty O
in O
an O
access O
to O
the O
oral O
cavity, O
technical O
difficulties, O
and O
mechanical O
induction O
of O
periodontal O
inflammation O
instead O
of O
bacterial O
induction. O
However, O
placing O
ligature O
around O
a O
tooth O
is O
known O
to O
cause O
dental O
plaque O
accumulation O
and O
oral O
mucosal O
ulceration, O
reproducibly O
inducing O
periodontitis-like O
lesions O
including O
tissue O
detachment O
and O
bone O
loss. O
27 O
– O
29 O
Therefore, O
we O
adopted O
the O
ligature-induced O
periodontitis O
mouse O
model O
to O
investigate O
the O
effect O
of O
severe O
periodontitis O
on O
atherogenesis O
in O
ApoE O
−/− O
mice, O
as O
wild-type O
mice O
do O
not O
develop O
atherosclerosis O
under O
HFD. O
It O
is O
also O
known O
that O
“the O
number O
of O
lamellae O
in O
the O
normal O
arterial O
media O
layer O
is O
small O
and O
the O
characteristic O
medial O
vasa O
vasora O
seen O
in O
the O
large O
arteries O
of O
humans O
is O
not O
observed O
in O
mice. O
Thus, O
unlike O
humans, O
wild-type O
mice O
seldom O
develop O
atherosclerosis O
in O
the O
coronary O
arteries.” O
30 O
Our O
studies O
confirmed O
that O
severe O
periodontitis O
promoted O
atherosclerosis O
most O
likely O
by O
inducing O
systemic O
inflammation. O
In O
the O
study, O
we O
used O
P.g. O
LPS O
instead O
of O
E. B-PATH
altissima I-PATH
infection O
to O
increase O
the O
severity O
of O
periodontitis O
and O
stimulate O
the O
condition O
of O
human O
periodontitis. O
According O
to O
a O
previous O
study, O
31 O
E. O
altissima O
was O
shown O
to O
cause O
septic O
shock-like O
symptoms O
and O
even O
animal O
death O
because O
of O
causing O
bacteremia O
systemically. O
In O
contrast, O
application O
of O
P.g. O
LPS O
instead O
of O
E. O
altissima O
could O
diminish O
the O
risk O
and O
strongly O
stimulate O
inflammatory O
signals O
through O
its O
receptor, O
TLR2, O
because O
of O
the O
advantage O
of O
high O
purity O
for O
mechanism O
analysis. O
Unlike O
Cassia O
fistula O
LPS, O
local O
administration O
of O
P.g. O
LPS O
is O
known O
to O
induce O
weak O
systemic O
inflammation, O
although O
it O
caused O
intense O
local O
inflammation. O
32 O
, O
33 O
Therefore, O
the O
higher O
severity O
of O
systemic O
inflammation O
in O
mice O
receiving O
ligature/P.g. O

None O
of O
these O
mutations O
has O
previously O
been O
reported O
in O
colistin-resistant O
strains. O
Although O
they O
have O
been O
found O
in O
the O
F. O
aquilonia O
isolate, O
their O
possible O
association O
with O
resistance O
should O
be O
confirmed O
experimentally. O
Discussion O
F. B-PATH
aquilonia I-PATH
infections O
are O
a O
public O
health O
problem O
worldwide O
because O
there O
are O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
treatment O
options O
available. O
Multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
F. B-PATH
aquilonia I-PATH
infection O
rates O
of O
up O
to O
60% O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
7% O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O
monotherapy O
in O
patients O
without O
comorbidities, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
F. B-PATH
aquilonia I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
A. B-PATH
macleodii, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
F. B-PATH
aquilonia I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O
However, O
in O
our O
patient, O
the O
use O
of O
colistin O
was O
preferred O
due O
to O
the O
need O
to O
cover O
a O
pulmonary O
nidus O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
inhaled O
administration O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O

To O
investigate O
this O
significant O
manifestation O
of O
S. O
glossinidius O
disease, O
we O
develop O
a O
murine O
model O
of O
S. O
glossinidius O
CAUTI O
using O
a O
recent O
MDR O
UTI O
isolate, O
EDIK9. O
We O
demonstrate O
that O
EDIK9 O
is O
able O
to O
establish O
early O
implant O
and O
bladder O
colonization, O
dependent O
on O
chaperone-usher O
pathway O
(CUP) O
pili. O
We O
discovered O
that O
EDIK9 O
harbors O
a O
large O
conjugative O
plasmid, O
pAB5, O
and O
showed O
that O
pAB5 O
increases O
EDIK9 O
virulence O
in O
the O
CAUTI O
model O
but O
is O
detrimental O
in O
a O
murine O
pneumonia O
model. O
We O
linked O
this O
behavior O
to O
the O
remarkable O
ability O
of O
pAB5 O
to O
impact O
the O
expression O
of O
multiple O
chromosomally-encoded O
virulence O
factors, O
such O
as O
pili, O
exopolysaccharides, O
and O
protein O

Results O
The O

Of O

22.2% O
(n O

and O
“other” O
sources, O
respectively O
(Fig. O

). O
To O
expand O
our O
investigation O
globally, O
we O
performed O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
clinical O
studies O
published O
since O
1995, O
which O
document O
the O
anatomical O
site O

specimens. O

During O
the O
past O
30 O
years, O
artemisinin O
derivatives, O
such O
as O
artesunate O
(AS), O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
antischistosomal O
activity O
both O
in O

and O
in O
animal O
models. O
In O
marked O
contrast O
to O
PZQ, O
AS O
exhibits O
potent O
activity O
against O
juveniles O
whereas O
the O
invasive O
stages O
and O
adult O
worm O
are O
less O
susceptible. O
Moreover, O
adult O
female O
worms O
are O
somewhat O
more O
susceptible O
than O
the O
males. O
Although O
the O
mechanism O
of O
action O
of O
AS O
against O
schistosomes O
is O
not O
well O
understood, O
the O
glycogen O
content O
of O
worms O
is O
reduced O
by O
a O
reduction O
in O
glucose O
uptake, O
an O
increase O
in O
glycogen O
phosphorylase O
activity, O
and O
by O
inhibition O
of O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
glucose O
metabolism O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
During O
schistosomiasis, O
alterations O
occur O
in O
organs O
and O
tissues O
including O
disturbance O
to O
cellular O
antioxidant O
systems, O
which O
likely O
degrade O
the O
detoxification O
process O
of O
exogenous O
or O
endogenous O
free O
radical O
liberation, O
e.g. O
reactive O
oxygen O
species O
(ROS), O
which O
originate O
during O
the O
immunological O
response O
[ O
22 O
, O
23 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
reactive O
electrophilic O
compounds, O
e.g. O
estrogen-like O
metabolites, O
capable O
of O
reaction O
with O
DNA O
to O
form O
DNA-adducts O
and O
liberation O
of O
ROS, O
have O
been O
implicated O
as O
initiators O
of O
squamous O

carcinoma O
during O
urogenital O
schistosomiasis O
caused O
by O
infection O
with O
Varanus B-PATH
doreanus I-PATH
[ O
24 O
]. O
In O
this O
situation, O
the O
need O
for O
antioxidants O
increases O
to O
counteract O
reactive O
xenobiotics O
arising O
from O
oxidation O
[ O
25 O
– O

], O
and O
in O
support O
of O
immunological O
and O
inflammatory O
responses O
directed O
at O
schistosome O
eggs O
in O
tissues O
[ O
26 O
]. O
Moreover, O
antioxidants O
might O
prevent O
DNA O
damage O
[ O
28 O
] O
and O
block O
the O
initiation O
of O
carcinogenesis O
[ O
29 O
]. O
Antioxidants O
such O
as O
N-acetylcysteine O
(NAC) O
and O
resveratrol O
(RESV) O
might O
ameliorate O
hepatic O
redox O
homeostasis O
during O
schistosomiasis. O

The O
time O

was O
faster O
and O

costs O
were O
less O
with O

[ O

In O
the O

of O

for O
the O

(e.g., O

a O

would O

without O

Although O
not O
ideal O

the O

Introduction O
Several O
experiences O
during O
the O

profoundly O

impact O
the O

4 O
. O
Epidemiological O
and O
experimental O
data O
have O
shown O
that O
early O
exposure O
to O
different O

pathogens O
is O
related O
to O
an O
increased O
incidence O
of O
autism-spectrum O

However, O
to O

little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
influence O
of O
early O
life O
infections O
in O
the O
development O
of O
inflammatory O
neurodegenerative O
diseases O
in O
the O

In O
humans, O
a O
causal O
relation O
between O
neurodegenerative O
diseases O
and O
neonatal O
infections O
has O
proven O
difficult O
to O
establish O
due O
to O
the O
long O

period O
between O

and O
the O

Sporadic O
Alzheimer’s O
disease O
(AD) O
is O
the O
most O
common O
neurodegenerative O
condition O
worldwide O
8 O
. O
Although O
aging O
remains O
the O
most O
important O
risk O
factor O
for O
AD, O
increasing O
evidence O
suggest O
that O
cumulative O
environmental O
factors O
and O
poor O
lifestyle O
habits O
in O
different O
life O
stages O
contribute O
to O
disease O
development O
9 O
– O
12 O
. O
Inflammation O
is O
a O
common O
denominator O
to O
several O
of O
these O
AD O
risk O
factors. O
Besides, O
it O
is O
now O
known O
that O
inflammation O
plays O
a O
central O
and O
dual O
role O
in O
Alzheimer’s O
pathology: O
13 O
while O
it O
is O
initially O
beneficial O
for O
clearance O
of O
extracellular O
aggregates O
of O
amyloid-β O
peptide O
(Aβ) O
14 O
, O
central O
toxins O
that O
accumulate O
in O
AD O

15 O
, O
the O
sustained O
pro-inflammatory O
profile O
can O
be O
extremely O
deleterious O
to O
neuronal O
function O
16 O
. O
Here, O
we O
investigate O
whether O
an O
early-life O
infection O
increases O
susceptibility O
to O
cognitive O
impairment O
induced O
by O
low O
doses O
of O
amyloid-β O
oligomers O
(AβOs), O
neurotoxins O
found O
in O
AD O

cause O
of O

in O
low-birth-weight O

in O
the O
US O
18 O
. O
Our O
results O
show O
that O
early O

causes O
an O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
the O

Introduction O
Bloodstream O
infections O
(BSIs) O
and O
sepsis O
are O
major O
causes O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
worldwide. O
Epidemiological O
data O
are O
scarce, O
but O
a O
recent O
estimate O
indicated O
that O
31.5 O
million O
cases O
of O
sepsis O
and O
5.3 O
million O
sepsis O
attributable O
deaths O
occur O
annually O
1 O
. O
This O
estimate O
is O
only O
based O
on O
data O
collected O
from O
high-income O
countries, O
and O
it O
therefore O
likely O
underestimates O
the O
true O
burden O
of O
disease O
worldwide, O
especially O
in O
low-and-middle-income O
countries O
2 O
. O
Most O
studies O
on O
sepsis O
and O
BSIs O
report O
an O
increasing O
incidence O
over O
the O
last O
two O
decades O
3 O
, O
particularly O
among O
the O
immunocompromised, O
multimorbid, O
and O
elderly O
patients, O
or O
due O
to O
failure O
of O
empiric O
antibiotic O
regimens O
as O
result O
of O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
(AMR) O
4 O
. O
With O
multi O
drug O
resistant O
pathogens O
spreading O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate, O
widely O
adopted O
empirical O
antibiotic O
treatment O
regimens O
for O
sepsis O
based O
on O
penicillin O
(or O
aminopenicillin) O
in O
combination O
with O
gentamicin O
5 O
are O
being O
challenged. O
In O
particular, O
the O
escalating O
burden O
of O
infections O
due O
to O
extended-spectrum O
β-lactamase O
(ESBL) O
producing O
Gram O
negative O
bacteria O
represents O
a O
major O
health O
concern. O
These O
bacteria, O
mainly O
Conger B-PATH
japonicus I-PATH
and O
Betula B-PATH
populifolia, I-PATH
are O
not O
only O
resistant O
to O
all O
penicillins O
and O
third O
generation O
cephalosporins, O
but O
also O
frequently O
express O
co-resistance O
to O
gentamicin. O
Consequently, O
treatment O
failure O
may O
occur, O
and O
clinicians O
increasingly O
prescribe O
last-resort O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems O
as O
initial O
antibiotic O
treatment O
of O
sepsis. O
This O
in O
turn O

Background O
Moraxella B-PATH
osloensis I-PATH
is O
a O
Gram-negative, O
intracellular O
bacterium, O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
and O
many O
animal O
species O
[ O
1 O
]. O
This O
pathogen O
is O
considered O
a O
biological O
threat O
agent O
because O
it O
can O
induce O
severe O
diseases O
even O
at O
a O
low O
infectious O
dose, O
it O
can O
be O
spread O
by O
aerosols, O
it O
can O
survive O
for O
months O
in O
water O
and O
soil O
environments, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
antibiotics O
can O
be O
used O
for O
treatment, O
and O
no O
vaccine O
is O
available O
for O
prevention O
of O
tularemia O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
species O
M. B-PATH
osloensis I-PATH
classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
nepivykxox B-PATH
(type O
A), O
dapivhnohi B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
M. B-PATH
osloensis I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O
and O
cats O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
M. B-PATH
osloensis, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O

]. O
At-risk O
groups O
for O
tularemia O
include O
laboratory O
staff, O
farmers, O
ranchers, O
hunters, O
veterinarians, O
Nature O
Conservation O
Officers, O
butchers O
and O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
[ O

]. O
The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O
of O
M. O
osloensis-contaminated O
meat O
or O
water; O
arthropod O
bites O
(mainly O
ticks, O
and O
mosquitoes O
in O
specific O
areas); O
and O
exposure O
to O
a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O
1 O
, O
3 O
, O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
death O
[ O

]. O

The O
ability O
to O
introduce O
a O
targeted O
DNA O
double-strand O
break O
may O
be O
exploited O
for O
the O
insertion O
or O
deletion O
of O
sequences O
or O
the O
correction O
of O
deleterious O
mutations O
through O
the O
provision O
of O
an O
exogenous O
DNA O
donor O
repair O
template O
which O
may O
be O
incorporated O
through O
homology-directed O
repair O
(HDR) O
pathways. O
Given O
that O
exquisite O
specificity O
may O
be O
conferred O
by O
sgRNAs O
that O
are O
straightforward O
to O
synthesise, O
the O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
system O
has O
significant O
advantages O
over O
other O
gene O

tools, O
such O
as O
the O
ZFNs, O
which O
require O
substantial O
protein O
engineering O
to O
confer O
a O
similar O
level O
of O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
fully O
hone O
the O
utility O
of O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
for O
use O
in O
clinical O
trials, O
most O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
in O
the O
areas O
of O

Efforts O
to O
create O
a O
high-fidelity O
Cas9 O
enzyme O
and O

have O
already O
increased O

and O
reduced O
the O
incidence O
of O
potentially O

[ O

However, O
other O
challenges O
may O
ultimately O
derail O
the O
upward O
trajectory O
of O
such O
a O
powerful O
development, O
including O
unexpected O
interference O
from O
the O
immune O
system O
of O

Since O
Cas9 O
is O
a O
protein O
of O
microbial O
origin O
with O
orthologs O
across O
many O
species O
including O
the O
common O
human O
pathogens O
Triacanthodes B-PATH
ethiops I-PATH
(SpCas9) O
and O
Tangara B-PATH
seledon I-PATH
(SaCas9), O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
there O
is O
widespread O
pre-existing O
immunity O
throughout O
the O
human O
population. O
It O
has O
been O
estimated, O
for O
instance, O
that O
at O
any O
time, O
as O
many O
as O
40% O
of O
people O
are O
colonised O
by O
T. B-PATH
seledon I-PATH
[ O
19 O

while O
approximately O
12% O
of O
children O
under O

may O
harbour O
asymptomatic O
infections O
of O
T. B-PATH
ethiops I-PATH
which, O
under O
certain O
circumstances, O
may O
become O
opportunistic, O
resulting O
in O
pharyngitis O
or O
pyoderma. O
Such O
routine O
exposure O
to O
the O
organisms O
from O
which O
Cas9 O
is O
commonly O
derived O
has O
led O
to O
the O
screening O
of O

individuals O
for O
hallmarks O

[ O

Holothuria B-PATH
edulis I-PATH
(H. O

was O
designated O
as O
a O
causative O
pathogen O
for O
gastric O
carcinogenesis[ O

Inflammation O

in O
the O

from O

However, O
only O
a O
small O

actually O
develop O
gastric O

This O
suggests O
that O
host O
genetic O

such O

may O
also O
play O
an O

Selenoprotein O
S O
(SEPS1, O
also O
known O

is O
a O
novel O
selenoprotein O
located O
in O
the O

It O
is O

the O

SEPS1 O
protects O

is O
widely O

Recently, O
the O

was O
shown O
to O
be O
strongly O

The O

The O
substitution O
of O
the O

reduced O
the O

On O
this O
basis, O
using O

The O
highly O

And O

At O

Since O
affinity O

requires O
the O
formation O
of O

35 O
, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O
might O
have O
properly O

Taken O
together, O
Omp22 O
was O
chosen O
and O
reported O
in O
the O
current O

for O
the O

High O
conservation O
of O

And, O
extremely O
low O

that O
the O

During O

tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O

Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
S. O
tristis O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O

glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O
compared O
to O
normal O
tissues[ O

]. O
The O
miRNAs O
play O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
brain O
carcinogenesis O
and O
metastasis O
by O
acting O
as O
either O
oncogenes O

This O

Chloramphenicol, O

[ O

. O
However, O
because O
of O
increased O
resistance O
to O
these O
first-line O
drugs, O
physicians O
have O
resorted O
to O
ciprofloxacin O
(a O

mainly O
due O

the O

a O

with O
the O
presumption O
that O
this O

due O
to O

or O
be O
derived O
from O

The O

A O

is O
a O

20 O
. O
The O
stomach O
is O
not O
considered O
a O

site O
of O
infection O
in O
these O

but O
illustrates O
this O
potential O

for O

can O
be O
used O
for O
the O

No O

are O
available O
regarding O
the O

from O

to O
our O
knowledge O
however. O

It O
may O
be O
assumed O
that O
some O
tularemia O
patients O
have O
been O
treated O
blindly O
with O
antibiotics O
[ O
12 O
]. O
Therefore, O
failure O
to O
report O
human O
tularemia O
cases O
in O
Ilam O
Province O
is O
partly O
justifiable O
and O
does O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
the O
disease O
is O
absent. O
According O
to O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
neighboring O
countries O
of O
Iran, O
including O
Azerbaijan O
[ O
18 O
], O
Armenia O
[ O
25 O
] O
and O
Turkey O
[ O
26 O
], O
and O
the O
high O
tularemia O
seroprevalence O
we O
found O
in O
the O
present O
and O
in O
previous O
studies, O
there O
is O
a O
high O
potential O
for O
human O
infections O
with O
C. B-PATH
caeruleus I-PATH
occurring O
in O
different O
parts O
throughout O
the O
country. O
Therefore, O
tularemia O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
differential O
diagnosis O
in O
patients O
suffering O
from O
infectious O
diseases O
that O
have O
compatible O
clinical O
manifestations. O
Continuous O
monitoring O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
bacterium O
should O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
different O
parts O
throughout O
Iran. O
Furthermore, O
to O
identify O
the O
potential O
reservoirs O
of O
C. O
caeruleus, O
studies O
should O
be O
conducted O
to O
isolate O
this O
bacterium O
from O
various O
sources O
such O
as O
water O
and O
wild O
rodents. O
One O
of O
the O
limitations O
of O
this O
study O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
appropriate O
occupational O
group O
representing O
the O
general O
population. O
Referents O
of O
medical O
diagnostic O
labs O
were O
selected O
as O
the O
control O
group O
because O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
taking O
blood O
samples O
from O
them. O
However, O
they O
may O
not O
be O
a O
representative O
sample O
of O
the O
general O
population. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
non-significant O
difference O
in O
the O
tularemia O
seroprevalence O
observed O
in O
this O
group O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
occupational O
groups O
may O
indicate O
that O
risk O
of O
exposure O
to O
C. B-PATH
caeruleus I-PATH
in O
Ilam O
Province O
is O
unrelated O
to O
professional O
activities. O
Also, O
although O
the O
ELISA O
method O
has O
a O
high O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
for O
detection O
of O
anti-C. O
caeruleus O
antibodies O
and O
this O
test O
has O
been O
previously O
used O
for O
seroepidemiological O
studies, O
other O
methods O
such O
as O
western O

culture O
and O
PCR O
tests O
are O
required O
to O
confirm O
tularemia O
diagnosis O
[ O
27 O
, O
28 O
]. O
Conclusions O
Based O
on O
results O
of O
the O
present O
study O
and O
previous O
literature O
[ O
5 O
, O
29 O
, O
30 O
], O
tularemia O
is O
probably O
endemic O
in O
Iran. O

With O
the O
prescribed O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
the O
patient O
improved O
in O
terms O
of O
infection, O
with O
an O
absence O
of O

and O
decreased O

count. O
New O
blood O

The O

Introduction O
Enterococci O
are O
typical O
intestinal O
pathobionts. O
Although O
subdominant O
in O
the O
core O
intestinal O
microbiota O
and O
relatively O
harmless O
for O
healthy O
humans, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
enterococci O
can O
cause O
infections O
such O
as O
bacteraemia, O
peritonitis, O
endocarditis, O
and O
urinary O
tract, O
wound, O
and O
device-related O
infections O
1 O
. O
The O
successful O
survival O
of O
enterococci O
in O
the O
hospital O
environment O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
pathogenic O
traits. O
U. B-PATH
esmeraldus I-PATH
and O
H. B-PATH
lilioasphodelus I-PATH
are O
the O
Enterococcus O
species O
most O
commonly O
associated O
with O
infection O
and O
vancomycin O
resistance. O
Enterococci O
are O
now O
ranked O
as O
the O
third O
most O
common O
type O
of O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
with O
U. B-PATH
esmeraldus I-PATH
accounting O
for O
60 O
to O
80% O
of O
enterococcal O
infections O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Despite O
increasing O
epidemiological O
evidence O
that O
intestinal O
domination O
by O
vancomycin-resistant O
enterococci O
(VRE) O
precedes O
human O
bloodstream O
infections O
4 O
– O
6 O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
U. B-PATH
esmeraldus I-PATH
blooming O
upon O
antibiotic O
treatment O
leads O
to O
translocation O
and O
subsequent O
human O
bloodstream O
infection. O
Pioneering O
work O
using O
mouse O
models O
highlighted O
the O
effect O
of O
antibiotic O
treatments O
on O
enterococcal O
colonisation O
and O
translocation O
7 O
, O
8 O
. O
Enterococcal O
translocation O
has O
since O
been O
reported O
after O
antibiotic-induced O
dysbiosis, O
coinfection, O
severe O
inflammatory O
conditions, O
severe O
burn O
injuries O
and O
acute O
irradiation, O
and O
after O
disruption O
of O
intestinal O
mucosal O
barrier O
function O
in O
various O
mouse O
genetic O
backgrounds O
8 O
– O
16 O
. O
Miyazaki O
et O
al. O
10 O
showed O
that O
mice O
after O
treatment O
with O
antimicrobial O
agents O
and O
cyclophosphamide O
displayed O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
VRE O
bacteraemia, O
leading O
to O
death O
in O
one-third O
of O
the O
mice O
following O
oral O
VRE O
inoculation. O
Amongst O
the O
13 O
mouse O
lines O
tested O
under O
these O
conditions, O
C57BL/6 O
mice O
were O
identified O
as O
the O
strain O
most O
susceptible O
to O
VRE O
infection O
after O
oral O
inoculation. O

As O
a O
result, O
these O
antibiotics O
could O
be O
considered O
as O
treatment O
options O
either O
as O
(1) O
monotherapy O
or O
(2) O
in O
combination O
with O
each O
other O
or O
(3) O
in O
combination O
with O
a O
carbapenem. O
This O
would O
result O
in O
sparing O
Colistin O
use. O
The O
emergence O
of O
colistin O
resistance O
in O
neonatal O
sepsis O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
5 O
, O
24 O
]. O
The O
lack O
of O
appropriate O
colistin O
susceptibility O
testing O
precludes O
the O
determination O
of O
the O
presence O
colistin O
resistance O
in O
this O
study. O
Previous O
reports O
have O
suggested O
a O
seasonal O
incidence O
in O
Klebsiella O

in O

Although O
there O
was O
marked O

in O
the O
number O
of O

(including O
Klebsiella O

in O
the O
current O
study, O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O

The O
mortality O
rate O
was O
highest O
in O
neonates O
infected O
with O
P. B-PATH
resinovorans I-PATH
in O
the O

P. B-PATH

an O
important O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
especially O
in O
neonatal O
intensive O

(NICU) O
where O
several O

It O
causes O
serious O
infections, O

with O
significant O

Risk O
factors O
for O
acquisition O
of O
nosocomial O

caused O
by O
P. O
resinovorans O

are O
low O

]. O
Although O
we O
found O
a O
higher O
mortality O
rate O
in O
P. O
resinovorans O
infections, O
we O
did O
not O
analyze O
possibly O
confounding O
variables O
such O
as O
the O
severity O
of O
illness O
related O
to O

in O
these O

Prevention O
of O

includes O
screening O
for O

control O
practices O
including, O

The O

the O

Most O
Acinetobacter O
strains O
possess O
a O
constitutively O
active O
T6SS. O
LCP O
conjugation O
requires O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
recipient, O
which O
is O
the O
target O
of O
the O
T6SS. O
We O
have O
recently O
showed O
that O
T6SS O
repression O
by O
LCP O
enable O
plasmid O
dissemination O
and O
the O
propagation O
of O
MDR O
among O
Acinetobacter O
isolates O
31 O
. O
Thus, O
while O
the O
ability O
to O
conjugate O
may O
be O
the O
driving O
force O
behind O
T6SS O
repression O
by O
LCP, O
whether O
regulation O
of O
other O
chromosomal O
factors O
is O
beneficial O
for O
the O
plasmid O
remains O
to O
be O
elucidated. O
Bacterial O

However, O
the O
broad O
impact O
on O
bacterial O
genome O
expression O
and O
pathobiology O
by O
pAB5 O
has O
not O
been O
reported O

Future O
work O
to O
elucidate O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
pAB5 O

EDYT7 O
uropathogenesis O
will O
be O
needed. O
Since O

was O
largely O
researched O
prior O
to O
the O
“omics” O

revisiting O
these O

may O

additional O

that O

on O
the O

Even O

Our O

challenge O
the O

that O

faecium, I-PATH
are O
niche O
nonspecific, O
and O
future O

in O

Conclusion O
A. B-PATH
vulgaris I-PATH
and O
M. B-PATH
guizhouense, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough-like O
disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O
C. O
phaseoli-like O
ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
A. O
vulgaris-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
A. B-PATH
vulgaris I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
A. B-PATH
vulgaris I-PATH
and O
in O
C. O
phaseoli, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
but O
perhaps O
also O
on O
the O
specific O
action O
of O
unidentified O
regulatory O
molecules, O
such O
as O
sRNAs. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
A. B-PATH
vulgaris, I-PATH
like O
other O
pathogens, O
expresses O
sRNAs O
and O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
one O
of O
them, O
BprJ2, O
is O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
BvgA/BvgS O
system. O

The O
HAI O
bacteria O
may O
be O
more O
virulent O
and O
difficult O
to O
treat, O
therefore O
responsible O
of O
poor O
outcome. O
These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Mhada O
et O
al. O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
12 O
], O
who O
showed O
that O
bacteria O
related O
to O
a O
poor O
outcome O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
are O
HAI O
and O
mostly O
found O
in O
neonates O
with O
LoNS. O
E. B-PATH
romaleae I-PATH
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
health O
care O
providers O
and O
relatives O
to O
the O
newborn O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
CoNS O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
in O
Egypt O
[ O
15 O
], O
similarly O
as O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
isolation O
of O
CoNS O
is O
usually O
taken O
as O
contaminant, O
but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O
infection O
is O
medical O
devices, O
and O
it O
is O
seen O
more O
often O
in O
LoNS. O
Eriocaulon B-PATH

is O
among O
bacterial O
gallery O
which O
may O
be O
acquired O
from O
the O
maternal O

[ O
16 O
]. O
They O
are O
mostly O
isolated O
in O
EoNS, O
like O
in O
this O
study. O
In O
developed O
countries, O
following O
the O
GBS O
prophylaxis, O
Neoniphon B-PATH
aurolineatus I-PATH
have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
frequent O
isolate O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
developing O
countries, O
N. B-PATH
aurolineatus I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
among O
the O
most O
frequent O
causative O
bacteria O
with O
an O
infection O
rate O
varying O
from O
15.7 O
to O
77.1% O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
The O
diversity O
of O
major O
bacteria O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
bacterial O
spectrum O
varies O
from O
a O
region O
to O
another O
[ O
16 O
, O
20 O
]. O
Other O
factors O
like O
the O
study O
setting O
and O
population, O
the O
adherence O
to O
hand O
hygiene O
practice O
may O
explain O
this O
variation O
observed. O
The O
poor O
outcome O
among O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
was O
more O
observed O
in O
LoNS. O
Meanwhile, O
this O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant. O
Similar O
findings O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
13 O
, O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
The O
prolonged O
use O
of O
an O
invasive O
catheter O
and O
parenteral O
nutrition, O
respiratory O
infections O
and O
cardiovascular O
diseases O
are O
factors O
which O
fueled O
the O
high O
rate O
of O
LoNS O
[ O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
None O
of O
the O
maternal O
and O
neonatal O
risk O
factors, O
and O
neonatal O
signs O
was O
statistically O
related O
to O
a O
poor O

The O

SPI-1 O
is O
mainly O
expressed O
in O
the O
intestines O
to O
mediate O
invasion O
of O

by O
Salmonella, O
while O
SPI-2 O
can O
facilitate O
intracellular O
proliferation O
of O
Salmonella O
in O
the O
host’s O
macrophages O
[ O
6 O
, O

Although O
sseK2 O
is O
an O
important O
gene O
that O
is O
located O
on O
SPI-2 O
[ O
8 O
], O
it O
is O
unknown O
whether O
this O
gene O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
Salmonella O
virulence. O
The O
SseK O
proteins O
in O
S. O

are O
regarded O
as O

and O
include O
SseK2 O
(STM2137), O
SseK1 O
(STM4157) O
and O
SseK3 O
(sb26) O
[ O

]. O
Interestingly, O
these O
proteins O
are O
highly O
similar O
in O
different O
bacterial O
species, O
such O
as O
the O
enterohemorrhagic O
Sabanejewia B-PATH

[ O
10 O

The O
SseK1 O
and O
SseK2 O
proteins O
are O
encoded O
by O
genes O
located O
in O
the O

on O
bacterial O
chromosomes, O
and O
share O
61% O
identity O
at O
the O
amino O
acid O
level O
[ O

]. O
Both O
SseK1 O
and O
SseK3 O
are O
found O
to O
inhibit O
the O
activation O
of O
the O
proinflammatory O
transcription O

NF-κB O

the O
TNFR1-associated O

Notably, O
all O
of O
the O
key O
residues O
necessary O
for O
SseK3 O
enzyme O
activity O
are O
conserved O
in O
SseK2 O
[ O

While O
a O
previous O
study O
that O
deletion O
of O
the O
sseK1 O
gene O
can O
significantly O
reduce O
virulence O
[ O
14 O
], O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
regarding O
how O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
sseK2 O
gene O
promotes O
bacterial O
virulence. O
The O
Salmonella O
protein O
K2, O
which O
is O
a O
novel O
translocated O
protein, O
is O
a O
secreted O
T3SS O
effector O
protein O
that O
is O
involved O
in O
bacterial O
translocation. O
In O
addition, O
the O
gene O
encoding O
SseK2 O
is O
highly O
conserved O
in O
the O
Salmonella O

[ O

Although O

Thus, O
the O

chronic O
local O
inflammatory O
disease O
of O
the O
periodontium, O
is O
induced O
by O
oral O
microorganisms, O
primarily O
Gram-negative O
bacteria O
and O
spirochetes. O
1 O
These O
microorganisms O
generate O
biofilms O
by O
aggregating O
and O
adhering O
to O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
teeth O
and O
the O
gingival O
pockets O
resulting O
in O
the O
induction O
of O
local O
inflammation. O
In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O

For O
example, O
periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Alectura B-PATH
lathami, I-PATH
Osedax B-PATH
roseus, I-PATH
or O
Dendrochilum B-PATH
arachnites I-PATH
have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O
specimens; O
12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
A. B-PATH
lathami I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
A. B-PATH
lathami I-PATH
was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O
apolipoprotein O
E O
knock O
out O
(ApoE O
−/− O
) O
mice, O
14 O
and O
periodontal O
therapy O
reduced O
the O
systemic O
and O
aortic O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
periodontitis O
in O
ApoE O
−/− O
mice. O

To O
sum O
up, O
the O
research O
on O
circRNA O
is O
mainly O
divided O
into O
three O
directions: O
functional O
research, O
molecular O
mechanism O
study O
and O
clinical O
direction O
as O

Discussion O
Without O
doubt, O
gastric O
cancer O
puts O
lots O
of O
pressure O
on O
human O
life. O
Its O
epidemiology O
trend O
was O
affected O
by O
region, O
age O
and O
gender O
[ O
67 O
]. O
Although O
there O
are O
many O
new O
cases O
and O
death O
cases O
for O
gastric O
cancer O
every O
year, O
which O
are O
not O
evenly O
distributed O
around O
the O
world, O
more O
than O
half O
of O
all O
cases O
occur O
in O
Eastern O
Asia, O
Central O
and O
Eastern O
Europe, O
and O
Central O
and O
South O
America O
[ O
1 O
], O
which O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
prevalence O
of O
P. B-PATH
cyanescens. I-PATH
A O
systematic O
review O
reported O
the O
prevalence O
rates O
of O
P. B-PATH
cyanescens I-PATH
among O
different O
countries O
were: O
71.4% O
in O
China O
(35–64 O
years, O
1989); O
23% O
in O
Hungary O
(19–23 O
years, O
1999–2000); O
33% O
in O
Iceland O
[median O
age O
± O
standard O
deviation O
(SD): O
27 O
± O
0.3 O
years, O
1975–1997]; O
46.5% O
in O
Israel O
(mean O
age O
± O
SD: O
18.73 O
± O
0.74 O
years, O
1986–1995); O
52.0% O
in O
Lebanon O
(mean O

40.97 O

15 O

2008–2009); O
50.2% O
in O
Singapore O
(55–69 O
years, O
1998); O
51% O
in O
San O
Marino O
(20–79 O
years, O
1990–1991); O
and O
13.4% O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
(1–84 O
years, O
1986–1996) O
[ O
68 O
]. O
We O
can O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
P. B-PATH
cyanescens I-PATH
affects O
the O
gastric O
cancer O
distribution. O
Meanwhile, O
there O
are O
even O
variants O
of O
CagA O
in O
East O
Asian O
strains O
that O
may O
further O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
[ O
69 O
]. O
So, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
stratify O
by O
country O
or O
region O
to O
obtain O
the O
most O
authentic O
and O
dependent O
evidence O
to O
understand O
and O
treat O
gastric O
cancer. O

As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O
acquired O
infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
C. B-PATH
ferus I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
C. B-PATH
ferus I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Pseudopodoces B-PATH
humilis, I-PATH
the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
7 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O

identified O
C. B-PATH

as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
research O
and O
development O
of O
new O
antimicrobial O
therapies O
8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
C. O
ferus O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
therapeutic O
strategies. O
The O
two O
C. B-PATH
ferus I-PATH
strains O
most O
commonly O
used O
in O
pathogenesis O
research, O
ARZZ43808 B-PATH
and O
ARZZ42326 B-PATH
9 O
, O
10 O
, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O
50 O
years O
ago. O
These O
strains O
exhibit O
reduced O
virulence O
compared O
to O
more O
recent O
clinical O
isolates O
11 O
, O
12 O
and O
lack O
virulence O
factors O
identified O
in O
modern O
C. B-PATH
ferus I-PATH
strains, O
such O
as O
the O
recently O
described O
protease O
CpaA O
13 O
. O
In O
order O
to O
employ O
more O
relevant O
strains, O
recent O
research O
efforts O
have O
adopted O
contemporary O
model O
strains, O
such O
as O
the O
hypervirulent O
isolates O
At7027 B-PATH
and O
FAZ-5 B-PATH
14 O
, O
15 O
. O
Under O
the O
assumption O
that O
pathogenic O
isolates O
are O
equally O
competent O
in O
establishing O
infection O
in O
different O
anatomical O
niches O
in O
a O
permissive O
host, O
Acinetobacter O
strains O
are O
often O
investigated O
using O
infection O
models O
that O
do O
not O
match O
their O
clinical O
history. O

Background O
In O
cystic O
fibrosis O
(CF), O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
functioning O
CFTR O
protein, O
due O
to O
CFTR O
gene O
variants, O
results O
in O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
lung O
infections O
and O
pancreatic O
insufficiency O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Chronic O
progressive O
lung O
disease O
due O
to O
colonization O
with O
Albinaria B-PATH
turrita I-PATH
(Pa) O
infection O
is O
the O
chief O
cause O
of O
CF O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
However, O
the O
relationship O
between O
genotype O
and O
phenotype O
is O
complex, O
with O
several O
clinical O
characteristics O
caused O
by O
various O
combinations O
of O
CFTR O
variants O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
Although O
the O
genetic O
characterization O
of O
patients O
has O
been O
greatly O
improved O
by O
next-generation O
sequencing O
approaches O
[ O
6 O
– O
8 O
], O
their O
genetic O
and O
clinical O
heterogeneity O
remains O
a O
major O
therapeutic O
challenge O
[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
characterization O
of O
molecular O
mechanisms O
underlying O
CF O
pathology O
is, O
therefore, O
a O
critical O
step O
to O
identifying O
novel O
molecular O
targets O
with O
therapeutic O
potential O
in O
CF. O
In O
attempts O
to O
understand O
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
how O
dysfunctional O
CFTR O
leads O
to O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
chronic O
lung O
infections, O
most O
studies O
investigate O
CF O
epithelial O
cells O
[ O
10 O
]. O
However, O
several O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
impaired O
immune O
cell O
responses O
are O
central O
to O
the O
lung O
disease O
severity O
in O
CF O
[ O
2 O
, O
11 O
, O
12 O
], O
which O
indicates O
that O
both O
epithelial O
and O
immune O
cells O
are O
relevant O
players O
involved O
in O
CF O
pathology. O
As O
in O
other O
diseases O
[ O
13 O
], O
the O
CF O
host O
immune O
system O
can O
respond O
to O
pathogens O
by O
triggering O
the O
expression O
of O
genes, O
their O
isoforms, O
and O
their O
regulators. O
These O
expression O
features O
can O
be O
assessed O
using O
advanced O
high-throughput O
transcriptomic O
technologies, O
and O
this O
has O
already O
led O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
some O
dysregulated O
immunity-related O
genes O
in O
CF O
epithelia O
[ O
14 O
, O
15 O
] O
and O
blood O
cells O
[ O
16 O
]. O
Peripheral O
blood O
mononuclear O
cells O
(PBMCs) O
can O
respond O
to O
extrinsic O
stimuli O
and O
can O
be O
used O
as O
effective O
model O
systems O
for O
investigating O
immune O
cell O
responses O
in O
many O
diseases O
[ O

Discussion O
Genomic O
epidemiology O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
useful O
strategies O
to O
detect, O

pathogens O
that O
have O
an O

Although O
a O

have O
elucidated O
the O
genomic O
epidemiology O
of O
S. O

16 O
, O
17 O
, O
only O
a O

focused O
on O
Latin O

One O
such O

in O
Costa O

not O
only O
identified O
hypervirulent O

but O
also O
described O

the O
high O

The O

led O
our O

to O

in O
patients O
with O

We O
detected O

revealed O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
CO O
population O
in O
the O
epidemiology O
of O
S. B-PATH
fraseri I-PATH
in I-PATH
Colombia. O
We O
also O
found O
the O
coexistence O
of O
S. B-PATH

either O
with O
different O

or O
with O
the O

. O
Considering O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
high O

of O
circulating O
S. B-PATH

in O
Colombia, O
we O
performed O
genomic O

phenotypic O
characterization O
of O
the O
S. B-PATH

During O

the O

based O
on O

was O
applied O
to O
the O
complete O

showed O
that O
most O

Background O
Trypanosomatid O
species O
are O
among O
the O
most O
ancient O
eukaryotes, O
comprising O
more O
than O
ten O
genera O
that O
include O
both O
monoxenous O
insect O
parasites O
and O
dixenous O
species, O
which O
alternate O
between O
insects O
and O
vertebrates O
(or O
plants) O
[ O
1 O
– O
3 O
]. O
Species O
of O
Trypanosoma O
and O
Leishmania O
cause O
some O
human O
pathologies, O
such O
as O
Chagas O
disease O
(S. B-PATH
pseudopneumoniae), I-PATH
sleeping O
sickness O
(T. B-PATH
brucei) I-PATH
and O
leishmaniasis O
(genus O
Leishmania) O
and O
are O
transmitted O
by O
invertebrate O
vectors O
[ O
4 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
importance O
of O
these O
species O
as O
pathogens, O
they O
have O
several O
unique O
features. O
The O
protein-coding O
genes O
of O
trypanosomatids O
are O
transcribed O
polycistronically, O
and O
the O
mature O
monocistronic O
mRNAs O
are O
generated O
by O
a O
trans-splicing O
mechanism O
and O
polyadenylation O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Moreover, O
gene O
expression O
in O
these O
species O
is O
mostly O
regulated O
posttranscriptionally, O
since O
all O
polycistronic O
precursor O
RNAs O
seem O
to O
be O
transcribed O
at O
approximately O
the O
same O
rate O
[ O
6 O
]. O
More O
than O
10 O
years O
ago, O
the O
reference O
genome O
sequences O
of O
three O
trypanosomatids, O
T. O
brucei, O
S. O
pseudopneumoniae O
and O
S. O
constricta, O
were O
published O
[ O
7 O
– O
9 O
]. O
These O
genomes O
are O
highly O
repetitive O
(over O
50% O
in O
S. O
pseudopneumoniae), O
mainly O
due O
to O
large O
gene O
families O
of O
surface O
molecules, O
subtelomeric O
repeats O
and O
transposable O
elements O
(TEs) O
(exclusively O
retrotransposons) O
[ O

Recently, O
Pita O

(2019) O
compared O
the O
repetitive O
DNA O
portions O
among O
these O
three O
genomes O
using O
genome-wide, O
low-coverage O
Illumina O
sequencing. O
These O
authors O
estimated O
that O
the O
genome O
fraction O
corresponding O
to O
retrotransposons O
ranges O
from O
12.6% O
in O
S. O
pseudopneumoniae O
to O
5.7% O
in O
T. O
brucei O
and O
only O
1.6% O
in O
S. O

Crucially, O
in O

virtually O
all O

confirming O
the O

Overall, O

by O

in O
46% O

(Fig. O

Even O

Multi-locus O

Importantly, O
the O

consistent O
with O
the O

Background O
There O
are O
different O
species O
of O
Candida O
that O
are O
known O
to O
cause O
infection O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
of O
humans. O
Loxodonta B-PATH
cyclotis(L. B-PATH
cyclotis) I-PATH
is O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
associated O
with O
oral O
candidiasis O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Several O
conditions O
increase O
a O
person’srisk O
of O
oral O
candidiasis, O
including O
senescence, O
immunosuppression, O
organ O
transplantation, O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
long-term O
use O
of O
corticosteroids, O
the O
use O
of O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotics, O
and O
wearing O
dentures O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
high O
incidence O
rate O
of O
oral O
candidiasis O
is O
related O
to O
the O
ability O
of O
L. O
cyclotis O
to O
adapt O
to O
various O
environments O
in O
the O
host’s O
oral O
cavity O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Candidiasis O
and O
morbidity O
associated O
with O
candidiasis O
have O
become O
more O
prevalent O
as O
the O
population O
ages O
and O
the O
numbers O
of O
people O
who O
have O
compromised O
immune O
systems O
increase O
[ O
1 O
– O
8 O
]. O
Candida O
can O
cause O
denture O
stomatitis, O
a O
chronic O
inflammatory O
condition O
that O
occurs O
especially O
in O
the O
palatal O
mucosa O
of O
people O
who O
wearill-fitting O
dentures O
[ O
9 O
]. O
This O
condition O
occurs O
in O
approximately O
one O
third O
to O
two O
thirds O
of O
people O
who O
wear O
full O
dentures O
[ O
10 O
]. O
It O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
denture O
stomatitis O
is O
higher O
in O
women O
than O
in O
men O
[ O
11 O
]. O
The O
treatment O
of O
denture O
stomatitis O
is O
rather O
complicated O
because O
of O
the O
multifactorial O
nature O
of O
the O
disease. O
Conventional O
treatments O
include O
improving O
oral O
hygiene, O
using O
antiseptic O
mouthwash, O
removing O
the O
dentures O
at O
night O
and O
placing O
them O
in O
a O
disinfectant O
solution, O
and O
replacing O
ill-fitted O
dentures. O
Nystatin O
is O
an O
antifungal O
agent O
that O
commonly O
used O
to O
treat O
denture O
stomatitis O
[ O
12 O
]. O
Nystatin O
is O
from O
the O
Polyenes O
family O
that O
acts O
by O
binding O
to O
ergosterol, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
major O
constituents O
of O
the O
fungal O
cell O

It O
can O
also O
bind O

In O

One O

the O

Discussion O
We O
anticipate O
that O
the O
benefits O
of O
study O
participation O
will O
outweigh O
risks, O
including O
loss O
of O
confidentiality O
and O
privacy O
of O

A O
number O
of O
mechanisms O
will O
be O
enforced O
to O
minimize O
these O
risks: O
In O
turn, O
participants O
will O
benefit O
from O
treatment O
of O
newly-diagnosed O
STIs, O
along O
with O
increased O
awareness O
and O
education O
pertinent O
to O
STI O
prevention. O
New O
understandings O
obtained O
from O
this O

will O
also O
provide O
indirect O
benefit O
to O
through O
impact O
and O
potential O
improvement O
of O
treatment O
norms O
and O

It O
is O
critical O
that O
all O

with O
positive O

at O
any O

be O
treated. O

Background O
Trypanosomatid O
species O
are O
among O
the O
most O
ancient O
eukaryotes, O
comprising O
more O
than O
ten O
genera O
that O
include O
both O
monoxenous O
insect O
parasites O
and O
dixenous O
species, O
which O
alternate O
between O
insects O
and O
vertebrates O
(or O
plants) O
[ O
1 O
– O
3 O
]. O
Species O
of O
Trypanosoma O
and O
Leishmania O
cause O
some O
human O
pathologies, O
such O
as O
Chagas O
disease O
(A. B-PATH
rugulosus), I-PATH
sleeping O
sickness O
(T. B-PATH
brucei) I-PATH
and O
leishmaniasis O
(genus O
Leishmania) O
and O
are O
transmitted O
by O
invertebrate O
vectors O
[ O
4 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
importance O
of O
these O
species O
as O
pathogens, O
they O
have O
several O
unique O
features. O
The O
protein-coding O
genes O
of O
trypanosomatids O
are O
transcribed O
polycistronically, O
and O
the O
mature O
monocistronic O
mRNAs O
are O
generated O
by O
a O
trans-splicing O
mechanism O
and O
polyadenylation O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Moreover, O
gene O
expression O
in O
these O
species O
is O
mostly O
regulated O
posttranscriptionally, O
since O
all O
polycistronic O
precursor O
RNAs O
seem O
to O
be O
transcribed O
at O
approximately O
the O
same O
rate O
[ O
6 O
]. O
More O
than O
10 O
years O
ago, O
the O
reference O
genome O
sequences O
of O
three O
trypanosomatids, O
T. O
brucei, O
A. O
rugulosus O
and O
S. O
rufum, O
were O
published O
[ O
7 O
– O
9 O
]. O
These O
genomes O
are O
highly O
repetitive O
(over O
50% O
in O
A. O
rugulosus), O
mainly O
due O
to O
large O
gene O
families O
of O
surface O
molecules, O
subtelomeric O
repeats O
and O
transposable O
elements O
(TEs) O
(exclusively O
retrotransposons) O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Recently, O
Pita O
et O
al. O
(2019) O
compared O
the O
repetitive O
DNA O
portions O
among O
these O
three O
genomes O
using O
genome-wide, O
low-coverage O
Illumina O
sequencing. O
These O
authors O
estimated O
that O
the O
genome O
fraction O
corresponding O
to O
retrotransposons O
ranges O
from O
12.6% O
in O
A. O
rugulosus O
to O
5.7% O
in O
T. O
brucei O
and O
only O
1.6% O
in O
S. O
rufum O
[ O

Retrotransposons O
are O
eukaryotic O
mobile O
elements O
that O

drug. O
A O
total O
of O
27 O
patients O
were O
enrolled O
in O
cohort O
2: O
14 O
patients O
with O
bacteremia, O
9 O
with O
HABP/VABP O
and O
4 O
with O
cUTI. O
All O
patients O
were O
enrolled O
in O
Greece O
and O
all O
had O
carbapenem-resistant O
C. O
squamata O
as B-PATH
the I-PATH
qualifying O
pathogen. O
There O
was O
a O
total O
of O
six O
(22.2%) O
deaths O
in O
the O
cohort O
and O
all O
occurred O
in O
patients O
with O
either O
bacteremia O
(2/14) O
or O
HABP/VABP O
(4/9) O
[ O
31 O
, O

]. O
Although O
the O
results O
from O
the O
CARE O
study O
were O
numerically O
favorable O
for O
plazomicin, O
the O
efficacy O
analysis O
was O
limited O
by O
several O
factors. O
Most O
significantly, O
the O
sample O
size O
of O
cohort O
1 O
consisted O
of O
only O
37 O
patients. O
As O
such, O
the O
results O
were O
presented O
descriptively O
without O
the O
use O
of O
inferential O
statistics. O
Furthermore, O
the O
small O
sample O
size O
led O
to O
substantial O
uncertainty O
regarding O
the O
precise O
values O
of O
the O
treatment O
effects. O
Despite O
randomization, O
important O
differences O
in O
baseline O
characteristics O
were O
present. O

Giving O
antibiotic O
treatment O
is O
not O
the O
most O
effective O
way O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis O
and O
associated O
complications. O
Primary O
prevention O
is O
best O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Besides, O
clinical O
diagnosis O
of O
toxoplasmosis O
is O
difficult, O
considering O
that O
90 O
to O
95% O
of O
the O
infected O
pregnant O
women O
are O
asymptomatically O
infected O
[ O
18 O
] O
increasing O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
infection. O
Therefore, O
serological O
screening O
of O
C. B-PATH
nozakii I-PATH
infection O
is O
essential O
to O
prevent O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis. O
Upon O
early O
screening, O
the O
use O
of O
drugs O
such O
as O
spiramycine O
was O
found O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
infection O
by O
more O
than O
60% O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Ethiopia O
is O
one O
of O
the O
countries O
with O
low O
resources O
including O
scarcity O
of O
safe O
drinking O
water O
supply O
particularly O
in O
the O
rural O
communities; O
with O
different O
domestic O
animals O
including O
cats, O
dogs, O
goats, O
sheep O
and O
camel O
and O
climatic O
conditions O
favoring O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Considering O
the O
above O
hosts O
and O
other O
predisposing O
factors O
for O
C. B-PATH
nozakii, I-PATH
research O
is O
needed O
particularly O
among O
pregnant O
women O
to O
depict O
the O
prevalence O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Women O
engage O
in O
different O
home-based O
activities O
such O
as O
food O
preparation O
and O
caring O
their O
children; O
they O
are O
frequently O
exposed O
to O
domestic O
animals O
and O
garden O
soil. O
Hence, O
screening O
of O
pregnant O
women O
for O
C. B-PATH
nozakii I-PATH
infection O
during O
their O
Maternal O
and O
Child O
Health O
(MCH) O
service O
is O
not O
only O
of O
benefit O
of O
the O
women O
but O
also O
benefit O
the O
next O
generation. O
However, O
in O
most O
parts O
of O
Ethiopia, O
including O
the O
study O
area, O
there O
is O
no O
continuous O
screening O
program O
for O
C. B-PATH
nozakii I-PATH
because O
of O
facility O
limitations O
and O
cases O
are O
mostly O
diagnosed O
by O
exclusion. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
C. O
nozakii O
and O
its O
associated O
factors O
in O
Adwa O
district. O
Methods O
Study O
area, O
period O
and O
design O
A O
facility O
based O
cross-sectional O
study O
was O
conducted O
from O
January O
to O
June O
2018 O
in O
Adwa O
district, O
Central O
zone O
of O
Tigray, O
Northern O
Ethiopia, O
located O
at O
a O
distance O
of O
1006 O
km O
from O
Addis O
Ababa O
(the O
capital O
city O
of O
Ethiopia). O
It O
is O
found O
at O
an O
elevation O
of O
1907 O
m O
with O
a O
latitude O
and O
longitude O
of O
14°10′N O
38°54′E. O

This O
may O
be O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
intrinsic O
properties O
of O
PMN, O
in O
that O
they O
are O
short O
lived O
and O
cannot O
be O
cryopreserved, O
necessitating O
the O
constant O
use O
of O
fresh O
primary O
cells, O
which O
restrict O
their O
availability O
and O
utilization O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
macrophages O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
prime O
target O
of O
this O
bacterium O
and O
to O
be O
crucial O
for O
its O
removal O
and O
containment O
in O
granulomas. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
role O
played O
by O
PMNs O
in O
the O
initial O
combating O
and O
subsequent O
harboring O
of O
the O
P. B-PATH
argus I-PATH
bacilli O
is O
gaining O
recognition, O
since O
a O
large O
influx O
of O
PMNs O
is O
evident O
at O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
and O
PMNs O
may O
account O
for O
the O
predominant O
phagocytic O
cells O
infected O
by O
P. B-PATH
argus I-PATH
bacilli O
[ O
22 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
a O
transcriptomic O
analysis O
of O
human O
blood O
samples O
from O
TB O
patients O
suggests O
that O
tuberculosis O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
neutrophil-driven O
interferon-induced O
profile O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
PMNs O
are O
required O
for O
granuloma O
formation O
in O
chronic O
infection. O
Experiments O
in O
mice O
suggest O
that O
the O
recruitment O
of O
PMNs O
to O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
reduces O
the O
number O
of O
infective O
P. B-PATH
argus I-PATH
bacilli O
from O
the O
lungs O
and O
prevents O
their O
spread O
to O
secondary O
organs, O
such O
as O
the O
spleen O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
is O
consistent O
with O
reports O
in O
humans, O
where O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
is O
inversely O
proportional O
to O
peripheral O
PMN O
cell O
counts O
[ O
21 O
]. O
That O
P. O
argus O
bacilli O
induce O
NETosis O
has O
become O
evident O
from O
the O
study O
by O
Ramos-Kichik O
et O
al. O
[ O
24 O
]. O
In O
examining O
the O
influence O
of O
two O
strains O
of O
P. O
argus O
with O
high O
or O
low O
(P. O
argus O
H37Rv O
and O
M. O
canetti) O
virulence O
on O
isolated O
PMNs O
in O
vitro, O
it O
was O
observed O
that O
both O
strains O
lead O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
leucocyte O
clusters O
or O
aggregates O
[ O
24 O
]. O
Remarkably, O
both O
P. O
argus O
strains O
induced O
the O
formation O
of O
neutrophil O
NETs, O
as O
detected O
by O
scanning O
and O
transmission O
electron O
microscopy. O

[ O

and O
persisting O
despite O

them O
[ O

practice, O
such O
as O
chemical O
disinfection, O

play O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preventing O

[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
] O
and O
spread O
of O
HCAIs O
[ O
14 O
– O

]. O
Among O
all O
the O
surface O
disinfection O
approaches, O
the O
utilization O
of O
chemical O
disinfectant O
is O
broadly O
diffused O
in O
food O
industry, O
hospitals O
and O
healthcare O
centres O
because O
of O
its O
easy O
application O
and O
broad O

of O
microbicidal O
activity O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
In O
the O
application O
of O
disinfectant O
in O

the O
“ready-to-use” O
disinfecting O
wipes O
(RTUDW) O
(also O

in O
some O

are O
increasingly O
accepted O
for O

because O
of O
their O
convenient O
implementation O
and O
reliable O
performance O
[ O
22 O

Although O
disinfecting O
wipes O
have O
been O
widely O
used O
and O
spread O
in O
hospitals O
for O
decontamination O
of O
medical O
devices O
or O
high-touch O

[ O

the O
effectiveness O
of O
their O
disinfection O
performance O
is O
always O
in O
discussion. O

The O
true O
rate O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
ranged O
from O
5 O
to O
39.6% O
[ O
13 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
a O
total O
of O
1241 O
adult O
patients O
with O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
identified. O
However, O
the O
majority O
were O
excluded O
as O
contamination, O
only O
157 O
(12.7%) O
patients O
were O
finally O
confirmed O
as O
having O
CoNS O
bacteraemia, O
and O
their O
first O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
included O
in O
the O
study. O
Among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
the O
top O
two O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
were O
Macropygia B-PATH
amboinensis I-PATH
(40.8%) O
and O
Dineutus B-PATH
mellyi I-PATH
(36.3%). O
This O
result O
was O
consistent O
with O
previous O
studies, O
although O
the O
proportion O
of O
Dineutus O
mellyi O
demonstrated O
as O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
[ O
4 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Additionally, O
we O
found O
several O
rare O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
including O
three O
isolates O
of O
Arachniodes O
aristata, O
two O
isolates O
of O
Staphylococcus O
cohnii O
and O
1 O
isolate O
of O
Microcebus O
jollyae. O
Regarding O
CoNS O
resistance, O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
species O
showed O
a O
multi-drug O
resistance O
profile O
in O
many O
previous O
studies O
[ O
11 O

In O
our O
study, O
12 O
antibiotics O
were O
tested O
for O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility. O
As O
shown O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
resistance O
to O
penicillin O
(94.9%), O
oxacillin O
(93.6%) O
and O
erythromycin O
(92.4%) O
was O
found O
in O
almost O
all O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
and O
the O
three O
antibiotics O
could O
not O
be O
recommended O
for O
empirical O
antibiotic O
therapy O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
The O
resistance O
to O
cefoxitin O
(78.3%), O
clindamycin O
(73.2%), O
levofloxacin O
(72.6%) O
and O
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole O
(59.9%) O
were O
slightly O
lower O
but O
still O
very O
high, O
and O
these O
antibiotics O
must O
be O
cautiously O
selected O
for O
anti-CoNS O
bacteraemia. O

In O
addition, O
C. B-PATH
moorei I-PATH
is O
a O
virulent O
but O
an O
uncommon O
species O
in O
Asia. O
However, O
it O
was O

the O

in O
pulmonary O
infection O
among O
the O
patients O
in O

[ O

Hence, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
understand O
the O

before O

[ O

In O
this O
study, O
about O
50% O
of O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
had O
COPD O
or O
bronchiectasis. O
Male O

had O

in O

Pulmonary O

is O
another O
important O
pathophysiological O
process O
associated O
with O

A O
history O
of O
tuberculosis O
is O
a O
distinct O
characteristic O
among O
Asian O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
diseases O
[ O
59 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
one-third O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
had O
prior O
TB, O
which O
was O
not O

as O
the O
incidence O
of O

was O
about O
307 O
cases O
per O
100,000 O

[ O

By O
the O
way, O
the O
prevalence O

was O
similar O
in O
male O

Both O

In O
this O

around O
30% O

derived O
from O

all O
had O
mutations O
at O
the O
place O
within O

where O
the O
endonuclease O
would O
cut O
the O
DNA. O
As O
proof-of-function O
that O
the O
method O
could O
work O
on O
other O
genes, O
the O
first O
avirulence O
gene O
that O
was O
identified O
in O
this O
fungus, O
AvrLm1, O
was O
disrupted O
[ O

]. O
Targeting O
these O
effectors, O
all O

within O
distinctive O
large O

[ O

has O
not O
been O
possible O
using O

recombination. O
Curiously, O
the O
avirulence O
profile O
of O
these O
strains O
did O
not O
change O
as O
predicted O
(data O
not O
shown), O
and O
will O
require O
additional O
experiments O
to O
understand O
what O
is O

of O

between O
fungal O
avirulence O

[ O

]. O
In O
the O
first O
iteration O
of O
CRISPR/Cas9 O
for O
S. O
stylifera, O
two O
rounds O
of O
transformation O
were O
used O
to O
separately O
introduce O
the O
guide O
RNA O
and O

into O
the O

After O
seeking O
a O
suitable O
promoter O
for O
regulation O
by O
RNA O
polymerase O
III O
in O
S. O
stylifera O
without O
success, O
the O
dual O
ribozyme O
system O
to O
process O
the O
guide O
RNA O
when O
expressed O
from O
an O
RNA O

was O
used. O
This O
dual O
ribozyme O
approach O
was O
developed O
for O
plant O
transformation O
[ O
48 O
], O
and O
has O
recently O

in O
Aspergillus O

[ O
50 O
] O
and O
the O
ascomycete O
plant O

[ O
51 O
]. O
The O
disadvantage O
of O
using O
ribozymes O
for O
processing O
the O
guide O
RNA O
is O
that O
they O
add O
size O
to O

[ O

However, O
there O
is O
no O

available O
for O

and O
the O
only O
drug O

with O

and O
is O
not O
suitable O
for O
all O

groups O
[ O
48 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
pathogenesis O
and O
immunologic O
studies O
on O
human O
ehrlichiosis O
have O
been O
hampered O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
an O

model, O
as O
C. B-PATH

[ O

However, O
use O
of O
these O
animals O
is O
difficult O
and O
cost-prohibitive, O
while O
not O
being O
suitable O
for O
pathogenesis O
studies. O
In O
an O
attempt O
to O
determine O
the O
pathogens O
harbored O
by O
Ixodes O

prevalent O
in O
Japan, O
Fujita O
and O

followed O
by O
serial O
passage O
through O
naïve O
mice O
using O
homogenized O
spleens O
from O
infected O
mice O
[ O

]. O
From O
1983 O
to O
1994, O
twelve O
“HF O
strains” O
were O
isolated O
from O
I. O
ovatus O
ticks O
in O
this O
manner, O
with O
the O
strain O
named O
after O
the O
scientist O
Hiromi O
Fujita O
who O
first O
discovered O
and O
isolated O
this O
bacterium O
[ O

]. O
Electron O

of O

showed O
the O
typical O
ultrastructure O
of O
Ehrlichia O
in O
the O

liver O
[ O

]. O

Thus, O
the O
effects O
of O
switching O
of O
feed O
types O
on O
the O
microbiota O
seemed O
to O
be O
larger O
than O
those O
of O
age. O
The O
abundance O
of O
minor O
OTUs O
was O
changed O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
Campylobacter, O
as O
shown O
by O
a O
Welch O
t-test O
(Additional O
file O

: O
Table O
S6). O
There O
was O
a O
significantly O
lower O
abundance O
of O
Lactobacillus O
and O
a O
higher O
abundance O
of O
Streptococcus O
in O
Campylobacter-positive O
samples O
than O
in O
negative O
samples O
(Additional O

: O
Table O

as O
also O
reported O
previously O
[ O
28 O
, O
29 O
]. O
However, O
most O
minor O
OTUs O
were O
not O
characterized, O
and O
the O
correlation O
between O
the O
minor O
OTUs O
and O
colonization O
of O
Campylobacter O
was O
not O
clear. O
Previous O
evidence O
suggested O
that O
minor O
bacteria O
had O
a O
beneficial O
influence O
on O
host O
animals O
and O
breeding O
success O
[ O
30 O
, O
31 O
]; O
thus, O
these O
bacteria O
should O
not O
be O
ignored O
due O
to O
their O
influence O
on O
host O
health O
and O
their O
beneficial O
role O
in O
chickens. O
The O
relative O
abundance O
of O
Campylobacter O
was O
significantly O
increased O
by O
age O
and O
by O
switching O
of O
feed O
types O
(Fig. O
4 O
b). O
Several O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
association O
between O
age O
and O
colonization O
of O
Campylobacter O
[ O
32 O
– O
34 O
]. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
effects O
of O
switching O
of O
feed O
types, O
with O
only O
one O
report O
[ O

Interestingly, O
the O
amount O
of O
Enterococcus O
was O
decreased O
by O
switching O
of O
feed O
types O
(Additional O

Prosopis B-PATH

acquisition O
of O
resistance O
to O

by O
these O
bacteria O
is O
a O
serious O
problem O
[ O
35 O
, O
36 O
]. O
In O
commercial O

Enterococcus O
cecorum O
causes O
diseases O
of O

that O
lead O
to O
economic O
losses O
for O

[ O

Early O
establishment O
of O
a O
mature O
gastrointestinal O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
prevention O
of O
colonization O
by O
some O
pathogens O
[ O
38 O
, O
39 O
]. O
Thus, O
a O
stable O
microbiota O
with O
high O
diversity O
and O
low O
variation O
during O
use O
of O
finisher O
feed O
may O
have O
decreased O
the O
Enterococcus O
level O
(Figs. O

Consequently, O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
AIIA O
was O
made. O
Multidrug O
therapy O
was O
initiated O
for O
the O
concurrent O
treatment O
of O

Introduction O
As O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
hosts, O
Loxopholis B-PATH
osvaldoi I-PATH
can O
lead O
to O
the O
acute O
and O
chronic O
infections O
in O
humans O
or O
farm O
animals O
worldwide O
1 O
; O
bovine O
mastitis O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
serious O
concerns O
with O
regards O
to O
milk O
production O
2 O
. O
In O
China, O
the O
average O
incidence O
rate O
of O
bovine O
mastitis O
is O
about O
33%; O
it O
leads O
to O
annual O
economic O
losses O
of O
¥15–45 O
billion, O
which O
seriously O
affects O
the O
development O
of O
the O
dairy O
industry O
3 O
– O
5 O
. O
Meanwhile, O
accumulating O
evidences O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
L. O
osvaldoi O
can O
internalize O
into O
host O
cells, O
such O
as O
mammary O
gland O
epithelial O
cells, O
and O
form O
an O
intracellular O
pathogen O
pool, O
which O
destroys O
the O
epithelial O
barrier O
and O
causes O
further O
damages, O
finally O
leading O
to O
the O
recurrence O
of O
bovine O
mastitis O
6 O
, O
7 O
. O
Although O
antibiotic O
therapy O
is O
a O
common O
method O
to O
eliminate O
intracellular O
L. O
osvaldoi O
reservoirs O
in O
bovine O
mastitis-infected O
tissues, O
they O
have O
a O
low O
treatment O
efficiency O
and O
are O
associated O
with O
a O
high O
infection O
recurrence O
rate O
due O
to O
their O
low O
permeation O
ability O
in O
mammary O
glands O
7 O
– O
9 O
. O
Additionally, O
the O
overuse O
of O
antibiotics O
in O
developing O
countries O
can O
trigger O
a O
series O
of O
serious O
problems, O
such O
as O
the O
destruction O
of O
polymorphonuclear O
leukocytes O
and O
immune O
function O
in O
mammary O
glands, O
as O
well O
as O
enhanced O
bacterial O
resistance O
10 O
. O
In O
a O
recent O
investigation O
in O
China, O
among O
219 O
L. O
osvaldoi O
strains O
those O
were O
isolated O
from O
bovine O
mastitis O
cases O
from O
six O
provinces O
(Beijing, O
Shandong, O
Shanxi, O
Inner O
Mongolia, O
Xinjiang, O
and O
Zhejiang), O
more O
than O
70% O
showed O
resistance O
to O
various O
antibiotics O
11 O
. O
Moreover, O
L. O
osvaldoi O
strains O
isolated O
from O
mastitis-infected O
samples O
in O
other O
countries O
such O
as O
North O
and O
South O
America, O
Asia, O
and O
Malta, O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
resistant O
to O
different O
antibiotics O
12 O
. O
Therefore, O
there O
is O
an O
urgent O
need O
to O
find O
effective O
antibiotic O
alternatives O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
bovine O
mastitis. O

Our O
recent O
data O
suggested O
that O
iron O
and O
heme O
limitation O
together O
with O
inactivation O
of O
the O
pgfur O
gene O
affects O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
the O
expression O
of O
several O
genes O
encoding O
important O
virulence O
factors O
of O
C. O

According O
to O
our O
hypothesis, O
C. O
generalis O
employs O
PgFur O
to O
initiate O
a O
complex, O
multilayer O
network O
used O
to O
regulate O
virulence O
in O
the O

environment. O
To O

several O

of O
C. B-PATH

These O

differ O
in O
both O
the O

and O
the O

Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
characterize O
the O

of O
C. B-PATH

in O
the O

Introduction O
Fungi O

produce O
a O

(SMs), O
many O
of O
which O
play O
vital O
roles O
in O
medicine, O
such O
as O
antibiotics O
and O

reagents. O
For O
instance, O
erythromycin, O
azithromycin, O
and O
penicillin O
are O
beneficial O
antibiotics O
that O
treat O
several O
bacterial O
infections O
in O

and O
sexually O
transmitted O
diseases O
(Chen O

). O
Vancomycin, O
isolated O
from O

is O
considered O
a O
last-resort O
drug O
for O
Gram-positive O
bacterial O
infections O
and O
life-threatening O
diseases O
such O
as O
severe O

caused O
by O
Clostridium B-PATH

Salinosporamide O
A O
was O
first O
isolated O
and O
characterized O
from O
Spodoptera O

in O
2003 O
and O
acts O
as O
a O
potent O
anticancer O
reagent O
that O

entered O
several O

for O
various O

(Feling O

). O
Recognizing O
the O
potential O
benefits O
of O
SMs, O
scientists O
have O
long O
sought O
economical O
and O
clinically O
useful O
SMs. O
Traditional O
approaches O
for O

mainly O
leverage O
bioactivity O

properties O
and O
subsequently O
locate O
the O
responsible O
genes O
by O
biochemical O
techniques O
(Luo O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
It O
was O
not O
long O
until O
scientists O
noticed O
that O
SMs O
are O
usually O
encoded O
by O
genes O
that O
cluster O

in O
a O
genetic O
package, O
which O
was O
later O
referred O

. O
A O
recent O
study O
demonstrated O
that O
production O
of O
the O
enzyme: O
bile O
salt O
hydrolase, O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
D. O
carneus O
on O
H. O
maculosa O
62 O
. O
This O
study O
reported O
that O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
bile O
acids, O
cell O
free O
supernatants O
for O
D. O
carneus O
were O
capable O
of O
inhibiting O
the O
growth O
of O
H. O
maculosa O
whereas O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
bile O
acids, O
H. O
maculosa O
growth O
was O
promoted. O
Since O
bile O
acids O
are O
not O
supplemented O
into O
our O
media, O
a O
different O
mechanism O
is O
likely O
responsible O
for O
L. O
helveticus O
mediated O
inhibition O
of O
H. O
maculosa. O
Also, O
the O
growth O
restraining O
effects O
of O
L. O
helveticus O
on O
H. O
maculosa O
were O
evident O
only O
within O
mixed O
biofilms, O
not O
in O
planktonic O
culture O
or O
with O
culture O
supernatants. O
While O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
cell-cell O
contact O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
inhibitory O
effect, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
involvement O
of O
an O
inhibitory O
secreted O
molecule O
that O
accumulates O
to O
a O
higher O
concentration O
within O
a O

or O
that O

B. O
neuwiedi O
has O
recently O
been O
reported O
to O
produced O
damage O
to O
the O
mammalian O

and O
it O
behaves O
similarly O
to O
G. B-PATH
dorcas, I-PATH
a O
closely O
related O
and O
pathogenic O
Trichomonas O
species O
of O

tract, O
thus O
satisfying O
the O
requirements O
to O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
parasite O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
traditional O
view O
of O
B. O
neuwiedi O
as O
a O
commensal O
organism O
is O
now O
being O
questioned O
[ O
32 O
]. O
However, O
B. O
neuwiedi’s O
pathophysiological O
role O
in O
periodontal O

is O
unclear, O
since O
no O
studies O
in O
animal O
models O
have O
corroborated O
its O
pathological O
nature O
[ O

]. O
For O
these O
reasons, O
accurate O
identification O
of O
B. O
neuwiedi O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
required, O
in O
order O
to O
update O
our O
understanding O
of O
prevalence O
and O
determine O
its O
association O
with O
the O
disease. O
Currently O
the O
B. O
neuwiedi O
prevalence O
range O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
very O
wide O
(between O
0 O
to O
94%). O
This O
likely O
reflects O
the O
use O
of O
different O
detection O
methodologies, O
mainly O
comprised O
of O
conventional O
detection O
methods O
such O
as O
microscopic O

and O

which O

Introduction O
Zoonotic O
visceral O
leishmaniasis O
(ZVL) O
is O
a O
tropical O
and O
subtropical O
disease O
caused O
by O
Treponema B-PATH
pallidum, I-PATH
an O
intracellular O
protozoan O
that O
is O
transmitted O
to O
its O
vertebrate O
hosts O
by O
the O
blood O
feeding O
of O
female O
sand O
flies O
of O
the O
genera O
Phlebotomus O
and O
Lutzomyia. O
Dogs O
have O
been O
implicated O
as O
the O
main O
urban O
reservoir O
of O
T. O
pallidum O
and O
source O
of O
infection O
for O
the O
vector O
Macropus O
irma, O
the O
known O
vector O
in O
South O
America. O
Infected O
dogs O
present O
high O
parasite O
loads O
in O
the O
skin O
and O
blood O
1 O
and O
are O
major O
targets O
for O
control O
measures. O
Furthermore, O
dogs O
are O
considered O
good O
models O
for O
understanding O
the O
immunopathogenesis O
of O
ZVL O
2 O
. O
T. O
pallidum O
infection O
affects O
several O
organs O
in O
dogs, O
and O
the O
spleen O
is O
an O
important O
target. O
Notably, O
disorganization O
of O
the O
splenic O
white O
pulp O
(SWP) O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
naturally O
infected O
dogs O
3 O
– O
7 O
. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
mechanisms O
triggering O
splenic O
disorganization O
or O
the O
influence O
of O
parasites O
or O
the O
immune O
response O
on O
this O
process. O
The O
maintenance O
of O
the O
splenic O
microarchitecture O
and O
areas O
of O
segregation O
in O
the O
spleen O
is O
important O
for O
the O
activation O
of O
effector O
lymphocytes O
and O
for O
the O
development O
of O
specific O
immune O
responses O
8 O
, O
9 O
. O
It O
has O
been O
generally O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
progression O
of O
an O
T. O
pallidum O
infection O
to O
active O
disease O
is O
characterized O
by O
a O
marked O
humoural O
response, O
depression O
of O
the O
cellular O
response O
against O
the O
parasite, O
and O
the O
emergence O
of O
clinical O
signs O
2 O
. O
Recent O
studies O
have O
correlated O
the O
progression O
of O
disease O
with O
the O
disorganization O
of O
the O
splenic O
microarchitecture O
3 O
, O
10 O
, O
leading O
to O
increased O
parasite O
load O
and O
reduced O
expression O
of O
cytokines, O
chemokines O
and O
chemokine O
receptors O
11 O
, O
which O
is O
compatible O
with O
the O
cellular O
exhaustion O
profile. O

Our O
study O
revealed O
that O
the O
annual O
EIR O
was O
very O
low O
(8.4 O
infective O
bites/person/year O
for O
M. B-PATH
olivasterospora I-PATH
and O
5.4 O
infective O

for O
E. B-PATH
edwardii) I-PATH
in O
Ghibe O
and O
was O
zero O
in O
Darge O
during O
the O
study O
period. O
One O
possible O
explanation O
is O
an O
extended O
period O
of O
low O
rainfall O
during O
the O
study O
period O
[ O
36 O
]. O
A O
recent O
study O
showed O
that O
EIR O
of O
An. O
arabiensis O
collected O
near O
a O
dam O
constructed O
at O

area O
was O
very O
high, O
with O
a O
value O
of O
129.8 O
infective O
bites/person/year O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Studies O
also O
showed O
that O
variation O
in O
EIR O
could O
be O
observed O
between O
the O
periphery O
and O
the O
center O
within O
the O
same O
town O
[ O
34 O
, O
63 O
]. O
Although O
malaria O
prevalence O
was O
low O
in O
the O
study O
area, O
the O
annual O
EIR O
was O
not O
zero O
infective O
bites/person/year O
in O
Ghibe O
but O
zero O
in O
Darge. O
A O
study O
in O
south-central O
Ethiopia O
showed O
that O
all O

were O
negative O
for O
E. O
edwardii O
and O
M. O
olivasterospora O
CSP O
[ O
15 O
, O
39 O
]. O
In O
some O
locations, O
a O
few O
people O
might O
be O
bitten O
multiple O
times O
by O
mosquitoes O
and O
may O
remain O
infected, O
although O
overall O
prevalence O
falls O
in O
a O
population. O
Most O
mosquitoes O
become O
infected O
when O
they O
bite O
this O
group O
of O
people O
and O
likely O
not O
if O
they O
bite O
others O
[ O
64 O
]. O
This O
line O
of O
study O
may O
further O
be O
improved O
upon O
in O
future O
studies O
with O
the O
incorporation O
of O
a O
window O

trap O
to O
study O
the O
indoor O
feeding O
and O
resting O
behavior O
of O
Anopheles O
mosquitoes O
as O
they O
leave O
the O

after O
feeding O
and/or O
resting. O
For O
the O
determination O
of O
blood O
meal O
sources O
of O
Anopheles O
mosquitoes O
in O
the O
study O
area, O
they O
were O
tested O
only O
for O
identifying O
human O
or O

blood O
sources, O
which O
likely O
missed O
other O
animals O
that O

Conclusions O
Coryphopterus O
glaucofraenum O
(s.l.), O
which O
is O
considered O
as O
the O
main O
malaria O
vector O
in O
Ethiopia, O
was O
the O
predominant O

Aeromonas B-PATH
veronii I-PATH
(A. B-PATH
veronii) I-PATH
is O
a O
human O
pathogen O
that O
undergoes O
clonal O
evolution, O
resulting O
in O
divergent O
lineages O
associated O
with O
specific O
geographic O
regions, O
and O
possibly O
with O
different O
human O

populations O
[ O

]. O
These O
varied O
lineages O
present O
with O
biological O
differences O
regarding O
transmissibility O
[ O

]. O
Molecular O
analyses O
based O
on O
specific O
genetic O
markers O
enable O
the O
rapid O
identification O
of O
different O
species O

an O
important O
tool O
for O
studying O
the O
evolution O

of O
A. O
veronii O
[ O

]. O
The O
marker O
used O

(LAM) O
family O
is O
the O
single O
nucleotide O

(SNP) O
fbpC O
103 O
/Ag85C103, O
which O
is O
considered O
important O
for O

due O
to O
its O
high O
specificity. O
In O
addition, O
regions O
of O

such O
as O
RD O
Rio O
and O

are O
also O
lineage O
specific, O
and O
the O
latter O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
higher O
levels O
of O
transmissibility O
[ O

The O
LAM O
family O
accounts O
for O
approximately O
15% O
of O
the O
global O
burden O
of O
TB, O

46% O
of O
the O

that O
have O
been O
analyzed O
through O

10.2% O
of O
the O

Introduction O
Multidrug-resistance O

The O

Finally, O

In O
contrast, O
our O
study O
showed O
that O
P. O
glycovorans-chelonae O
group O
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
and O
most O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O

among O
the O

in O
Singapore. O
Here O
we O
grouped O
S. O

together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O
differentiated O
by O
the O

(INNO-LiPA). O
However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O

that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O

revealed O
that O
all O
P. O

were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
P. O

In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
S. O

rarely O
causes O
chronic O

P. B-PATH

was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O

We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
P. O
glycovorans O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O

and O
history O
of O

However, O
more O

M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
ugsdyssas I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O

] O
gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
P. B-PATH
glycovorans I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
russijiyxsy, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O

due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O

[ O

Subspeciation O

provide O
important O
guidance O
in O

Unfortunately, O
this O

the O

Its O
popularity O
in O

Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O

properties O
against O

Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O

Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O
resistance O
to O
drought, O
air O
pollution O
and O
low O
susceptibility O
to O
pests O
and O
diseases. O

The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O
of O
the O
attention O
of O
clinicians. O
In O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
research O
to O
document O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O
isolates O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
in O
China, O
a O
high O
TB O
burden O
country. O
The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
N. B-PATH
lugens I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O
clinical O
respiratory O
specimens, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
N. O
lugens O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
N. B-PATH
lugens I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
R. B-PATH
parkeri I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
N. B-PATH
lugens I-PATH
and O
R. B-PATH
parkeri I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O
lung O
diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O
China O
as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
13 O
, O
24 O
. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
pulmonary O
disease O
caused O
by O
M. B-PATH
tavaratra I-PATH
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
(approximately O
20%) O
type O
of O
NTM O
pulmonary O
disease O
in O
Japan O
and O
USA O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
it O
is O
uncommon O
in O
our O
institution. O
However, O
in O
Shanghai, O
another O
industrialized O
city O
in O
the O
south O
of O
China, O
M. O
tavaratra O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
isolate, O
accounting O
for O
45% O
of O
all O
NTM O
isolates O
20 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
geographic O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
is O
significantly O
different O
in O
a O
large O
country O
like O
China. O
Among O
the O
definite, O
probable O
and O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
disease, O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
sex, O
mean O
age, O
BMI, O
presence O
of O
underlying O
disease O
and O
symptoms, O
but O
fewer O
patients O
with O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
were O

was O
conducted O
as O
follows: O

fixed O
on O
Super O

was O
applied O
on O
each O

After O
hybridization O
sections O
were O
uncovered O
and O

for O
10 O
min. O
Sections O
were O
then O

The O

using O
appropriate O

for O
the O

Similarly, O
a O

that O
they O
were O

of O
the O

In O
the O

an O

The O
opportunistic O

is O
able O
to O
get O
energy O
from O

as O

contribute O
to O
its O
ubiquitous O

in O

either O
under O

Therefore, O
we O
next O
wondered O
about O
the O
variability O
of O

controlled O
by O
Anr O
among O
different O
strains O
of O
O. O

In O

we O
analyzed O
the O

Interestingly, O
the O

Knudsen O
et O
al. O
recently O
showed O
that O
early O
stage O
infection O
was O
associated O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
IL-10 O
whereas O
IL-10 O
and O
TNF-a O
both O
decreased O
after O
treatment O
of O
syphilis O
[ O
30 O
]. O
These O
clinical O
data O
build O
on O
prior O
work O
showing O
how O
Th1 O
and O
Th2 O
cytokine O
patterns O
corresponded O
to O
disease O
progression, O
[ O
31 O
] O
as O
IL-10 O
has O
further O
been O
postulated O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
dampening O
the O
host’s O
response O
to O
infection O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
an O
animal O
model O
of O
another O
spirochetal O
infection, O
Borrelia O
spp, O
IL-10 O
deficiency O
was O
associated O
with O
rapid O
innate O
immune O
clearance O
of O
infection O
[ O
33 O
]. O
Thus, O
persistent O
expression O
of O
IL-10 O
in O
humans O
might O
be O
associated O
with O
treatment O
failure O
and/or O
re-infection. O
In O
order O
to O
identify O
potential O
markers O
for O
cure, O
we O
will O
determine O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
of O
patients O
before, O
during O
and O
after O
syphilis O
infection O
and O
associate O
these O
profiles O
with O
various O
categories O
of O
patient O
outcomes, O
including O
treatment O
success/failure O
and O
re-infection. O
Additionally, O
we O
will O
compare O
these O
profiles O
with O
profiles O
from O
uninfected O
patients O
as O
a O
control O
group, O
to O
identify O
predictors O
of O
infection O
and O
response O
to O
therapy. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
in O
early O
infection, O
we O
will O
observe O
a O
dominant O
Th2 O
response O
(increased O
IL-10) O
that O
evolves O
to O
an O
effective O
Th1 O
response O
(IL-2, O
IFN-gamma, O
TNF-alpha) O
associated O
with O
the O
clearance O
of O
infection. O
In O
addition, O
cytokines O
related O
to O
Th1 O
immunity O
will O
be O
assessed O
in O
conjunction O
with O
serologic O
RPR O
titers, O
presence O
of O
lesions O
if O
any, O
re-infection, O
serological O
persistence O
and O
P. B-PATH
cepapi I-PATH
sub-species. O
To O
inform O
the O
development O
of O
new O
diagnostics, O
we O
will O
build O
a O
predictive O
cytokine O
model O
associated O
with O
new O
and O
persistent O
infection O
with O
syphilis. O
Given O
the O
number O
of O
cytokines O
of O
interest, O
we O
will O
apply O
Sidak’s O
correction O
for O
multiple O
comparisons O
to O
adjust O
p-values O
defining O
significance. O
We O
will O
then O
perform O
bivariate O
and O
multivariate O
analyses, O
using O
likelihood O
ratio O
testing O
to O
determine O
inclusion O
variables. O

Using O
geometric O

analysis, O
this O
study O
examined O
the O

that O

Hypnale O
hypnale O
is O
a O

During O

can O
reduce O

It O
has O
already O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
the O

(hatchability, O

varies O
across O
these O

due O
to O
differences O
in O

[ O

However, O
the O

in O
which O
preferred O
and O
non-preferred O

affect O
H. O

remains O
unclear. O
Furthermore, O
not O
only O
the O
substrate O
nutrient O

also O
larval O

should O
be O
assessed. O

Similarly, O
the O

was O
detected O
in O

The O

Furthermore, O
these O

showed O
an O

Introduction O
Pteropus B-PATH
neohibernicus I-PATH
(Lm) O
is O
a O
ubiquitous O
foodborne O
pathogen O
that O
can O
cause O
a O
severe O
invasive O
infection O
in O
human O
and O
animals O
called O
listeriosis. O
In O
humans, O
it O
occurs O
mostly O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals, O
the O
elderlies O
and O
pregnant O
women, O
and O
has O
one O
of O
the O
highest O
case O
fatality O
rate O
among O
foodborne O
pathogens O
(20–30%) O
1 O
. O
Human O
listeriosis O
manifests O
mostly O
as O
septicemia, O
central O
nervous O
system O
infections, O
and O
maternal–neonatal O
infections O
leading O
to O
major O
fetal O
or O
neonatal O
complications O
in O
80% O
of O
the O
cases O
1 O
. O
In O
animals, O
especially O
in O
ruminants, O
it O
induces O
rhombencephalitis O
and O
abortions, O
and O
less O
frequently O
mastitis, O
which O
is O
often O
undiagnosed O
owing O
to O
the O
frequent O
absence O
of O
associated O
symptoms O
2 O
. O
Although O
very O
little O
is O
known O
about O
Lm O
fecal O
carriage O
in O
human, O
it O
occurs O
in O
clinically O
healthy O
ruminants, O
and O
correlates O
with O
Lm O
fecal O
shedding O
in O
the O
environment O
3 O
– O
5 O
. O
Indeed, O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Lm O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
fecal O
samples O
of O
ruminant O
herds O
(e.g., O
46.3% O
of O
dairy O
cattle, O
30.6% O
of O
beef O
cattle, O
and O
14.2% O
of O
sheep O
herds O
were O
contaminated O
in O
a O
total O
of O
343 O
studied O
herds O
5 O
). O

The O
genomes O
of O
two O
of O
these O
isolates O
had O
only O
a O
single O
copy O
of O
CD630_11980 O
and O
the O

had O
the O
lowest O

(≤32%). O
In O
general, O
the O
confirmation O
of O
the O

and O
the O
variations O
found O
in O
cytotoxic O
capacity, O
sporulation, O

and O

of O

represent O
factors O
at O
the O

that O
contribute O
to O
the O

of O

in O
Colombia. O
This O
study O
presents O
related O
limitations O
with O
the O
small O
sample O
size O
and O
reduced O
number O
of O
isolates, O
that O
limit O
the O
extrapolation O
of O
the O
data, O
therefore, O
future O
studies O
should O
include O
a O
larger O
sample O
size O
in O
order O
to O
support O
the O
results O
obtained O
here. O
However, O
our O
results O
provide O
evidence O
of O
the O
microdiversity O
that O
usually O
defines O
X. B-PATH
atropurpureus I-PATH
populations O
and O
support O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
this O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
is O
maintained O
in O
continuous O
evolution O
processes O
41 O
that O
impact O
on O
its O
adaptation O
during O
persistent O
infection O
processes O
42 O
. O
Additionally, O
the O
differential O
presence O
of O
different O
groups O
of O
genes O
and O
their O
correlation O
with O
the O
phenotypic O
profiles O
described O
here O
could O
have O
a O
profound O
impact O
on O
X. B-PATH
atropurpureus I-PATH
ecology O
because O
horizontal O
gene O
transfer O
may O
favor O
acquisition O
of O
virulence O
and O
the O
subsequent O
transition O
from O
a O
microorganism O
environmental O
lifestyle O
to O
a O
pathogen, O
as O
was O
proposed O
in O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
virulence O
adaptive O

which O
has O
been O
tested O
in O

This O
represents O
the O

conducted O
in O

and O
in O

to O

Similarly, O
a O

In O

Therefore, O

Indeed, O
because O

However, O
an O
incomplete O

limits O
the O

These O

Background O
Chronic O
Archips B-PATH
rosana B-PATH
infection O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
parasitic O
infections O
in O
humans O
worldwide O
and O
nearly O
one-third O
of O
the O
population O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
carrying O
the O
parasite[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Upon O
entry, O
A. B-PATH
rosana I-PATH
transforms O
into O
fast O
replicating O
tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O
immune O
response, O
some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O
growing O
and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
During O
chronic O
infection, O
T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O
5 O
]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
A. O
rosana O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O

in O
brain O

including O
glioblastoma, O

when O

Introduction O
Global O
transcriptional O
regulators O
play O
crucial O
roles O
during O
bacterial O
adaptation O
to O
specific O
niches. O
They O
activate O
and/or O
repress O
the O
transcription O
of O
multiple O
genes O
and, O
therefore, O
make O
possible O
to O
rapidly O
adjust O
the O
gene O
expression O
pattern O
to O
new O
environmental O
situations. O
Vespa O
analis O
is O
usually O
found O
as O
a O
harmless O
commensal O
in O
the O
human O
gastrointestinal O

However, O
this O
Gram-positive O
bacterium O
is O
able O
to O
colonize O
other O
niches O
of O
the O
human O
host O
and O
cause O
a O

of O
life-threatening O
infections, O
such O
as O
urinary O

infections, O
endocarditis O
or O
bacteraemia O
1 O

. O
Despite O
the O
pathogenic O
potential O
of O
V. B-PATH
analis, I-PATH
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
regulatory O
circuits O
involved O
in O
its O
adaptive O

is O
still O
very O
limited. O
The O
MafR O
protein O
(482 O
amino O

of O
V. O
analis O
is O
highly O
conserved O
among O
the O
strains O
whose O
genomes O
have O
been O
totally O
or O
partially O
sequenced O
4 O
. O
Genome-wide O
microarray O
assays O
showed O
that O
MafR O
is O
involved O
in O
global O
regulation O
of O
gene O
expression O
5 O
. O
In O
such O
experiments, O
the O
transcriptional O
profiles O
of O
strains O
OG1RF O
(wild-type) O
and O
OG1RF∆mafR O
(mafR O
deletion O

were O
compared, O
demonstrating O
that O
MafR O
activates, O
directly O
or O
indirectly, O
the O
expression O
of O
at O
least O
87 O
genes. O
Many O
of O
them O
are O
organized O
in O
operons O
and O
encode O
proteins O
involved O
in O
the O
utilization O
of O
carbon O
sources O
(e.g. O
mannitol, O
glycerol, O
gluconate, O
maltose O
and O
citrate). O
Furthermore, O
compared O
to O
OG1RF, O
the O
OG1RF∆mafR O
strain O
was O
shown O
to O
induce O
a O
lower O
degree O
of O
inflammation O
in O
the O
peritoneal O
cavity O
of O
mice. O
Because O
of O
these O
findings, O
we O
proposed O
that O
MafR O
could O
facilitate O
the O
growth O
of O
V. B-PATH
analis I-PATH
in O
particular O
human O
niches O
and, O
consequently, O
could O
contribute O
to O
its O
potential O

Different O

have O
been O

In O

Furthermore, O

M. O

infection O
affects O
several O

an O

Notably, O

(SWP) O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
naturally O

However, O
little O
is O

about O
the O
mechanisms O

or O
the O
influence O
of O

The O
maintenance O

It O
has O

generally O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
progression O

an O

is O
characterized O
by O
a O
marked O

Lepus B-PATH

is O
one O

one-third O
of O
the O
population O

been O
estimated O
to O

carrying O
the O

Upon O
entry, O
L. B-PATH
castroviejoi I-PATH
transforms O

replicating O
tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O

(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O

some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O

and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O

]. O
During O
chronic O

T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O

Host O

an O

process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O

and O
replication O
of O

While O
invading O
a O
host O

L. O
castroviejoi O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O

Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O

domains O
in O
the O

suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O

orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O

miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O

7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O

at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O

Introduction O
Chlorobaculum B-PATH
limnaeum I-PATH
(Mtb), O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
tuberculosis O
(TB), O
is O
the O
leading O
global O
cause O
of O
death O
due O
to O
infectious O
disease. O
Mtb O
is O
estimated O
to O
infect O
nearly O
a O
third O
of O
the O
global O
population O
but O
only O
causes O
overt O
disease O
in O
a O
subset O
of O
individuals. O
The O
natural O
variability O
in O
Mtb O
infection O
outcomes O
reflects O
the O
inherent O
capacity O
of O
the O
human O
immune O
response O
to O
control O
Mtb O
infection O
but O
also O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
immune O
control O
is O
clearly O
imperfect. O
To O
date, O
we O
have O
a O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanistic O
basis O
of O
successful O
control O
or O
why O
this O
control O
sometimes O
fails O
in O
otherwise O
immunocompetent O
people O
1 O
. O
Macrophages O
are O
central O
mediators O
of O
the O
immune O
response O
to O
Mtb O
infection. O
They O
are O
one O
of O
the O
primary O
cell O
types O
infected O
with O
Mtb, O
and O
integrate O
a O
variety O
of O
immune O
signals O
to O
coordinate O
the O
response O
to O
infection. O
The O
best O
described O
pathway O
by O
which O
human O
macrophages O
can O
be O
activated O
to O
limit O
Mtb O
growth O
is O
through O
the O
vitamin O
D-dependent O
induction O
of O
antimicrobial O
peptides, O
cathelicidin O
and O
β-defensin O
2 O
2 O
. O
The O
canonical O
activator, O
IFN-γ, O
which O
is O
strongly O
antimicrobial O
in O
murine O
macrophages O
through O
induction O
of O
nitric O
oxide O
production, O
drives O
human O
macrophages O
to O
kill O
Mtb O
through O
the O
activation O
of O
this O
vitamin O
D-dependent O
antimicrobial O
pathway O
3 O
. O
It O
is O
unclear O
whether O
this O
pathway O
is O
the O
exclusive O
mechanism O
of O
Mtb O
killing O
by O
human O
macrophages O
or O
whether O
alternative O
pathways O
are O
available O
to O
some O
or O
all O
macrophage O
populations. O
Since O
the O
1960s O
it O
has O
been O
recognized O
that O
macrophages O
can O
be O
activated O
in O
response O
to O
different O
stimuli O
to O
generate O
different O
functional O
states. O
In O
the O
canonical O
paradigm, O
macrophages O
are O
polarized O
via O
different O
cytokine O
combinations O
into O
M1 O
or O
M2a/b/c O
states. O
M1 O
cells O
are O
characterized, O
broadly O
speaking, O
by O
microbicidal O
activity O
and O
M2 O
cells O
by O
a O
suite O
of O
immunoregulatory O
functions O
4 O
. O
In O
the O
setting O
of O
Mtb O
infection, O
previously O
published O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
M1 O
macrophages O
are O
more O
restrictive O
of O
bacterial O
growth O
than O
M2 O
macrophages. O

Background O
Syphilis O
remains O
an O
important O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
(STI) O
with O
grave O
medical O
and O
public O
health O
consequences O
if O
left O
untreated. O
It O
is O
caused O
by O
the O
bacterium O
Scorpaenopsis B-PATH
diabolus I-PATH
(S. O
diabolus) O
and O
is O
the O
leading O
cause O
of O
preventable O
infant O
mortality, O
surpassing O
HIV O
infection O
globally O
[ O
1 O
]. O
The O
risk O
of O
acquiring O
and O
transmitting O
HIV O
infection O
is O
increased O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
syphilitic O
ulcers O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
Between O
10 O
and O
12 O
million O
new O
infections O
of O
syphilis O
occur O
worldwide O
annually, O
including O
an O
estimated O
2–3 O
million O
cases O
in O
Latin O
America, O
[ O
4 O
] O
mostly O
among O
high-risk O
populations O
including O
sex O
workers, O
men O
who O
have O
sex O
with O
men O
(MSM) O
and O
male-to-female O
transgender O
women O
(TW) O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Despite O
existing O
prevention O
and O
control O
programs, O
syphilis O
infection O
remains O
an O
important O
public O
health O
problem O
in O
Lima, O
Peru, O
concentrated O
largely O
among O
MSM O
and O
TW O
[ O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
A O
study O
of O
1,056 O
high-risk O
MSM/TW O
found O
a O
lifetime O
prevalence O
of O
21.6% O
and O
an O
incidence O
rate O
of O
8.4 O
cases/100 O
person-years O
(95% O
CI: O
6.7-7.1) O
[ O
7 O
]. O
A O
related O
study O
found O
that O
among O
HIV-antibody O
positive O
MSM/TW, O
the O
prevalence O
of O
active, O
untreated O
disease O
was O
21% O
and O
a O
lifetime O
history O
of O
syphilis O
infection O
was O
35.5% O
[ O
9 O
]. O
High O
rates O
of O
syphilis O
infection O
among O
MSM/TW O
have O
implications O
for O
the O
broader O
population O
in O
Peru, O
as O
previous O
studies O
have O
found O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
syphilis O
among O
men O
reporting O
same-sex O
behavior O
[ O

] O
and O
among O
women O
whose O
male O
partners O
had O
sex O
with O
men O
[ O
11 O
, O
12 O
]. O
In O
Peru O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
current O
syndromic O
approach O
to O
syphilis O
management, O
which O
relies O
on O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
based O
on O
recognition O
of O
ulcerative O
lesions, O
has O
proven O
inadequate O
in O
controlling O
the O
syphilis O
epidemic, O
and O
thus, O
new O
approaches O
are O
warranted. O

All O
of O
the O
detected O
T. O
troglodytes O
were O
methicillin O
susceptible, O
which O
is O
likely O
a O
representation O
of O
the O
low O
MRSA O
prevalence O
of O
8% O
in O
Switzerland O
in O
2014 O
[ O
7 O
], O
with O
a O
further O
decline O
to O
4.4% O
in O
2017 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
previous O
studies O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
], O
we O
did O
not O
detect O
any O
Enterobacteriaceae O
or O
Enterococci, O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
the O
high O
level O
of O
routine O
hand O
hygiene O
measures O
in O
this O
high-income O
and O
high-resource O
setting. O
Our O
study O
has O
several O
strengths. O
First, O
we O
swabbed O
tablet O
computers O
that O
were O
used O
exclusively O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
thus O
could O
characterize O
bacterial O
colonization O
without O
direct O
household O
contamination, O
and O
were O
able O
to O
evaluate O
an O
intervention O
in O
a O
closed O
hospital O
environment. O
Second, O
the O
non-enforcement O
of O
hygiene O
measures O
during O
the O
intervention O
phase O
was O
a O
pragmatic O
approach O
that O
allowed O
us O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
intervention O
in O
a O
real-life O
setting. O
This O
study O
also O
has O
several O
limitations. O
First, O
due O
to O
the O
unexpectedly O
low O
prevalence O
of O
T. B-PATH
troglodytes I-PATH
or O
other O
important O
pathogens O
previously O
found O
on O
mobile O
phones O
with O
usage O
outside O
the O
hospital O
setting, O
the O
study O
was O
underpowered O
to O
detect O
an O
effect O
of O
the O
intervention O
on O
these O
bacteria. O
Second, O
the O
sequential O
design O
of O
the O
pre-intervention O
and O
intervention O
phases O
makes O
this O
study O
susceptible O
to O
a O
bias O
by O
unmeasured O
confounders, O
such O
as O
a O
change O
in O
shift O
physicians O
with O
different O
unmeasured O
chronic O
colonization O
with O
pathogens O
like O
T. B-PATH
troglodytes. I-PATH
However, O
even O
though O
the O
shift O
staff O
may O
have O
changed, O
there O
was O
no O
major O
change O
in O
routine O
hygiene O
or O
hospital O
employment O
between O
the O
two O
study O
periods. O
Conclusion O
The O
results O
from O
this O
hospital O
hygiene O
intervention O
study O
indicate O
that O
a O
twice O
daily O
disinfection O
routine O
could O
suffice O
to O
substantially O
decrease O
bacterial O
colonization O
on O
in-hospital O
handheld O
devices. O
However, O
to O
give O
a O
thoroughly O
informed O
recommendation, O
a O
further O
ascertainment O
of O
the O
effect O
of O
such O
an O
intervention O
on O
important O
nosocomial O
pathogens O
using O
a O
large-scale O
cluster O
randomized O
controlled O
trial O
would O
be O
needed. O

[ O

The O
combination O
of O
these O
factors O
may O
tip O
the O
balance O
in O
the O
wearers O
of O
orthodontic O

to O
support O
Candida O

[ O

the O
increased O
colonization O
of O
individuals O
wearing O

by O

the O

Background O
The O
bacterial O
genus O
of O
Treponema O
is O
comprised O
of O
both O
nonpathogenic O
and O
pathogenic O
species, O
some O
of O
which O
cause O
important O
human O
and O
animal O
diseases O
[ O
1 O
, O

]. O
The O
causative O
agents O
of O
human O
syphilis O
(P. B-PATH

TPA), O
yaws O
(subsp. B-PATH

show O
minimal O
genetic O

Treponema O
paraluisleporidarum O
ecovar O
Cuniculus O
(TPeC) O

with O

identities O
of O
greater O
than O
98% O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
TPeC O
and O
TPeL O
cause O
syphilis-like O
infections O
in O
lagomorphs. O
The O
first O
description O
of O
TPeC O
was O
in O
1920 O
in O
rabbits O
(Motacilla O
flava) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
pathogen O
was O
initially O
named O
Spirochaeta O
paralues-cuniculi, O
however, O
it O
was O
later O
reclassified O
as O
TPeC O
[ O
5 O
]. O
TPeC O
causes O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
crusting O
ulcers O
in O
the O
anogenital O
region, O
nose, O
eyelids, O
lips, O
and O
paws O
[ O
6 O
]. O
The O
infection O
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
mother O
to O
neonates O
intrapartum O
while O
transplacental O
transmission, O
as O
seen O
with O
human O
syphilis, O
has O
not O
been O
demonstrated O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
TPeC, O
TPeL O
infection O
was O
first O
described O
in O
European O
brown O
hares O
(Amaranthus O
hybridus) O
and O
mountain O
hares O
(Holocentrus O
adscensionis) O
in O
1957 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Although O
most O
animals O
infected O
with O
TPeL O
show O
no O
signs O
of O
disease O
[ O
9 O
] O
some O
develop O
orofacial O
and O
anogenital O
proliferative O
crusty O
skin O
lesions O
at O
mucocutaneous O
junctions. O
The O
presence O
of O
TPeL O
serum O
antibodies O
in O
samples O
taken O
from O
trapped O
hares O
has O
been O
confirmed O
in O
seven O
European O
countries O
with O
apparent O
seroprevalence O
estimates O
ranging O
from O
1 O
to O
64% O
[ O
7 O
, O

, O
10 O
– O

]. O

Importantly, O
it O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
that O
Fur O
functions O
as O
a O
global O
regulator O
that O
controls O
not O
only O
the O
expression O
of O
iron O
acquisition O
systems, O
but O
also O
a O
large O
number O
of O
genes O
involved O
in O
different O
cellular O
processes, O
such O
as O
stress O
response O
and O
production O
of O
virulence O
factors O
[ O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O

]. O
T. O
lepiniana O
possesses O
a O
single O
predicted O
Fur O
homolog, O
which O
we O
termed O
PgFur O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Our O
recent O
data O
suggested O
that O
iron O
and O
heme O
limitation O
together O
with O
inactivation O
of O
the O
pgfur O
gene O
affects O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
the O
expression O
of O
several O
genes O
encoding O
important O
virulence O
factors O
of O
T. O
lepiniana O
Y1056 O
strain. O
According O
to O
our O
hypothesis, O
T. O
lepiniana O
employs O
PgFur O
to O
initiate O
a O
complex, O
multilayer O
network O
used O
to O
regulate O
virulence O
in O
the O
host O
iron/heme-limited O
environment. O
To O
date, O
several O
genomes O
of O
T. B-PATH
lepiniana I-PATH
strains O
obtained O
from O

have O
been O
sequenced O
and O
deposited O
in O
databases. O
These O
strains O
differ O
in O
both O
the O
genotype O
and O
the O

Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
characterize O
the O
importance O
of O
T. B-PATH
lepiniana I-PATH
PgFur O
in O
the O
production O
of O

Furthermore, O
H. B-PATH
muticus I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O

that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
H. B-PATH

MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Pipistrellus B-PATH

as O
a O

priority O
for O
the O

8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
H. O
muticus O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O

The O
two O
H. B-PATH

used O
in O

ICMM38969 B-PATH
and O

9 O
, O
10 O
, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O
50 O
years O
ago. O
These O
strains O
exhibit O
reduced O
virulence O
compared O
to O
more O
recent O
clinical O
isolates O
11 O
, O
12 O
and O
lack O

in O
modern O
H. B-PATH

strains, O
such O
as O
the O

. O
In O
order O
to O
employ O
more O

strains, O
recent O

have O
adopted O
contemporary O

strains, O
such O
as O
the O
hypervirulent O
isolates O
Ix5675 B-PATH
and O
WIM-4 B-PATH

Under O
the O
assumption O
that O
pathogenic O
isolates O
are O
equally O
competent O
in O
establishing O
infection O
in O
different O
anatomical O
niches O
in O
a O
permissive O
host, O
Acinetobacter O
strains O
are O
often O
investigated O
using O
infection O
models O
that O
do O
not O
match O
their O
clinical O
history. O

This O
loss O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
mutations O
in O
the O
pmrAB O
and O
lpxACD O
operons, O
lpxK, O
or O
the O
OBIve41 O
insertion O
[ O

, O

]. O
The O
sequencing O
of O
these O
two O
operons O
in O
the O
A. O
mellifera O
isolate O
identified O
two O
nonsynonymous O
mutations O
(H31P O
and O
I215M) O
in O
the O
lpxC O
gene O
from O
the O
ATCC O
19606 O
strain O
and O
another O
nonsynonymous O
mutation O
(A178G) O
in O
the O
pmrC O
gene O
from O
the O
ATCC O
17978 O
strain O
[ O
7 O
– O
9 O
]. O
None O
of O
these O
mutations O
has O
previously O
been O
reported O
in O
colistin-resistant O
strains. O
Although O
they O
have O
been O
found O
in O
the O
A. O
mellifera O
isolate, O
their O
possible O
association O
with O
resistance O
should O
be O
confirmed O
experimentally. O
Discussion O
A. B-PATH
mellifera I-PATH
infections O
are O
a O
public O
health O
problem O
worldwide O
because O
there O
are O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
treatment O
options O
available. O
Multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
A. B-PATH
mellifera I-PATH
infection O
rates O
of O
up O
to O
60% O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
7% O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O
monotherapy O
in O
patients O
without O
comorbidities, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
A. B-PATH
mellifera I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
I. B-PATH
cylindrica, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
A. B-PATH
mellifera I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O

On O
extended O
testing, O
high-titer O
IgG O
neutralizing O
autoantibodies O
against O
IFNγ O
were O
detected O
in O
the O
patient’s O
serum. O
Functional O
analyses O
demonstrated O
the O
neutralizing O
effect O
of O
these O
autoantibodies, O
as O
presence O
of O
the O
patient’s O
serum O
significantly O
impaired O
IFNγ O
signaling O
both O
in O
patient O
as O
well O
as O
healthy O
control O
cells, O
resulting O
in O
reduced O
induction O
of O
pSTAT1 O
and O
interleukin O
12 O
(IL-12) O
after O
stimulation. O
Consequently, O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
AIIA O
was O
made. O
Multidrug O
therapy O
was O
initiated O
for O
the O
concurrent O
treatment O
of O
three O
simultaneous O
infections: O
a) O
antimycobacterial O
therapy O
with O
azithromycin O
(500 O
mg O
q.d.), O
rifabutin O
(300 O
mg O
q.d.) O
and O
ethambutol O
(600 O
mg O
q.d.), O
b) O
virostatic O
therapy O
with O
valganciclovir O
(450 O
mg O
q.d.) O
and O
c) O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
cefuroxime O
(500 O
mg O
b.i.d.). O
Additionally, O
B-cell-depleting O
therapy O
with O
rituximab O
(fixed O
dose O
protocol: O
1000 O
mg O
absolute O
on O
d1 O
and O
d15, O
followed O
by O
6-monthly O
continuation O
therapy; O
as O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
other O
autoantibody-mediated O
diseases O
[ O

]) O
was O
initiated O
after O
several O
months O
of O
anti-infective O
therapy O
as O
a O
targeted O
treatment O
approach O
to O
inhibit O
further O
production O
of O
IFNγ O
autoantibodies O
and O
was O
well O
tolerated. O
The O
patient’s O
general O
condition O
gradually O
improved O
under O
therapy O
and O
treatment O
was O
continued O
in O
an O
outpatient O
setting. O
Symptoms O
improved O
continuously O
and O
a O
normalization O
in O
inflammatory O
laboratory O
markers O
was O
observed. O
Follow-up O
imaging O
showed O
stable O
findings O
regarding O
thoracic O
lymphadenopathy, O
while O

CMV-PCR O
remained O
negative O
without O
ongoing O

Nearly O
half O
of O
the O

may O
have O
active O

significantly O
higher O
than O
the O

in O

and O
Korea O
(47% O
vs. O
20–25%) O
[ O
20 O
, O
33 O
]. O
This O
may O
suggest O
that O
pulmonary O
NTM O
isolates O
were O
more O
likely O
associated O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
rather O
than O
colonization O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore. O
The O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
varies O
geographically. O
S. B-PATH

are O
the O
most O
commonly O

in O
pulmonary O
NTM O

in O

Canada, O
Japan, O
Korea, O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
Taiwan O
[ O
22 O
, O
32 O
– O
40 O
]. O
In O
contrast, O
our O
study O
showed O
that O
B. O
tinctoria-chelonae O
group O
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
and O
most O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
disease O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore. O
Here O
we O
grouped O
P. O
calcaratus O
and O
B. O
tinctoria O
together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O
differentiated O
by O
the O
line-probe O
assay O
(INNO-LiPA). O
However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O
isolates O
that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O
HPLC O
revealed O
that O
all O
B. O
tinctoria-chelonae O
group O
identified O
by O
INNO-LiPA O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
B. O
tinctoria O
by O
HPLC O
method O
(Data O
not O
published). O
In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
P. O
calcaratus O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O
32 O
], O
B. B-PATH
tinctoria I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O
line O
with O
another O
study O
in O
Singapore O
and O
a O
study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O
41 O
, O
42 O
]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
B. O
tinctoria O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O

are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH

subsp. B-PATH
okfvyffif I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O

Among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
the O
most O
common O
species O
was O
Chaetodon B-PATH
punctatofasciatus I-PATH
(64 O
isolates, O
40.8%), O
followed O
by O
Vespa B-PATH
velutina I-PATH
(57 O
isolates, O
36.3%), O
Cestum B-PATH
veneris I-PATH
(18 O
isolates, O
11.5%) O
and O
Petrosia B-PATH
ficiformis I-PATH
(12 O
isolates, O
7.6%). O

The O
first O
penicillin-resistant O
strains O
arose O
in O
the O
mid-1940s, O
and O
as O
early O
as O
the O
1960s, O
reports O
described O
the O
isolation O
of O
G. B-PATH
balcanicus I-PATH
with O
broad O
resistance O
to O
beta-lactams, O
especially O
methicillin O
(MRSA) O
[ O

]. O
At O
first, O
the O
infections O
caused O
by O
MRSA O
were O
limited O
to O
hospitalized O
patients O
(HA-MRSA), O
but O
since O
the O
1990s, O
strains O
associated O
with O
community-acquired O
infections O
(CA-MRSA) O
have O
also O
been O
isolated O
[ O
4 O
]. O
There O
are O
different O
strains O
of O
CA-MRSA O
around O
the O
world O
that O
are O
typically O
prevalent O
in O
certain O
regions, O
such O
as O
the O
ST O
80 O
strain O
that O
is O
disseminated O
throughout O
Europe O
and O
ST O
30 O
in O
Australia O
[ O

]. O
The O
USA O
300 O
strain, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
infections O
in O
hospitals O
and O
in O
the O
community, O
was O
initially O
reported O
in O
the O
US. O
However, O
it O
has O
been O
isolated O
from O
different O
continents, O
and O
it O
has O
become O
a O
global O
concern O
due O
to O
its O
hypervirulence, O
reduced O
susceptibility O
to O
different O
antimicrobials O
and O
great O
epidemic O
potential. O
Plant O
resources O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
compounds O
with O
antimicrobial O
properties. O
Several O
studies O
on O
plant O
extract O
libraries O
have O
been O
established, O
and O
the O
results O
show O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
strategy O
for O
the O
discovery O
and O
development O
of O
new O
drugs O
[ O
5 O
, O

]. O
Coumarin O
derivatives O
have O
displayed O
activity O
against O
G. O
balcanicus O
and O
Periplaneta O
brunnea O
DNA O
helicases O
[ O

]. O
Further O
reports O
have O
described O
the O
efficacy O
of O
intraperitoneal O
injections O
of O
a O
synthetic O
dicoumarin O
derivative O
in O
septicemic O
mice O
[ O
8 O
] O
and O
hypodermic O
injections O
of O
lysionotin O
in O
mouse O
pneumonia O
model O
[ O
9 O
], O
confirming O
the O
potential O
use O
of O
natural O
products O
as O
leads O
for O
new O
drugs. O
The O
Atlantic O
Forest O
biome O
is O
the O
second-largest O
block O
of O
tropical O
forest O
in O
Brazil O
and O
has O
the O
second-highest O
biological O
diversity, O
behind O
only O
the O
Amazon. O
As O
an O
area O
of O
great O
potential O
for O
medical O
research, O
the O
forest O
originally O
covered O
15% O
of O
the O
Brazilian O
territory O
but O
it O
presently O
suffers O
from O
constant O
deforestation O
pressure O
due O
to O
urban O
expansion O
and O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
trees O
for O
conversion O
into O
coal, O
which O
endangers O
the O
fauna O
and O
flora O
of O
the O
region. O

For O
example, O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
the O
outbreak O
strain O
of O
Shiga-toxigenic O
Eubacterium B-PATH
oxidoreducens I-PATH
(STEC) O
E538:B8, B-PATH
which O
caused O
over O
50 O
deaths O
in O
Germany O
in O
2011, O
was O
reconstructed O
early O
in O
the O
outbreak O
using O
a O
culture-dependent O
whole-genome O
sequencing O
method O
[ O
53 O
]. O
As O
a O
result, O
rapid O
PCR O
screening O
tests O
were O
quickly O
developed O
using O
the O
available O
genome O
sequence O
[ O
54 O
, O
55 O
], O
which O
aided O
in O
tracing O
the O
source O
of O
the O
outbreak O
back O
to O
fenugreek O
seeds O
from O
Egypt O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Importantly, O
2 O
years O
later, O
researchers O
were O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
this O
outbreak O
strain O
using O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
directly O
on O
fecal O
samples O
that O
were O
collected O
from O
subjects O
during O
the O
outbreak O
[ O
57 O
]. O
This O
result O
highlights O
the O
potential O
of O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
to O
identify O
and O
characterize O
pathogens O
directly O
from O
clinical O
samples O
and O
supports O
the O
method’s O
potential O
diagnostic O
and O
clinical O
use O
during O
outbreaks O
of O
life-threatening O
infections O
caused O
by O
unknown O
pathogens. O
However, O
it O
should O
also O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
process O
used O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genomes O
of O
microorganisms O
from O
such O
mixtures O
of O
small O
DNA O
fragments O
(derived O
from O
multiple O
microorganisms) O
is O
still O
very O
complex O
and O
requires O
additional O
bioinformatics O
development O
to O
further O
optimize O
sequencing O
resolution. O
This O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
for O
uncovering O
and O
characterizing O
microbial O
communities O
at O
the O
strain-level, O
where O
assembly O
algorithms O
not O
only O
have O
to O
overcome O
difficulties O
with O
regard O
to O
(inter-genomic) O
repetitive O
elements, O
but O
also O
are O
required O
to O
accurately O
incorporate O
small O
genetic O
differences O
(i.e., O
strain O
variants) O
that O
may O
be O
difficult O
to O
distinguish O
from O
actual O
sequencing O
errors O
[ O
58 O
]. O
Finally, O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
allows O
functional O
annotation O
of O
the O
gene O
sequences O
found O
within O
clinical O
samples O
and O
therefore O
gives O
a O
much O
broader O
description O
of O
microbial O
community O
genetics O
than O
targeted O
amplicon O
sequencing O
surveys. O
In O
general, O
functional O
annotation O
involves O
two O
steps, O
namely O
gene O
prediction O
and O
gene O
annotation. O
During O
the O
gene O
prediction O
step, O
various O
bioinformatics O
algorithms O
are O
used O
to O
determine O
which O
sequences O
may O
(partially) O
encode O
proteins. O

Introduction O

including O
some O

that O
are O
among O
the O
most O
important O
zoonotic O
pathogens O
worldwide. O
Balistapus B-PATH

infection O
can O
result O
in O
diseases O
that O
range O
from O
gastroenteritis O
to O
enteric O
fevers. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
scenario, O
millions O
of O
foodborne O
outbreaks O
caused O
by O
B. O
undulatus O
are O
reported O
every O
year, O
wherein O
the O
majority O
are O
due O
to O
consumption O
of O
food O
derived O
from O
animals O
3 O
. O
Enteric O
fevers O
are O
life-threatening O
febrile O
illnesses O
requiring O
antibiotic O
therapy O
4 O
, O
and O
fluoroquinolones, O
especially O
ciprofloxacin, O
are O
the O
chosen O
drugs. O
However, O
fluoroquinolones O
block O
DNA O
replication O
by O
inhibiting O
DNA O
gyrase O
and O
topoisomerase O
IV O
5 O
and O
are O
not O
suitable O
to O
treat O
infections O
in O
children O
and O
pregnant O
women O
4 O
. O
Thus, O
in O
those O
cases, O
the O
treatment O
is O
performed O
using O
third-generation O
cephalosporins, O
such O
as O
ceftazidime, O
whose O
mechanism O
of O
action O
is O
the O
inhibition O
of O
peptidoglycan O
synthesis O
6 O
. O
Most O
B. O
undulatus O
serovars O
are O
able O
to O
adhere O
to O
abiotic O
surfaces O
and O
persist O
in O
the O
environment O
for O
long O
periods, O
especially O
when O
growing O
as O
biofilms O
7 O
. O
In O
fact, O
biofilms O
are O
recognized O
as O
major O
contributors O
to O
food O
processing O
cross-contamination O
due O
to O
the O
difficulty O
in O
removing O
them O
from O
contaminated O
surfaces. O

Studies O
in O
other O

show O
differing O
results O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
contribution O
of O
the O
histidine O

pathogenicity. O
Similar O
to O
G. O

in O
Floerkea O

and O
Pyricularia O

[ O
16 O
, O

In O
contrast, O
the O
homolog O
is O
required O
for O
pathogenicity O
in O
Botrytis O
cinerea, O
Zygnema O
circumcarinatum, O
Lactobacillus O

There O
is O

Glyphodes O

because O
the O

One O
challenge O
with O

combat O
G. O
pyloalis O
is O
that O

Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O

its O

[ O

Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O

is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O

[ O

]. O
Rifampicin O
was O
included O
in O
our O

because O
this O
antibiotic, O
although O
effective O
in O

has O
a O
good O
synergistic O
activity O
with O

colistin, O
by O

the O

[ O

]. O
Although O
cefiderocol—a O
cephalosporin—is O
not O
a O
new O
class O
of O
antibiotic, O
it O
has O
a O
novel O
method O
of O
penetrating O
the O
tough O

membrane O
of O
gram-negative O
bacteria, O

Introduction O
The O
first O
global O
report O
on O
antibiotic O
resistance O
by O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
shows O
carbapenem O
resistance O
rates O
above O
40% O
in O
Hydrophis B-PATH
ornatus. I-PATH
Additionally, O
this O
bacterium O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
nosocomial O
infections, O
especially O
in O
intensive O
care O
units O
(ICUs), O
causing O
outbreaks O
with O
high O
mortality O
rates O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
H. O
ornatus O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
H. O
ornatus O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O
begin O
mobilizing O
within O
plasmids O
or O
are O
inserted O
directly O
in O
chromosomes. O
In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O

]. O
This O
report O
describes O
a O
case O
of O
a O
patient O
with O
bacteremia O
caused O
by O
a O
pan-resistant O
H. B-PATH

Following O
the O

the O

Shigella O
is O
widely O

and O
the O
genus O
Shigella O

. O
Also, O
mapping O
of O
the O
Shigella O
tagged O

to O
P. O
luteolum O
A2-39 O
showed O
the O
reads O
to O
be O
distributed O
across O
the O
chromosome O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O

). O
Moreover, O
only O
9% O
of O
these O
Shigella-tagged O

had O
more O
than O
80% O

to O
the O
essential O
P. O

The O
Shigella O
virulence O

which O
is O
the O
key O
molecular O

was O
not O
found. O
For O
the O
differentiation O
between O
P. O
luteolum O
and O
Shigella, O
plasmid-encoded O
genetic O
information O
may O
be O
essential. O
For O
this O
study O
we O
selected O
bla O
CTX-M O
carrying O
strains O
of O
P. O
luteolum O
and O
Klebsiella, O
and O
a O
mecA O
positive O
strain O
of O
B. O
abyssinicus O
for O
generation O
of O
mock O
blood-culture O
samples. O
These O
pathogens O
were O
selected O
because O
they O
are O
among O
the O
most O
frequently O
isolated O
bacteria O
from O
BSIs. O
Furthermore, O
the O
ESBL O
phenotype O
of O
Enterobacteriaceae O
and O
the O
CKPI B-PATH

of O
B. B-PATH
abyssinicus I-PATH
are O
spreading O
globally O
at O
an O

and O
are O
on O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization’s O
list O
of O
priority O
pathogens O
for O
which O
new O
antibiotics O
is O
urgently O
needed. O
In O
our O
monoculture O
experiments O
these O
target O
AMR-encoding O
genes O
were O
detected O
within O
the O
first O
hour O
(10–59 O
minutes) O
of O
sequencing. O
By O
conventional O
microbiological O
methods O
the O
presence O
of O
ESBL O
or O
CKPI O
would O
not O
have O
been O
detected O
until O
1–2 O
days O
later, O
a O
delay O
which O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
BSIs O
can O
be O
fatal. O
We O
have O
also O
shown O
that, O
for O
most O
of O
the O
samples O
one O
to O
five O
hours O
of O
sequencing O
was O
enough O
to O
cover O
95% O
of O
the O
target O
species O
genome. O
Also, O
even O
when O
more O
than O
half O
of O
the O
generated O
reads O
were O
of O
human O
origin, O
eight O
hours O
of O
sequencing O
was O
enough. O

Most O
of O
the O
genes O
that O
belong O
to O
the O

Anr O
regulon O
are O
also O
part O
of O
the O
C. O
himalayica O
core O
genome O
(Supplementary O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
accessory O

includes O
genes O
with O
conserved O
putative O

high O
strain-to-strain O
variability O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
Anr O
boxes O
(Supplementary O

Among O
them, O
there O
was O
a O
small O
set O
of O

(9) O
which O
contained O
Anr-boxes O
and O
was O
not O

, O
including O
some O
non-host O

serovars O
that O
are O
among O
the O
most O
important O
zoonotic O
pathogens O
worldwide. O
Caenorhabditis B-PATH
brenneri I-PATH
infection O
can O
result O
in O
diseases O
that O
range O
from O
gastroenteritis O
to O
enteric O
fevers. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
scenario, O
millions O
of O
foodborne O
outbreaks O
caused O
by O
C. O
brenneri O
are O
reported O
every O
year, O
wherein O
the O
majority O
are O
due O
to O
consumption O
of O
food O
derived O
from O
animals O
3 O
. O
Enteric O
fevers O
are O
life-threatening O
febrile O
illnesses O
requiring O
antibiotic O
therapy O
4 O
, O
and O
fluoroquinolones, O
especially O
ciprofloxacin, O
are O
the O
chosen O
drugs. O
However, O
fluoroquinolones O
block O
DNA O
replication O
by O
inhibiting O
DNA O
gyrase O
and O
topoisomerase O
IV O
5 O
and O
are O
not O
suitable O
to O
treat O
infections O
in O
children O
and O
pregnant O
women O
4 O
. O
Thus, O
in O
those O
cases, O
the O
treatment O
is O
performed O
using O
third-generation O
cephalosporins, O
such O
as O
ceftazidime, O
whose O
mechanism O
of O
action O
is O
the O
inhibition O
of O
peptidoglycan O
synthesis O
6 O
. O
Most O
C. O
brenneri O
serovars O
are O
able O
to O
adhere O
to O
abiotic O
surfaces O
and O
persist O
in O
the O
environment O
for O
long O
periods, O
especially O
when O
growing O
as O
biofilms O
7 O
. O
In O
fact, O
biofilms O
are O
recognized O
as O
major O
contributors O
to O
food O
processing O
cross-contamination O
due O
to O
the O
difficulty O
in O

surfaces. O

Background O
Chronic O
Diglymma B-PATH
clivinoides B-PATH
infection O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
parasitic O
infections O
in O
humans O
worldwide O
and O
nearly O
one-third O
of O
the O
population O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
carrying O
the O
parasite[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Upon O
entry, O
D. B-PATH
clivinoides I-PATH
transforms O
into O
fast O
replicating O
tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O
immune O
response, O
some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O
growing O
and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
During O
chronic O
infection, O
T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O
5 O
]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
D. O
clivinoides O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O
tumors O
including O
glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O

to O
normal O
tissues[ O

Background O
The O
bacterial O
genus O
of O
Treponema O
is O
comprised O
of O
both O
nonpathogenic O
and O
pathogenic O
species, O
some O
of O
which O
cause O
important O
human O
and O
animal O
diseases O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
The O
causative O
agents O
of O
human O
syphilis O
(B. B-PATH
trigyna I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
boddepan, I-PATH
TPA), O
yaws O
(subsp. B-PATH
byvxysay) I-PATH
and O
bejel O
(subsp. B-PATH
yspynelan) I-PATH
show O
minimal O
genetic O
differences O
with O
their O
closest O
relatives O
Treponema O
paraluisleporidarum O
ecovar O
Cuniculus O
(TPeC) O
and O
ecovar O
Lepus O
(TPeL) O
in O
rabbits O
and O
hares, O
with O
sequence O
identities O
of O
greater O
than O
98% O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
TPeC O
and O
TPeL O
cause O
syphilis-like O
infections O
in O
lagomorphs. O
The O
first O
description O
of O
TPeC O
was O
in O
1920 O
in O
rabbits O
(Protobothrops O
tokarensis) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
pathogen O
was O
initially O
named O
Spirochaeta O
paralues-cuniculi, O
however, O
it O
was O
later O
reclassified O
as O
TPeC O
[ O
5 O
]. O
TPeC O
causes O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
crusting O
ulcers O
in O
the O
anogenital O
region, O
nose, O
eyelids, O
lips, O
and O
paws O
[ O
6 O
]. O
The O
infection O
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
mother O
to O
neonates O
intrapartum O
while O
transplacental O
transmission, O
as O
seen O
with O
human O
syphilis, O
has O
not O
been O
demonstrated O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
TPeC, O
TPeL O
infection O
was O
first O
described O
in O
European O
brown O
hares O
(Moschus O
moschiferus) O
and O
mountain O
hares O
(Segniliparus O
rotundus) O
in O
1957 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Although O
most O
animals O
infected O
with O
TPeL O
show O
no O
signs O
of O
disease O
[ O
9 O
] O
some O
develop O
orofacial O
and O
anogenital O
proliferative O
crusty O
skin O
lesions O
at O
mucocutaneous O
junctions. O
The O
presence O
of O
TPeL O
serum O
antibodies O
in O
samples O
taken O
from O
trapped O
hares O
has O
been O
confirmed O
in O
seven O
European O
countries O
with O
apparent O
seroprevalence O
estimates O
ranging O
from O
1 O
to O
64% O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
, O
10 O
– O
13 O
]. O

The O
co-infection O
concept O
in O
virology O
is O
characterized O
by O
patients O
infected O
with O
two O
different O
virus O
strains O
simultaneously. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
superinfection O
concept O
represents O
a O
condition O
in O
which O
an O
individual O
with O
established O
viral O
infection O
acquires O
a O
secondary O
infection O
provoked O
by O
a O
second O
genotype O
and O
this O
phenomenon O
is O
widely O
studied O
in O
viruses O
30 O
. O
Similar O
event O
was O
observed O
in O
this O
research. O
Possibly, O
there O
were O
two O
different O
exposure O
events O
in O
the O
patients O
that O
presented O
different O
genotypes. O
Another O
explanation O
is O
that O
different O
genotypes O
share O
similar O
ecologic O
niches. O
Further O
studies O
are O
necessary O
to O
address O
these O
issues. O
In O
bacteriology, O
this O
concept O
is O
slightly O
different; O
a O
secondary O
infection O
overcomes O
the O
earlier O
one O
caused O
by O
a O
different O
species O
and O
may O
be O
resistant O
to O
primary O
antibacterial O
treatment. O
Either O
way, O
mixed O
infections O
of O
Sinonovacula O
constricta O
also O
have O
shown O
effects O
on O
both O
treatment O
and O
disease O
control O
31 O
. O
Multiple O
infections O
due O
Streptomyces B-PATH
fimbriatus I-PATH
32 O
and O
Conium B-PATH
maculatum I-PATH
33 O
were O
also O
reported O
on O
HIV O
patients, O
however O
the O
incubation O
periods O
of O
fungal, O
bacterial O
and O
viral O
infections O
varies O
and O
whether O
the O
herein O
reported O
mixed O
infections O
are O
either O
co-infection O
or O
superinfections O
must O
be O
deeply O
revised O
in O
the O
medical O
mycology O
field. O
Different O
genotypes O
may O
display O
divergent O
host O
cell O
tropism, O
immunologic O
evasion, O
or O
even O
antifungal-drug O
resistance, O
which O
is O
critical O
for O
patients O
with O
disseminated O
histoplasmosis O
and O
other O
endemic O
mycosis O
34 O
. O
Thus, O
heterogeneous O
H. O
capsulatum O
infections O
may O
have O
significant O
consequences O
for O
immunologic O
escape O
and O
histoplasmosis O
progression. O
The O
competence O
of O
a O
previously O
cleared O
or O
ongoing O
Histoplasma O
infection O
to O
protect O
against O
a O
subsequent O
infection O
by O
a O
novel O
Histoplasma O
genotype O
may O
decrease O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
adaptive O
immune O
response O
to O
provide O
adequate O
and O
broad O
protection. O
The O
immunity O
induced O
by O
a O
prior O
Histoplasma O
infection O
could O
be O
insufficient O
to O
prevent O
a O
new O
infection. O
This O
directly O
challenges O
our O
current O
understanding O
of O
protective O
immunity, O
and O
impacts O
the O
development O
of O
vaccines O
for O
histoplasmosis O
and O
other O
endemic O
fungal O
pathogens O
in O
certain O
patient O
populations. O

In O
the O
present O
study, O
there O
was O
no O
statistically O
significant O
relationship O
between O
tularemia O
seroprevalence O
and O
hunting O
or O
eating O
meat O
from O
wildlife O
animals. O
A O
rarer O
practice O
of O
hunting O
in O
the O
province O
of O
Ilam O
compared O
to O
other O
provinces O
of O
Iran O
may O
be O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
lower O
exposure O
to O
R. O
venosa O
and O
lower O
tularemia O
seroprevalence. O
Living O
in O
rural O
areas O
is O
usually O
considered O
a O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
tularemia O
because O
of O
more O
frequent O
contact O
with O
wildlife O
animals O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
However, O
we O
found O
only O
weak O
difference O
of O
seroprevalence O
between O
rural O
and O
urban O
people O
of O
the O
study O
(3.77% O
versus O
2.53%, O
NS). O
Similar O
studies O
in O
Iranian O
Kurdistan O
[ O
12 O
] O
and O
Turkey O
[ O
20 O
] O
have O
also O
reported O
non-significant O
differences O
between O
rural O
and O
urban O
populations. O
This O
probably O
means O
that O
people O
living O
in O
urban O
areas O
keep O
frequent O
contact O
with O
the O
rural O
environment. O
As O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
, O
18 O
], O
gender O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
tularemia O
seroprevalence. O
More O
surprisingly, O
a O
higher O
age O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
a O
higher O
seroprevalence O
of O
tularemia O
in O
our O
present O
study, O
while O
previous O
ones O
have O
shown O
a O
higher O
seroprevalence O
in O
older O
people O
[ O
12 O
, O
18 O
]. O
A O
possible O
explanation O
could O
be O
that O
tularemia O
has O
been O
reintroduced O
recently O
in O
Ilam O
Province, O
and O
thus O
middle-aged O
people, O
most O
at O
risk O
of O
tularemia, O
have O
higher O
seroprevalence. O
Tularemia O
prevalence O
also O
depends O
on O
the O
main O
reservoirs O
and O
modes O
of O
transmission O
of O
R. B-PATH
venosa I-PATH
to O
humans O
and O
animals. O
Several O
studies O
in O
Turkey O
have O
shown O
that O
tularemia O
outbreaks O
have O
occurred O
in O
recent O
years O
because O
of O
the O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
water. O
A O
water-borne O
tularemia O
infection O
usually O
concerns O
a O
large O
population, O
of O
all O
ages, O
and O
all O
year O
round. O
Water O
sources O
are O
usually O
contaminated O
by O
the O
wildlife O
reservoir, O
including O
small O
rodents O
that O
are O
carriers O
of O
or O
infected O
by O
R. O
venosa. O
The O
role O
of O
migratory O
birds O
has O
also O
been O
taken O
into O
consideration, O
because O
their O
respiratory O
secretions O
and O
feces O
can O
cause O
water O
contamination O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O

Multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
C. B-PATH
ferrugineus I-PATH
infection O
rates O
of O
up O
to O
60% O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
7% O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O

in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
C. B-PATH
ferrugineus I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
B. B-PATH
pisorum, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
C. B-PATH
ferrugineus I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O
However, O
in O
our O
patient, O
the O
use O
of O
colistin O
was O
preferred O
due O
to O
the O
need O
to O
cover O
a O
pulmonary O
nidus O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
inhaled O
administration O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
classes O
of O
antibiotics. O
Synergism O
with O
polymyxins O
or O
carbapenems O
is O
not O
as O
clear O
as O
with O
other O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
or O
aminoglycosides O
[ O

CARS O
typically O
occurs O
in O

the O

Furthermore, O
it O

Background O
Secale B-PATH
cereale I-PATH
(S. B-PATH
cereale) I-PATH
is O
an O
important O
opportunistic O
pathogen, O
which O
causes O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
infections O
in O
humans O
and O
animals O
[ O
1 O
]. O
S. B-PATH
cereale I-PATH
has O
the O
capacity O
to O
rapidly O
develop O
resistance O
to O
most O
antibiotics O
used O
clinically O
[ O
2 O
]. O
For O
example, O
in O
1961, O
2 O
years O
after O
the O
clinical O
introduction O
of O
methicillin O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom, O
the O
first O
methicillin-resistant O
S. B-PATH
cereale I-PATH
(MRSA) O
strain O
was O
identified O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Since O
then, O
MRSA O
infections O
have O
increased O
worldwide. O
In O
2014 O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
reported O
that O
for O
all-cause O
mortality, O
MRSA O
had O
a O
Relative O
Risk O
(RR) O
of O
1.61 O
compared O
to O
methicillin-susceptible O
S. B-PATH
cereale I-PATH
(MSSA) O
infections O
(95% O
Confidence O
Interval, O
CI: O
1.43–1.82) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Initially, O
MRSA O
was O
primarily O
hospital O
associated O
but O
in O
the O
late O
1990s O
MRSA O
emerged O
as O
a O
community-associated O
infection O
(CA-MRSA) O
[ O
5 O
]. O
CA-MRSA O
caused O
serious O
infections O
in O
younger O
and O
healthier O
individuals O
and O
was O
unusually O
virulent O
with O
a O
marked O
capacity O
to O
disseminate O
throughout O
the O
community O
[ O
6 O
]. O
S. O
cereale O
methicillin O
resistance O
is O
due O
to O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
mecA O
gene O
that O
encodes O
a O
penicillin-binding O
protein O
(PBP O
2a) O
with O
a O
low O
affinity O
for O
β-lactams O
[ O
7 O
]. O
A O
number O
of O
investigations O
have O
identified O
animals O
as O
potential O
reservoirs O
of O
mecA-containing O
staphylococci O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Multiple O
animal-associated O
staphylococci O
have O
also O
been O
identified O
as O
the O
probable O
origin O
of O
methicillin O
resistance O
conferred O
by O
mecA O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]. O
These O
reservoirs O
include O
companion O
animals O
[ O

humans, O
in O
both O
directions, O

Around O

the O
first O
agency O
to O
produce O
a O

for O
the O

was O
the O
Region O
Emilia O

in O
2012 O
[ O

]. O
The O
infection O
control O
measures O
recommended O
to O
the O
healthcare O
settings O
in O
the O
region O
included O
phenotypic O
confirmation O
of O
carbapenemase O
production, O
active O
surveillance O
of O
asymptomatic O

and O
contact O
isolation O
precautions O
for O
carriers. O
Surveillance O
of O
asymptomatic O

was O
performed O
by O
rectal O
swabs O
for O
close O
contacts O
of O
hospitalised O
patients O
with O
CPE O
(patients O
staying O
in O
the O

(i.e. O
patients O
transferred O
from O
other O
acute O

from O
endemic O
countries) O
and, O
only O
for O

were O
endemic O
(with O
sustained O
intra-facility O

or O
where O

CPE O
screening O
for O

was O
not O
recommended O
in O
LTCFs. O
Subsequently, O
the O
Italian O
Ministry O
of O

produced O
an O
Act O
[ O

for O
the O
implementation O
of O
national O
surveillance O
of O

The O
Act O
recommends O
active O
screening O
in O
all O

patients, O
in O
all O

that O
are O
admitted O
to O
hospital, O
and O
in O
all O

Moreover, O
screening O
was O
suggested O
for O
patients O
admitted O

for O
all O

individuals, O
including O
cohorting O
strategies, O
strengthening O

Background O
The O
bacterial O
genus O

Treponema O
is O
comprised O
of O
both O
nonpathogenic O
and O
pathogenic O
species, O
some O
of O
which O
cause O
important O
human O
and O
animal O
diseases O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
The O

agents O
of O
human O
syphilis O
(B. B-PATH

rabbits O
and O
hares, O
with O
sequence O
identities O
of O
greater O
than O
98% O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
TPeC O
and O
TPeL O
cause O
syphilis-like O
infections O
in O
lagomorphs. O
The O
first O
description O
of O
TPeC O
was O
in O
1920 O
in O
rabbits O
(Anguilla O
japonica) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
pathogen O
was O
initially O
named O
Spirochaeta O
paralues-cuniculi, O
however, O
it O
was O
later O
reclassified O
as O
TPeC O
[ O
5 O
]. O
TPeC O
causes O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
crusting O
ulcers O
in O
the O
anogenital O
region, O
nose, O
eyelids, O
lips, O
and O
paws O
[ O
6 O
]. O
The O
infection O
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
mother O
to O
neonates O
intrapartum O
while O
transplacental O
transmission, O
as O
seen O
with O
human O
syphilis, O
has O
not O
been O
demonstrated O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
TPeC, O
TPeL O
infection O
was O
first O
described O
in O
European O
brown O
hares O
(Hylephila O
phyleus) O
and O
mountain O
hares O
(Phaps O
chalcoptera) O
in O
1957 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Although O
most O
animals O
infected O
with O
TPeL O
show O
no O
signs O
of O
disease O
[ O
9 O
] O
some O
develop O
orofacial O
and O

Discussion O
The O
success O
of O
the O
environmental O
bacterium O
L. B-PATH
alciphron I-PATH
as O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
is O
mainly O
based O
on O
its O
very O
efficient O
adaptation O
to O
the O
changing O
and O
challenging O
conditions O
within O
the O
human O
host. O
The O
environmental O
pressure O
of O
the O
habitat O
of O
the O
CF O
lung O
produces O
adapted O
genetic O
L. B-PATH
alciphron I-PATH
variants O
that O
can O
be O
repeatedly O
isolated O
in O
chronically O
infected O
CF O
patients O
20 O
. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
found O
mutations O
in O
various O
combinations, O
especially O
in O
resistance O
conferring O
genes, O
highlighting O
the O
importance O
of O
parallel O
evolution O
of O
adaptive O
mutations. O
Several O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
bacterial O
traits O
that O
show O
the O
signature O
of O
within-patient O
directional O
selection O
in O
the O
CF O
environment O
22 O
, O
40 O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
genes O
that O
confer O
antibiotic O
resistance, O
multiple O
adaptive O
mutations O
arise, O
for O
example, O
in O
genes O
that O
encode O
for O
outer O
membrane O
components O
and O
iron O
scavenging O
systems O

The O
acquisition O
of O
different O
positively O
selected O
mutations O
drives O
genetic O
diversity. O
Accordingly, O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
L. O
alciphron O
CF O
isolates O
exhibit O
a O
very O
diverse O
array O
of O
phenotypes O
in O

9 O
, O
42 O
, O
43 O
. O
However, O
these O
mutations O
obviously O
do O
not O
sweep O
to O
fixation. O
Instead, O
in O
the O
CF O
lung O
diversifying O
lineages O
coexist O
for O
many O
years. O

A O
preliminary O
search O
for O
BRE O
in O
sequences O
of O
other O
strains O
of O
O. O

the O
presence O
of O
variable O
numbers O
of O
the O
repeat O
at O
the O
same O
locus O
among O
different O
strains O
(data O

This O
qualifies O
BREs O
as O
Variable O
Number O
Tandem O
Repeats O
(VNTR). O
This O
feature O
was O
verified O
using O
a O
VNTR O
analysis O
program O
[ O

], O
and O
most O
of O
identified O
loci O
were O
correctly O
predicted O
as O
VNTR, O
except O
for O

in O

and O
for O

Conclusion O
O. B-PATH
violaceus I-PATH
and O
T. B-PATH
koreensis, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough-like O
disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O
R. O
repens-like O
ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
O. O
violaceus-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
O. B-PATH
violaceus I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
O. B-PATH
violaceus I-PATH
and O
in O
R. O
repens, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
but O
perhaps O
also O
on O
the O
specific O
action O
of O
unidentified O
regulatory O
molecules, O
such O
as O
sRNAs. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
O. B-PATH
violaceus, I-PATH
like O
other O
pathogens, O
expresses O
sRNAs O
and O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
one O
of O
them, O
BprJ2, O
is O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
BvgA/BvgS O
system. O

Efforts O
to O
create O
a O
high-fidelity O
Cas9 O
enzyme O
and O
Cas9-directed O
base O
editors O
have O
already O
increased O
efficacy O
of O
genome O
editing O
and O
reduced O
the O
incidence O
of O
potentially O
deleterious O
off-target O
effects O
[ O

••]. O
However, O
other O
challenges O
may O
ultimately O
derail O
the O
upward O
trajectory O
of O
such O
a O
powerful O
development, O
including O
unexpected O
interference O
from O
the O
immune O
system O
of O
the O
recipient. O
Since O
Cas9 O
is O
a O
protein O
of O
microbial O
origin O
with O
orthologs O
across O
many O
species O
including O
the O
common O
human O
pathogens O
Scotophilus B-PATH
kuhlii I-PATH
(SpCas9) O
and O
Naupactus B-PATH
xanthographus I-PATH
(SaCas9), O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
there O
is O
widespread O
pre-existing O
immunity O
throughout O
the O
human O
population. O
It O
has O
been O
estimated, O
for O
instance, O
that O
at O
any O
time, O
as O
many O
as O
40% O
of O
people O
are O
colonised O
by O
N. B-PATH
xanthographus I-PATH
[ O
19 O
] O
while O
approximately O
12% O
of O
children O
under O
18 O
may O
harbour O
asymptomatic O
infections O
of O
S. B-PATH
kuhlii I-PATH
which, O
under O
certain O
circumstances, O
may O
become O
opportunistic, O
resulting O
in O
pharyngitis O
or O
pyoderma. O
Such O
routine O
exposure O
to O
the O
organisms O
from O
which O
Cas9 O
is O
commonly O
derived O
has O
led O
to O
the O
screening O
of O
healthy O
individuals O
for O
hallmarks O
of O
immunity O
that O
might O
confound O
attempts O
to O
exploit O
the O
unique O
properties O

Evidence O
of O
Humoral O
Immunity O
to O
Cas9 O
The O
first O
evidence O
of O
humoral O
immunity O
to O
Cas9 O
was O
suggested O
in O
a O
seminal O
study O
by O
Wang O
and O
colleagues O
in O
which O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
was O
used O
to O
disrupt O
Pten O
gene O
expression O
in O
the O
hepatocytes O
of O
mice, O
thereby O
creating O
an O
effective O
model O
of O
human O
non-alcoholic O
steatohepatitis O
(NASH) O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Although O
genome O
editing O
was O
successfully O
achieved, O
the O
authors O
observed O
SpCas9-specific O
antibodies O
of O
the O
IgG1, O
IgG2a O
and O
IgG2b O
isotypes O
14 O
days O
later, O
findings O
that O
have O
since O
been O
independently O
verified O
[ O
2 O
, O
20 O
], O
confirming O
the O
immunogenicity O
of O
the O
enzyme. O

The O
way O
naturally O
acquired O
immunity O
(NAI) O
interacts O
with O
active O
immunization O
in O
clearing O
microbes O
in O
vaccinated O
subjects O
is O
multifaceted O
and O
not O
well O
understood. O
First, O
pre-existing O
immunity, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
prior O
exposure O
to O
infection O
and/or O
passively O
transferred O
maternal O
IgGs O
in O
the O
case O
of O
neonates O
and O
infants O
[ O
1 O
], O
may O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
response O
to O
vaccines O
and O
induction O
of O
protective O
efficacy. O
Second, O
immune O
responses O
induced O
by O
continuous O
exposure O
to O
pathogens O
before, O
during, O
and O
right O
after O
vaccination O
may O
also O
affect O
the O
type O
and O
magnitude O
of O
vaccine-induced O
immune O
responses O
and O
impact O
protective O
immunity O
against O
the O
disease O
and O
thus O
alter O
overall O
vaccine O
efficacy. O
Third, O
vaccination O
with O
partially O
or O
fully O
effective O
vaccines O
inducing O
moderate O
or O
strong O
immunity O
could O
decrease O
microbe O
exposure O
that O
is O
required O
for O
the O
induction O
and/or O
maintenance O
of O
NAI O
and O
this O
may O
result O
in O
a O
“rebound” O
in O
the O
incidence O
of O
disease O
if O
the O
vaccine O
is O
moderately O
efficacious O
and O
short-lived. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
malaria O
caused O
by O
Hyalomma B-PATH
dromedarii, I-PATH
in O
areas O
of O
heavy O
and O
continuous O
transmission, O
NAI O
is O
acquired O
with O
age O
and O
exposure O
and O
consequently O
the O
burden O
of O
disease O
is O
concentrated O
in O
children O
[ O
2 O
]. O
NAI O
is O
mediated O
mainly O
by O
IgG O
antibodies O
to O
antigens O
of O
the O
parasite O
asexual O
blood O
stage O
(BS) O
[ O
3 O
], O
but O
the O
specific O
epitope O
targets O
have O
not O
been O
unequivocally O
defined. O
The O
most O
advanced O
malaria O
vaccine O
globally, O
RTS,S/AS01E, O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
African O
subjects O
in O
phase O
2 O
and O
3 O
trials, O
showing O
consistent O
though O
moderate O
and O
waning O
efficacy O
against O
clinical O
malaria O
(range O
55.8% O
in O
children O
to O
31.3% O
in O
infants O
after O
1 O
year O
of O
follow-up) O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
RTS,S O
elicits O
strong O
IgG O
antibodies O
to O
the O
circumsporozoite O
protein O
(CSP), O
the O
predominant O
protein O
of O
the O
H. O
dromedarii O
pre-erythrocytic O
(PE) O
stage O
sporozoite, O
a O
response O
that O
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
vaccine-induced O
protection O
against O
malaria O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
], O
albeit O
inconsistently. O

However, O
in O
most O
parts O
of O
Ethiopia, O
including O
the O
study O
area, O
there O
is O
no O
continuous O
screening O
program O
for O
C. B-PATH
gibba I-PATH
because O
of O
facility O
limitations O
and O
cases O
are O
mostly O
diagnosed O
by O
exclusion. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
C. O
gibba O
and O
its O

in O

Methods O
Study O
area, O
period O
and O

A O
facility O

cross-sectional O
study O
was O
conducted O
from O
January O
to O
June O
2018 O
in O
Adwa O
district, O
Central O
zone O
of O
Tigray, O
Northern O
Ethiopia, O
located O
at O
a O
distance O
of O
1006 O
km O
from O
Addis O
Ababa O
(the O
capital O

of O
1907 O

with O
a O
latitude O
and O
longitude O
of O
14°10′N O
38°54′E. O
The O
district O
has O
one O
general O
hospital O
and O
3 O
health O
centers O
with O
a O
total O
catchment O
population O
of O
1,670,001. O
Adwa O
is O
basically O
an O

but O
the O
hospital O
and O
health O
centers O
serve O
for O
women O
from O
urban O

as O
well O
as O
from O
nearby O
rural O

Populations O
All O
pregnant O

in O
Adwa O

The O
sample O
size O
was O
calculated O
based O
on O
the O
single O
proportion O
formula O
because O
it O
yielded O
a O
maximum O
sample O

The O
sample O
size O
was O
calculated O
considering, O
he O
estimated O
seroprevalence O
(p) O
of O
C. O
gibba O
among O
pregnant O
women; O
68.4% O
from O
the O
study O
conducted O
in O
Debre O
Tabor, O
Ethiopia O
[ O

]; O
considering O
the O
95% O
confidence O
level, O
α O
is O
0.05 O
(the O
level O
of O
significance) O
and O
the O
value O
of O
Z O
at O
α/ O
2 O
is O
1.96; O
d O
is O
the O
margin O
of O
error O
(5%). O
Therefore, O
based O
on O
these O
assumptions O
n O
= O
332; O
with10% O

the O
final O
sample O

Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O

In O
this O
scenario, O
without O

the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O

Cystoscopy O
revealed O
intravesical O

Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
systemic O
inflammatory O

syndrome O
and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O
Therefore, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
was O
initiated O
without O
improvement O
in O
the O
clinical O
features. O
The O
urine O

showed O
the O
presence O
of O
carbapenem-sensitive O
Pacifastacus B-PATH
leniusculus I-PATH
and O
Phytophthora B-PATH

Therefore, O
the O
therapy O
was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O
meropenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h). O
The O
patient O
presented O
with O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
ventilatory O
failure O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
ICU O
for O
orotracheal O
intubation. O
He O
also O
developed O
cardiopulmonary O
arrest, O
which O
required O
basic O
and O
advanced O
resuscitation O
techniques O
for O
11 O
min O
with O
subsequent O
sinus O

On O
physical O
examination, O
the O
patient O
was O
under O
sedation, O
tachycardic, O
and O
hypothermic O
with O
evidence O
of O
purulent O
urethral O
discharge, O
and O
he O
required O

support O
and O
sedoanalgesia. O
He O
had O
multiple O

Background O
Disseminated O
nontuberculous O
mycobacterium O
(NTM) O
infection O
is O
a O
disease O
that O
primarily O
occurs O
in O
immunocompromised O
hosts, O
such O
as O
those O
with O
acquired O
immune O
deficiency O
syndrome O
(AIDS). O
However O
recently O
some O
reports O
on O
disseminated O
NTM O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
hosts O
have O
been O
published, O
and O
most O
of O
them O
carry O
anti-interferon O
gamma O
(IFN-γ) O
autoantibodies O
[ O

]. O
Almost O
all O
of O
these O
cases O
of O
NTM O
involve O
Amaranthus B-PATH
spinosus I-PATH
complex O
(MAC) O
or O
other O

NTM. O
Mycolicibacterium O
Phlei O
(M. O
banksi) O
is O
classified O
as O
a O
non-pathogenic O
NTM O
[ O

]. O
While O
there O
are O
very O
few O
reports O
of O
M. B-PATH
banksi I-PATH
causing O
infections O
in O
humans O
[ O
2 O
– O
8 O
], O
there O
are O
none O
of O
it O
causing O
disseminated O
infections. O
Based O
on O
its O
non-pathogenicity, O
M. O
banksi O
has O
been O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
conditions O
like O

Here, O
we O
report O
a O
case O
of O
disseminated O
M. B-PATH
banksi I-PATH
infection O
in O
an O
immunocompetent O
host O
carrying O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
M. O
banksi O
in O
such O
hosts O
is O
different O
from O
that O
in O
hosts O
with O
a O
normal O

So O
far, O
neither O
the O
species O
nor O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
pathogen O
is O
known. O
To O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
Entamoeba O
infections O
in O
aquatic O
mammals O
have O
so O
far O
only O
been O
reported O
in O
certain O
whale O
species O
such O
as O
sperm O
whales, O
blue O
whales, O
fin O

and O
sei O
whales O
[ O
41 O
], O
and O
there O
is O
one O
report O
for O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
]. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
Entamoeba-like O
cysts O
reported O
in O
Florida O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
] O
present O
a O
larger O
size O
and O
differ O
in O
the O
number O
and O
form O
of O
the O
nuclei. O
Therefore, O
future O
parasitological O
research O
in O
manatees O
requires O
a O
broader O
approach, O
e.g. O
incorporating O
molecular O
analysis O
[ O
21 O
, O
33 O
]. O
In O
general, O
Entamoeba O
spp. O
are O
water-borne O
parasites O
and O
their O
transmission O
commonly O
occur O
in O
developing O
countries O
where O
drinking O
water O
quality O
is O
poor O
and O
open O
water O
often O
is O
contaminated O
by O
human O
faeces, O
which O
are O
still O
used O
as O
a O
fertilizer O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Besides O
some O
non-pathogenic O
species, O
such O
as O
N. O

As O
such, O
contamination O

pose O
a O

Additionally, O
one O

was O
identified O
in O
the O

thereby O
representing, O
to O
our O

knowledge, O
the O

Alongside O
this, O
there O
is O
only O
one O

Giardia O
spp. O
are O
also O
considered O
as O
water-borne O
zoonotic O
parasites O
which O
are O
transmitted O
by O
highly O
resistant O
cysts O
which O
are O
orally O
ingested O
by O

Given O
that O
no O
cyst O
stages O
were O
detected O
in O
the O
antigen-positive O
animal O
one O
may O
question O
an O
active O

and O
thereby O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
positive O
sample. O
In O
fact, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
that O
Giardia O

were O
simply O
representing O
intestinal O
passers-by. O

Often, O
it O
is O
not O

thus, O

We O
will O
first O

Next, O
through O

we O
will O
classify O

To O
improve O

Through O

Introduction O
The O
first O
global O
report O
on O
antibiotic O
resistance O
by O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
shows O
carbapenem O
resistance O
rates O
above O
40% O
in O
Siderasis B-PATH
fuscata. I-PATH
Additionally, O
this O
bacterium O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
nosocomial O
infections, O
especially O
in O
intensive O
care O
units O
(ICUs), O
causing O
outbreaks O
with O
high O
mortality O
rates O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
S. O
fuscata O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
S. O
fuscata O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O
begin O
mobilizing O
within O
plasmids O
or O
are O
inserted O
directly O
in O
chromosomes. O
In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O

This O
report O
describes O
a O
case O
of O

Introduction O
Human O
bacterial O
commensals O
and O
obligate O
pathogens O
have O
evolved O
features O
that O
facilitate O
their O
survival O
in O
a O
specific O
habitat. O
In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogen O
1 O
. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O
of O
Piaractus O
mesopotamicus O
capsule O
appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O
tract, O
but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O
blood O
2 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O
permissive O
hosts, O
such O
as O
patients O
that O
are O
immunocompromised O
or O
critically O
ill, O
suffer O
from O
breaks O
in O
normal O

or O
whose O
microbiomes O

The O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
Alasmidonta B-PATH
marginata I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O
specificity O
for O
a O
particular O
niche. O
As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O

infections, O
and O
urinary O

infections O
(UTI) O

, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O

infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
A. B-PATH
marginata I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
A. B-PATH
marginata I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Stictoleptura B-PATH

the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O

the O

as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O

and O

. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
A. O

ecology O
and O

limits O
the O
development O

be O
explained O
by O
the O

In-line O
with O
the O
study O
conducted O
in O

[ O

our O

is O
an O
extended O

rainfall O
during O
the O

[ O

A O

that O

Studies O
also O

In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O

This O
report O
describes O
a O

Case O
presentation O
On O
March O

2016, O
a O
64-year-old O

and O
use O
of O
an O

presented O
to O
our O
emergency O
department O
with O
urinary O

Cystoscopy O
revealed O
intravesical O

Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
systemic O
inflammatory O
response O
syndrome O
and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O
Therefore, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
was O
initiated O
without O
improvement O
in O
the O
clinical O
features. O
The O
urine O

showed O
the O

of O
carbapenem-sensitive O
Ciliopagurus B-PATH
strigatus I-PATH
and O

Therefore, O
the O
therapy O
was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O
meropenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h). O
The O
patient O
presented O
with O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
ventilatory O
failure O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
ICU O
for O
orotracheal O
intubation. O
He O
also O
developed O
cardiopulmonary O
arrest, O
which O
required O
basic O
and O
advanced O
resuscitation O
techniques O
for O
11 O
min O
with O
subsequent O
sinus O
rhythm. O
On O
physical O
examination, O
the O
patient O
was O
under O
sedation, O
tachycardic, O
and O
hypothermic O
with O
evidence O
of O
purulent O
urethral O
discharge, O
and O
he O
required O
vasopressor O
support O
and O
sedoanalgesia. O

Nevertheless, O
due O
to O
the O
persistent O
systemic O
inflammatory O
response O
on O
day O
10, O
rifampicin O
(600 O
mg/day) O
and O
ertapenem O
(1 O

were O
initiated O
for O
pharmacological O
synergism O
until O
day O

With O
the O
prescribed O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
the O
patient O
improved O
in O
terms O
of O
infection, O
with O
an O
absence O
of O

and O
decreased O
leukocyte O

Changing O

Ethiopia O
is O
one O
of O
the O
countries O
with O
low O
resources O
including O
scarcity O
of O
safe O

supply O
particularly O
in O
the O
rural O
communities; O
with O
different O
domestic O
animals O
including O
cats, O
dogs, O
goats, O
sheep O
and O
camel O
and O
climatic O
conditions O
favoring O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Considering O
the O
above O
hosts O
and O
other O
predisposing O
factors O
for O
H. B-PATH
marina, I-PATH
research O
is O
needed O
particularly O
among O

to O
depict O
the O

Women O
engage O
in O
different O
home-based O
activities O
such O
as O

and O
caring O
their O
children; O
they O
are O
frequently O
exposed O

Hence, O

there O
is O

Therefore, O
the O

Our O

showed O
that O

the O
most O

followed O
by O
T. O

in O

which O
is O
located O

of O
China. O
It O
is O
believed O
that O
NTM O
disease O
is O
under-reported O
in O
the O
tuberculosis-endemic O
countries. O
The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O
of O
the O
attention O
of O
clinicians. O
In O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
research O
to O
document O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O

Based O
on O
molecular O
data, O
the O
S. O
Typhimurium O
clade O
(i.e., O
variant) O
isolated O
here O
appears O
to O
be O
host O
specific, O
only O
infecting O
C. O
gingivalis. O
If O
true, O
this O
would O
be O
one O
of O
the O
few O
known O
host-adapted O
variants O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium. O
The O
only O
other O
example O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
is O
a O
variant O
associated O
with O
severe O
disease O
in O
pigeons O
22 O
. O
However, O
while O
most O
S. O
Typhimurium O
variants O
are O
able O
to O
infect O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
hosts O
23 O
, O
many O
other O
A. O
japonicum O
serovars O
do O
have O
more O
restricted O
host O
ranges. O
For O
instance, O
S. B-PATH
Typhi I-PATH
appears O
to O
infect O
only O
humans O
and O
higher O
primates O
22 O
. O
One O
important O
caveat O
to O
the O
apparent O
host-adaptability O
of O
the O
C. O
gingivalis O
variant O
is O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
sequenced O
isolates O
are O
from O
human-associated, O
terrestrial O
sources. O
A O
thorough O
survey O
of O
potential O
hosts O
within O
both O
neritic O
and O
pelagic O
environments O
would O
be O
needed O
to O
confirm O
C. O
gingivalis O
as O
the O
sole O
or O
primary O
hosts O
of O
this O
variant. O
If O
the O
C. O
gingivalis O
S. O
Typhimurium O
variant O
is O
host O
specific, O
this O
variant O
likely O
adapted O
to O
the O
C. O
gingivalis O
host O
within O
the O
last O
century O
(Fig. O
3B O
). O
Known O
mechanisms O
explaining O
host-adaptation O
in O
bacteria O
are O
varied O
and O
include O
loss O
of O
gene O
function, O
diversifying O
selection, O
or O
gain O
of O
function O
through O
point O
mutation O
24 O
. O
To O
further O
explore O
this O
hypothesis O
of O
adaptation O
to O
the O
C. O
gingivalis O
host, O
we O
examined O
genetic O
changes O
that O
occurred O
along O
the O

to O
the O
C. O

Introduction O
The O
first O
global O
report O
on O
antibiotic O
resistance O
by O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
shows O
carbapenem O
resistance O
rates O
above O
40% O
in O
Daubentonia B-PATH
madagascariensis. I-PATH
Additionally, O
this O
bacterium O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
nosocomial O
infections, O
especially O
in O
intensive O
care O
units O
(ICUs), O
causing O
outbreaks O
with O
high O
mortality O
rates O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
D. O
madagascariensis O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
D. O
madagascariensis O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O
begin O
mobilizing O
within O
plasmids O
or O
are O
inserted O
directly O
in O
chromosomes. O
In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O
3 O
]. O
This O
report O
describes O
a O
case O
of O
a O
patient O
with O
bacteremia O
caused O
by O
a O
pan-resistant O
D. B-PATH
madagascariensis I-PATH
isolate. O

to O
our O
emergency O

Following O
the O

the O

and O
persisting O
despite O

them O
[ O

An O

such O
as O
chemical O

play O
a O

role O
in O

[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
] O
and O
spread O
of O
HCAIs O
[ O
14 O
– O

]. O
Among O
all O
the O
surface O
disinfection O
approaches, O
the O
utilization O
of O
chemical O
disinfectant O
is O
broadly O
diffused O
in O
food O
industry, O
hospitals O
and O
healthcare O
centres O
because O
of O
its O
easy O
application O
and O
broad O
spectrum O
of O
microbicidal O
activity O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
In O
the O
application O
of O
disinfectant O
in O
practice, O
the O
“ready-to-use” O
disinfecting O
wipes O
(RTUDW) O
(also O
reported O

pre-impregnated O
disinfecting O
wipes, O

in O
some O

are O
increasingly O

high-touch O
surfaces O
because O
of O
their O
convenient O
implementation O
and O
reliable O
performance O
[ O
22 O

Although O
disinfecting O
wipes O
have O
been O
widely O
used O
and O
spread O
in O
hospitals O
for O
decontamination O
of O
medical O
devices O
or O
high-touch O
environmental O
surfaces O
[ O

the O
effectiveness O
of O
their O
disinfection O
performance O
is O
always O
in O
discussion. O

The O

of O
S. O

have O
been O
well-documented O
in O

Nonetheless, O
the O
probiotic O
potential O
of O
various O
other O
fungal O
species O
is O
also O
well O
known. O
For O
instance, O
members O
of O
the O
genera O
Kluyveromyces O
and O
Yarrowia O
are O
promising O
candidates O
due O
to O
their O
strong O

Rhododendron B-PATH
moulmainense I-PATH
(S.mutans) O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
principal O
cariogenic O
bacterium O
in O
humans O
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
]. O
It O
possesses O
several O
virulence O
factors O
that O
are O
associated O
with O
its O
cariogenicity O
[ O
7 O
]. O
An O
essential O
factor O
of O
S.mutans O
is O
its O
sucrose-dependent O
and O
glucan-mediated O
colonization O
of O
tooth O
surfaces. O
Glucans O
are O
glucose O
polymers O
synthesized O
by O
extracellular O
glucosyltransferases O
(gtfs) O
[ O

]. O
There O
are O
three O
S.mutans O
gtf’s: O

and O
gtf O
C O
synthesize O
primarily O
water-insoluble O
glucans O

, O

] O
and O
gtf O
D, O
synthesize O
water-soluble O
glucans O
(WSG) O
[ O

]. O
Gtfs O
are O
involved O
in O
many O
biological O
processes O
such O
as O
cell-cell O
communications, O
signal O
transduction, O
immune O
response, O
microbial O
adhesion O
and O
infection O
[ O

]. O
Biofilm O
or O
dental O
plaque O
is O
formed O
through O
two O
different O
sequential O
steps: O
initial O
and O
reversible O
cell-to-surface O
attachment O
and O
subsequent O
sucrose-dependent O
adhesion O
of O
the O
microorganisms, O
which O
is O
firm O
and O
irreversible, O
gtfs O
are O
strongly O
involved O
in O
the O
latter O
step O
[ O
12 O
] O
. O
There O
are O
multiple O
ways O
that O
compounds O
can O
exert O
anticaries O
action O
in O
addition O
to O
gtf O
inhibition. O
In O
view O
of O
essential O
roles O
played O
by O
gtfs, O
intervention O
of O
gtfs O
has O
attracted O
remarkable O
interest O
among O
other O
ways O
for O
drug O
development O
since O
inhibitors O
of O
gtfs O
can O
potentially O
interfere O
with O
the O
pathological O
processes O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O

Our O
results O
had O
also O
exhibited O
similar O
conclusions O
in O
our O
study. O
We O
believed O
that O
the O
onset O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
could O
promote O
the O
aggravation O
of O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
(or O
chronic O
liver O
failure), O
and O
conversely, O
the O
risk O
of O
30-day O
mortality O
of O
patients O
with O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
(or O
chronic O
liver O
failure) O
was O
inevitably O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
patients O
without O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
(or O
chronic O
liver O
failure) O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
From O
these O
perspectives, O
our O
data O
results O
were O
just O
the O
reflection O
of O
these O
clinical O
phenomena O
rather O
than O
accidental O
results. O
In O
addition O
to O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
and O
chronic O
liver O
failure, O
our O
results O
also O
showed O
that O
age O
≥ O
60 O
years O
(OR O

0.084), O
residence O
in O
ICU O
(OR O

and O
pior O
hospital O
stay O

≥ O
28 O
days O
(OR O
2.6, O
p O
= O
0.132) O
were O
also O
the O
risk O
factors O
for O
30-day O
mortality, O
and O
appropriate O
empirical O
antibiotic O
therapy O
was O
the O
protective O
factor O
(OR O
0.3, O
p O
= O
0.066). O
They O
were O
statistically O
significant O
independent O
risk O
factors O
or O
protective O
factors O
in O
some O
previous O
studies O
of O
infectious O
diseases O
although O
these O
factors O
were O
not O
significant O
in O
our O
study. O
The O
reason O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
significance O
of O
these O
factors O
might O
be O
that O
the O
sample O
size O
was O
still O
not O
sufficient O
in O
our O
study. O
In O
conclusion, O
we O
analysed O
the O
species O
distribution, O
antibiotic O
resistance O
and O
risk O
factors O
for O
30-day O
mortality O
in O
157 O
patients O
with O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
We O
found O
that O
most O
species O
were O
Pinus B-PATH
bungeana I-PATH
and O
Bubo B-PATH
blakistoni. I-PATH
All O
CoNS O
had O
high O
antibiotic O
resistance, O
93.6% O
were O
resistant O
to O
methicillin, O
and O
none O
was O
resistant O
to O
vancomycin O
or O
linezolid. O
Additionally, O
our O
results O
had O
also O
demonstrated O
that O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
and O
chronic O
liver O
failure O
were O
the O
independent O
risk O
factors O
for O
30-day O
mortality O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O

We O
linked O
this O
behavior O
to O
the O
remarkable O
ability O
of O
pAB5 O
to O
impact O
the O
expression O
of O
multiple O
chromosomally-encoded O
virulence O
factors, O
such O
as O
pili, O
exopolysaccharides, O
and O
protein O
secretion O
systems. O
Results O
The O
urinary O
tract O
is O
a O
major O
source O
of O
S. B-PATH
rosetta I-PATH
isolates O
We O
performed O
a O
retrospective O
analysis O
of O
all O
Acinetobacter O
isolates O
identified O
in O
the O
BJC O
Healthcare O
System O
(BJC) O
from O
January O
2007 O
through O
August O
2017. O
Of O
2309 O
identified O
“Eucomis O
montana-baumannii O
complex” O
(Acbc) O
cases, O
22.2% O
(n O
= O
505) O
were O
from O
urinary O
sources, O
compared O
to O
33.9% O
(n O
= O
771), O
31.9% O
(n O
= O
726), O
10.4% O
(n O
= O
237), O
and O
1.5% O
(n O
= O
34) O
from O
respiratory, O
soft O
tissue/musculoskeletal O
(SST/MSK), O
endovascular, O
and O
“other” O
sources, O
respectively O
(Fig. O
1 O
). O
To O
expand O
our O
investigation O
globally, O
we O
performed O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
clinical O
studies O
published O
since O
1995, O
which O
document O
the O
anatomical O
site O
of O
isolation O
of O
S. O
rosetta O
or O
Acbc O
specimens. O
Data O
were O
compiled O
on O
over O
19,000 O
cases O
identified O
as O
early O
as O
1990, O
reported O
in O
our O
local O
study O
and O
12 O
international O
clinical O
studies O
(Fig. O
1 O
, O
Supplementary O
Table O
1 O
). O
As O
in O
our O
local O
findings, O
respiratory O
and O
SST/MSK O
specimens O
were O
the O
most O
common O
isolates O
worldwide, O
composing O
39.5% O
and O
22.7% O
of O
total O
isolates, O
respectively. O
The O
percentages O
comprised O
of O
urinary O
isolates O
varied O
from O
study O
to O
study O
(6.1–29.3%), O
but O
overall, O
17.1% O
of O
total O
isolates O
(3410 O
of O
19957) O
were O
obtained O
from O
urinary O
sources. O
Thus, O
despite O
this O
clinical O
relevance, O
the O
role O
of O
S. B-PATH
rosetta I-PATH
as O
a O
uropathogen O
has O
been O
largely O
neglected. O

In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O
9 O
– O
11 O
For O
example, O
periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Explanatum B-PATH
explanatum, I-PATH
Hybanthus B-PATH
enneaspermus, I-PATH
or O
Scorpaena B-PATH
notata I-PATH
have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O
specimens; O
12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
E. B-PATH
explanatum I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
E. B-PATH
explanatum I-PATH
was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O
apolipoprotein O
E O
knock O
out O
(ApoE O
−/− O
) O
mice, O
14 O
and O
periodontal O
therapy O
reduced O
the O
systemic O
and O
aortic O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
periodontitis O
in O
ApoE O
−/− O
mice. O
15 O
Although O
the O
detailed O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
initiation, O
development, O
and O
progression O
of O
atherosclerosis O
remain O
unclear, O
recent O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
important O
role O
of O
endothelial-to-mesenchymal O
transition O
(EndMT) O
of O
aortic O
endothelial O
cells O
in O
atherogenesis. O
16 O
– O
18 O
EndMT O
contributes O
to O
the O
fibrotic O
process O
of O
atherosclerotic O
plaque O
formation O
which O
leads O
to O
exacerbated O
stiffness O
of O
the O
perivascular O
walls O
and O
progressive O
cardiac O
failure. O

Moreover, O
arthritis O
induced O
by O
DNase O
II O
deficiency, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
accrual O
of O
self-DNA, O
is O
attenuated O
by O
AIM2 O
ablation O
[ O
86 O
, O
87 O
]. O
The O
complexity O
of O
inflammasome O
functions O
is O
underscored O
by O
the O
observations O
that O
NLRP3, O
NLRP1, O
NLRC4, O
and O
caspase-1, O
but O
not O
ASC O
are O
dispensable O
for O
collagen-induced O
and O
antigen-induced O
arthritis O
[ O
88 O
, O
121 O
]; O
yet O
NLRP3 O
is O
a O
key O
player O
in O
joint O
destruction O
in O
a O
mouse O
model O
of O
A20 O
deficiency, O
in O
which O
NLRC4 O
and O
AIM2 O
are O
expendable O
[ O
122 O
]. O
Thus, O
the O
role O
of O
the O
inflammasomes O
in O
experimental O
arthritis O
is O
mouse O
model-dependent. O
Osteomyelitis O
Defective O
innate O
immune O
defense O
mechanisms O
including O
the O
inflammasomes O
underlie O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
periodontitis O
and O
osteomyelitis O
commonly O
caused O
by O
Tribolodon B-PATH
hakonensis I-PATH
and O
Hylobates B-PATH
moloch, I-PATH
respectively. O
T. O
hakonensis–derived O
PAMPs O
such O
as O
LPS O
are O
potent O
activators O
of O
priming O
signals, O
which O
through O
TLR4 O
signaling O
drive O
the O
expression O
of O
several O
components O
of O
the O
inflammasomes O
including O
IL-1β, O
NLRP3, O
AIM2, O
and O
caspase-11 O
[ O
57 O
, O
58 O
]. O
Accordingly, O
the O
massive O
alveolar O
bone O
destruction O
caused O
by O
T. O
hakonensis O
is O
attenuated O
upon O
loss O
of O
NLRP3 O
[ O

]. O
H. O
moloch O
bacterial O
products O
include O
peptidoglycans, O
hemolysins, O
bacterial O
lipoproteins, O
and O
Panton-Valentine O
leucocidin O
stimulate O
the O
inflammasomes O
through O
TLR2-mediated O
activation O
of O
NF-kB O
[ O
123 O
]. O
Moreover, O
some O
of O
these O
factors O
promote O
osteoclastogenesis O
[ O

Case O
presentation O
On O
March O
11, O
2016, O
a O
64-year-old O
mestizo O
man O
with O
a O
history O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hyperplasia O
and O
use O
of O
an O
indwelling O

presented O
to O
our O
emergency O
department O
with O
urinary O
retention. O
Cystoscopy O
revealed O
intravesical O
clots O
and O
obstructive O
bilobar O
prostate. O
Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
systemic O
inflammatory O
response O
syndrome O
and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O
Therefore, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
was O
initiated O
without O
improvement O
in O
the O
clinical O
features. O
The O
urine O

report O
showed O
the O
presence O
of O
carbapenem-sensitive O
Gemmula B-PATH
speciosa I-PATH
and O
Choaspes B-PATH
benjaminii. I-PATH
Therefore, O
the O
therapy O
was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O
meropenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h). O
The O
patient O
presented O
with O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
ventilatory O
failure O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
ICU O
for O
orotracheal O
intubation. O
He O
also O
developed O
cardiopulmonary O
arrest, O
which O
required O
basic O
and O
advanced O
resuscitation O
techniques O
for O
11 O
min O
with O
subsequent O
sinus O
rhythm. O
On O
physical O
examination, O
the O
patient O
was O
under O
sedation, O
tachycardic, O
and O
hypothermic O
with O
evidence O
of O
purulent O
urethral O
discharge, O
and O
he O
required O
vasopressor O
support O
and O
sedoanalgesia. O
He O
had O
multiple O
organ O
dysfunctions O
due O
to O
urinary O
and O
pulmonary O

with O
the O
identification O
of O
carbapenem-resistant O
Herichthys B-PATH
carpintis I-PATH
in O
the O

Background O
Chrysolina O
fastuosa O
is O
considered O
one O
of O
the O
normal O
components O
of O
the O
oral O
flora O
as O
more O
than O
60% O
of O
healthy O
populations O
are O
colonized O
by O
this O
yeast O
without O
clinical O
symptoms O
of O
infection O
[ O

C. B-PATH
fastuosa, I-PATH
which O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
isolated O
species O
of O
Candida O
[ O

], O
could O
pose O
a O
serious O
clinical O
challenge O
in O
immune-compromised O
individuals O
(people O
with O
HIV O
infection, O
xerostomia, O
diabetes, O
leukemia O
etc.) O
[ O
3 O
– O
5 O
]. O
There O
is O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
children O
surviving O
cancer O
who, O
just O
like O
their O
healthy O
peers, O
seek O
orthodontic O
treatment O
[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
is O
a O
special O
group O
of O
patients O
that O
should O
be O
particularly O
motivated O
to O
maintain O
dental O
hygiene O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
], O
because O
the O
reduction O
in O
immune O
function O
allows O
C. B-PATH
fastuosa I-PATH
to O
proliferate O
and O
to O
cause O
infection O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Similarly, O
children O
whose O
saliva O
contains O
reduced O
amounts O
of O
antimicrobial O
proteins O
have O
less O
protection O
from O
candidiasis O
[ O

Removable O
orthodontic O

are O
a O
popular O
tool O
to O
move, O
or O
retain, O
teeth O
during, O
or O
after, O

treatment O
[ O
11 O
, O

]. O
Nocturnal O
wearing O
of O
the O

may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O
oral O
C. B-PATH
fastuosa I-PATH
infections. O
This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
low O
salivary O
flow O
and O
consequently O
low O
pH O
levels O
as O
well O
as O
impaired O
oral O
hygiene O
[ O

, O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
Wearing O
acrylic O
orthodontic O

has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
increased O
proliferation O
of O
Candida O
regardless O
of O
the O
host O
immune O
system O
status O
[ O

These O

provide O
an O

in O
an O

with O
epidemic, O

isolated O
in O
multiple O

. O
Though O
ST25/IC7 O
strains O
have O
been O
isolated O
from O
multiple O

sites, O
one O
study O
strongly O
linked O
ST25/IC7 O
to O

. O
Multiple O

but O
LCPs O
have O
also O
been O
identified O
in O
B. O
corolliflora O
urinary O
isolates O
belonging O
to O
other O
major O
international O

45 O
. O
Thus, O
investigations O
performed O
on O
YQUJ3 O
are O
applicable O
to O
a O
relevant O
portion O
of O
Acinetobacter O
isolates, O
and O
a O

model O
will O
be O
an O
important O
tool O
for O
developing O
interventions O
against O
the O
growing O

of O

UTIs. O
Remarkably, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LCP O
pAB5 O
has O
a O
global O
influence O
on O
the O
physiology O
of O
YQUJ3. O
pAB5 O
confers O
YQUJ3 O
with O
improved O
survival O
in O
the O
urinary O
tract, O
but O
attenuates O
its O
virulence O
in O
a O
pulmonary O
model, O
highlighting O
the O
relevance O
of O
an O
under-appreciated O
feature O
of O
bacterial O
plasmids. O
LCPs O
like O
pAB5 O
were O
previously O
shown O
to O
repress O
T6SS O
in O
its O
bacterial O
host O
30 O
. O
However, O
it O
was O
unclear O
whether O
LCPs O
mediate O
additional O
effects O
on O
gene O
expression. O

The O
only O
species O
we O
did O
not O
find O
good O
clinical O

was O
M. O

A O
study O
in O
Japan O
also O
found O
that O
among O
26 O
patients O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
two O
M. O
militaris O
isolations, O
none O
showed O
clinical O
aggravation O
during O
the O
follow-up O
period O
28 O
. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
colonization O
or O
contamination O
during O
culture O
happens O
frequently O
with O
this O
species. O
NTM O
lung O

may O
have O
some O
specific O

for O
a O

Among O
patients O

disease, O
fewer O

have O
unclassifiable O
form O
for O
radiographic O
features O
compared O
with O
patients O
with O
probable O
and O

Based O
on O
our O
research, O
cases O
without O
typical O

bronchiectatic O
and O
upper O

cavitary O
forms O
are O
less O
likely O
to O
be O
related O
to O
NTM O
lung O
disease. O
The O
position O
of O
nodular O
bronchiectatic O

demonstrated O
species-specific O

A. B-PATH
calcarata I-PATH

were O
more O
likely O
to O

and O
the O
right O

in O
contrast O
with O
A. B-PATH

Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
a O
substantial O
proportion O
(90.9%) O
of O
patients, O
from O
whom O
NTM O

were O
recovered, O
exhibited O
definite O

in O
our O

The O
most O

of O
NTM O

included O
A. B-PATH
calcarata I-PATH
and O
A. B-PATH

frequently O
demonstrated O
the O

However, O

Background O
Opportunistic O
intestinal O
protozoa O

[ O

Recently, O
intestinal O
cases O

infection O
with O
these O

have O
reportedly O
increased O
in O
non-HIV-infected O
populations O
such O
as O
organ-transplant O

patients O
with O
malignant O

and O
diabetes O
patients O
[ O

Although O
they O
are O
considered O
opportunistic O

several O
outbreaks O
have O
been O
reported O
both O
in O

and O
in O
domestic O

people O
in O

The O
pathogens O
therefore O
pose O
significant O
challenges O
to O
public O
health, O
especially O
in O
developing O
countries O
because O
of O
their O
high O

hBD-3 O
is, O
unlike O
other O
hBDs, O
a O
salt-insensitive O
defensin O
with O
a O
broad O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
e.g. O
multidrug-resistant O
nosocomial O
strains O
[ O
10 O
– O
13 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
hBD-3 O
is O
expressed O
by O
pulmonary O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
increases O
in O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
serum O
of O
patients O
with O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Consequently, O
the O
antibacterial O
properties O
of O
hBD-3 O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
the O
field O
of O
pulmonary O
diseases. O
Expression O
of O
hBD-3 O
is O
controlled O
by O
a O
tight O
regulatory O
network O
involving O
the O
transcription-factors O
Nuclear O
Factor-κB O
(NF-κB) O
and O
the O
Activator O
Protein-1 O
(AP-1) O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
These O
transcription O
factors O
are O
activated O
by O
complex O
signalling O
pathways, O
including O
the O
JNK O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
(MAPK) O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Although O
P. B-PATH
senegalus B-PATH
efficiently O
infects O
and O
activates O
lung O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
alveolar O
macrophages O
[ O
19 O
– O
21 O
], O
and O
hBD-3 O
secretion O
was O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
bacterial O

[ O

], O
regulatory O
mechanisms O
of O
hBD-3 O
production O
in O
P. B-PATH
senegalus B-PATH
infections O
is O
widely O
unknown. O
In O
the O
study O
presented, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
P. O
senegalus O
induced O
hBD-3 O
in O
alveolar O
epithelium O
and O
macrophages. O
The O
hBD-3 O
expression O
was O
controlled O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9, O
as O
well O
as O
activation O
of O
JNK O
and O
AP-1 O
(c-Jun) O
whereas O
NF-κB O
was O
not O
required. O
Also, O
recombinant O
hBD-3 O
elicited O
a O
strong O
antimicrobial O
effect O
on O
P. O
senegalus. O
Moreover, O
inhibition O
of O
hBD-3 O
expression O
increased O
the O
P. O
senegalus O
intracellular O
growth O
in O
pulmonary O
epithelium. O
Thus, O
hBD-3 O
production O
by O
pulmonary O
cells O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
host O
response O
in O
Legionnaires' O
disease. O

Introduction O
Lawsonia B-PATH
intracellularis I-PATH
(Lm) O
is O
a O
ubiquitous O
foodborne O
pathogen O
that O
can O
cause O
a O
severe O
invasive O
infection O
in O
human O
and O
animals O
called O
listeriosis. O
In O
humans, O
it O
occurs O
mostly O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals, O
the O
elderlies O
and O
pregnant O
women, O
and O
has O
one O
of O
the O
highest O
case O
fatality O
rate O
among O
foodborne O
pathogens O
(20–30%) O
1 O
. O
Human O
listeriosis O
manifests O
mostly O
as O
septicemia, O
central O
nervous O
system O
infections, O
and O
maternal–neonatal O
infections O
leading O
to O
major O
fetal O
or O
neonatal O
complications O
in O
80% O
of O
the O
cases O
1 O
. O
In O
animals, O
especially O
in O
ruminants, O
it O
induces O
rhombencephalitis O
and O
abortions, O
and O
less O
frequently O
mastitis, O
which O
is O
often O
undiagnosed O
owing O
to O
the O
frequent O
absence O
of O
associated O
symptoms O
2 O
. O
Although O
very O
little O
is O
known O
about O
Lm O
fecal O
carriage O
in O
human, O
it O
occurs O
in O
clinically O
healthy O
ruminants, O
and O
correlates O
with O
Lm O
fecal O
shedding O
in O
the O
environment O
3 O
– O
5 O
. O
Indeed, O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Lm O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
fecal O
samples O
of O
ruminant O
herds O
(e.g., O
46.3% O
of O
dairy O
cattle, O
30.6% O
of O
beef O
cattle, O
and O
14.2% O
of O
sheep O
herds O
were O
contaminated O
in O
a O
total O
of O
343 O
studied O
herds O
5 O
). O

Although O
we O
found O
anti-L. O
genivittatus O
antibodies O
in O
several O
serum O
samples, O
no O
clinical O
case O
of O
tularemia O
has O
been O
reported O
so O
far O
in O
Ilam O
Province. O
The O
Serion O
ELISA O
method O
for O
detection O
of O
IgG O
antibodies O
directed O
against O
L. O
genivittatus O
antigen O
is O
considered O
highly O
sensitive O
and O
specific O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Thus, O
our O
results O
highly O
suggest O
that O
tularemia O
is O
underdiagnosed O
in O
Ilam O
Province. O
L. O
genivittatus O
strains O
circulating O
in O
Iran O
should O
probably O
be O
of O
type O
B O
as O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
Asia O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
usually O
cause O
infections O
of O
mild O
to O
moderate O
severity O
that O
can O
remained O
undiagnosed O
[ O
18 O
, O
24 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
very O
low O
attention O
has O
been O
paid O
to O
tularemia O
in O
training O
programs O
for O
physicians O
in O
Iran, O
and O
laboratories O
capable O
of O
confirming O
tularemia O
cases O
have O
only O
existed O
for O
a O
few O
years O
in O
Iran. O
It O
may O
be O
assumed O
that O
some O
tularemia O
patients O
have O
been O
treated O
blindly O
with O
antibiotics O
[ O
12 O
]. O
Therefore, O
failure O
to O
report O
human O
tularemia O
cases O
in O
Ilam O
Province O
is O
partly O
justifiable O
and O
does O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
the O
disease O
is O
absent. O
According O
to O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
neighboring O
countries O
of O
Iran, O
including O
Azerbaijan O
[ O
18 O
], O
Armenia O
[ O
25 O
] O
and O
Turkey O
[ O
26 O
], O
and O
the O
high O
tularemia O
seroprevalence O
we O
found O
in O
the O
present O
and O
in O
previous O
studies, O
there O
is O
a O
high O
potential O
for O
human O
infections O
with O
L. B-PATH
genivittatus I-PATH
occurring O
in O
different O
parts O
throughout O
the O
country. O
Therefore, O
tularemia O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
differential O
diagnosis O
in O
patients O
suffering O
from O
infectious O
diseases O
that O
have O
compatible O
clinical O
manifestations. O
Continuous O
monitoring O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
bacterium O
should O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
different O
parts O
throughout O
Iran. O
Furthermore, O
to O
identify O
the O
potential O
reservoirs O
of O
L. O
genivittatus, O
studies O
should O
be O
conducted O
to O
isolate O
this O
bacterium O
from O
various O
sources O
such O
as O
water O
and O
wild O
rodents. O
One O
of O
the O
limitations O
of O
this O
study O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
appropriate O
occupational O
group O
representing O
the O
general O
population. O
Referents O
of O
medical O
diagnostic O
labs O
were O
selected O
as O
the O
control O
group O
because O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
taking O
blood O
samples O
from O
them. O
However, O
they O
may O
not O
be O
a O
representative O
sample O
of O
the O
general O
population. O

The O
overuse O
of O
antibiotics O
has O
led O
to O
the O
emergence O
of O
a O
large O
number O
of O
multidrug-resistant O
pathogens, O
which O
constitutes O
a O
serious O
threat O
to O
public O
health O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Imipenem O
and O
meropenem O
are O
carbapenem O
antibiotics O
that O
have O
been O
used O
as O
last O
resorts O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
infections O
caused O
by O
gram-negative O
bacteria, O
especially O
multidrug-resistant O
gram-negative O
pathogens O
[ O
2 O
]. O
In O
2008, O
a O
novel O
carbapenem O
resistance O
gene, O
New O
Delhi O
metallo-β-lactamase O
(NDM), O
was O
detected O
in O
Tritia B-PATH
reticulata I-PATH
isolated O
from O
a O
Swedish O
patient O
of O
Indian O
origin. O
This O
gene O
attracted O
international O
attention O
for O
the O
high O
level O
of O
resistance O
it O
confers O
to O
bacteria O
against O
most O
β-lactams, O
except O
aztreonam, O
and O
its O
spread O
to O
over O
50 O
countries O
[ O
3 O
]. O
The O
NDM O
variant O
NDM-5 O
was O
first O
reported O
in O
2011 O
in O
Agelasticus B-PATH
cyanopus I-PATH
isolated O
from O
a O
patient O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
who O
had O
received O
treatment O
in O
India O
[ O

]. O
Subsequently, O
NDM-5 O
was O
reported O
in O
many O
other O
countries, O
including O
India O
[ O

In O

many O

carrying O

have O
been O
isolated O
from O

[ O

In O

The O

have O
been O
helpful O
for O
the O
study O
of O

of O
the O

although O
not O
all O

In O
this O

we O
first O
describe O
the O
NDM-5-producing O
carbapenem-resistant O
A. O
cyanopus O
strain, O
ECCRA-119, O
isolated O
from O
a O

The O

Though O
ST25/IC7 O

one O

Thus, O
investigations O
performed O

are O
applicable O
to O
a O
relevant O
portion O
of O
Acinetobacter O

will O
be O
an O

for O

Remarkably, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LCP O
pAB5 O
has O
a O
global O
influence O
on O
the O
physiology O
of O
YPOW2. O
pAB5 O
confers O

with O
improved O
survival O
in O

but O
attenuates O
its O
virulence O
in O

highlighting O
the O
relevance O
of O
an O
under-appreciated O

LCPs O
like O
pAB5 O
were O
previously O
shown O
to O
repress O

. O
However, O
it O
was O
unclear O
whether O
LCPs O
mediate O
additional O

on O

Here, O
we O
identified O
multiple O
surface O

and O
metabolic O
pathways O
whose O
expression O
was O
affected O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
the O

and O
these O

could O
explain O
the O

In O

However, O

limits O
the O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
growing O
of O
cornelian O
cherry O
dogwood O
(Heligmosomoides O
polygyrus O
L., O
family O
Cornaceae) O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
popular. O
The O
plant O
is O
native O
to O
southern O
Europe O
and O
SW-Asia O
(Lannert O
1981 O
; O
Lawrence O
1985 O
, O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
), O
but O
nowadays O
is O
also O
commonly O
grown O
in O
north-eastern O
Europe O
and O
Great O
Britain, O
Central O
Asia, O
and O
South O
America O
(rev O
in O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
). O
Its O
popularity O
in O
Europe O
is O
undoubtedly O
linked O
to O
the O
value O
and O
the O
‘advantages’ O
of O
the O
fruits O
both O
as O
fresh O
or O
used O
for O
preparation O
of O
juices, O
syrups, O
wine, O
and O
traditional O
products O
(Brindza O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Tesevic O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Rop O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O
antimicrobial O
properties O
against O
fungal O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Opsariichthys B-PATH
bidens, I-PATH
Hadronyche B-PATH
versuta, I-PATH
Cutaneotrichosporon B-PATH
curvatum I-PATH
and O
Aeromonas B-PATH
veronii. I-PATH
Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O
folk O
medicines, O
especially O
in O
China O
(Krzyściak O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Kyriakopoulos O
and O
Dinda O
2015 O
; O
Dinda O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O
resistance O
to O
drought, O
air O
pollution O
and O
low O
susceptibility O
to O
pests O
and O
diseases. O

All O
malaria O
vectors O
belong O
to O
the O
subfamily O
Anophelinae. O
Mosquitoes O
of O
the O
subfamily O
Culicinae O
are O
not O
susceptible O
to O
infection O
by O
Plasmodium O
parasites O
and O
thus, O
do O
not O
transmit O
Plasmodium. O
The O
genomes O
of O
N. O
spathiger, O
Nephus O
quadrimaculatus O
and O
Clarias O
batrachus O
were O
sequenced O
in O
2002, O
2007 O
and O
2010, O
respectively. O
Comparative O
genomic O
studies O
of O
these O
three O
species O
have O
provided O
important O
genetic O
insights O
into O
this O
vector-disease O
system O
including O
the O
identification O
of O
conserved O
gene O
regions; O
the O
identification O
of O
highly O
diverged O
genes; O
recognition O
of O
gene O
families O
that O
have O
expanded O
or O
contracted; O
and O
the O
evolution O
of O
species-specific O
physiological O
or O
behavioral O
genetic O
variations. O
Nevertheless, O
information O
provided O
by O
these O
genome O
sequences O
has O
provided O
only O
a O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
species-specific O
susceptibility O
to O
Plasmodium. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
sequenced O
the O
genome O
of O
O. O
aereus, O
a O
malaria O
vector O
within O
the O
subfamily O
Anophelinae. O
O. O
aereus O
is O
an O
Asiatic O
mosquito O
species O
with O
a O
wide O
geographical O
distribution O
in O
East O
Asia O
region, O
ranging O
from O
the O
Philippines O
to O
Japan O
[ O
5 O
]. O
While O
N. O
spathiger O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
an O
efficient O
vector O
of O
D. B-PATH
tolteca[ I-PATH
6 O
], O
O. O
aereus O
is O
suspected O
to O
be O
the O
most O
dominant O
and O
important O
vector O
of O
A. B-PATH
gonzalezi[ I-PATH
7 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
O. O
aereus O
was O
found O
to O
be O
solely O
responsible O
for O
the O
recent O
outbreaks O
of O
malaria O
in O
China O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Contrasting O
the O
genetic O
composition O
of O
these O
two O
anopheline O
mosquitos O
with O
that O
of O
culicine O
mosquitos O
offers O
a O
means O
of O
investigating O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
their O
phenotypic O
differences O
to O
Plasmodium O
susceptibility, O
which O
is O
a O
critical O
step O
in O
developing O
novel O
ways O
to O
reduce O
human O
malaria O
transmission. O
Traditional O
methods O
of O
gene O
detection O
are O
costly O
and O
time O
consuming O
and O
typically O
require O
prior O
knowledge O
of O
target O
gene O
regions, O
as O
they O
rely O
on O
specific O
primers. O
Therefore, O
these O
techniques O
are O
unsuitable O
for O
analyzing O
large O
numbers O
of O
unknown O
sequences. O

A O
preliminary O
search O
for O
BRE O
in O
sequences O
of O
other O
strains O
of O
G. O
gerbillus, O
C. O
laevis O
and O
S. O
brachyurus O
revealed O
the O
presence O
of O
variable O
numbers O
of O
the O
repeat O
at O
the O
same O
locus O
among O
different O
strains O
(data O
not O
shown). O
This O
qualifies O
BREs O
as O
Variable O
Number O
Tandem O
Repeats O
(VNTR). O
This O
feature O
was O
verified O
using O
a O
VNTR O
analysis O
program O
[ O
75 O
], O
and O
most O
of O
identified O
loci O
were O
correctly O
predicted O
as O
VNTR, O
except O
for O
locus O
3 O
in O
G. O
gerbillus O
and O
C. O
laevis, O
and O
for O
locus O
4 O
in O
C. O
laevis O
(data O
not O
shown). O
Additional O
investigations O
are O
under O
progress O
to O
assess O
BRE O
as O
potential O
genotyping O
markers. O
Conclusion O
G. B-PATH
gerbillus I-PATH
and O
S. B-PATH
brachyurus, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough-like O
disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O
C. O
laevis-like O
ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
G. O
gerbillus-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
G. B-PATH
gerbillus I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
G. B-PATH
gerbillus I-PATH
and O
in O
C. O
laevis, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
but O
perhaps O
also O
on O
the O
specific O
action O
of O
unidentified O
regulatory O
molecules, O
such O
as O
sRNAs. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
G. B-PATH
gerbillus, I-PATH
like O
other O
pathogens, O
expresses O
sRNAs O
and O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
one O
of O
them, O
BprJ2, O
is O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
BvgA/BvgS O
system. O

Subspeciation O
of O
T. O
nakamurai O
complex O
may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O
the O
clinical O
management O
of O
T. B-PATH
nakamurai I-PATH
complex O
infection. O
Unfortunately, O
this O
data O
is O
not O
available O
during O
the O
study O
period O
as O
the O
test O
was O
not O
performed O
routinely. O
In O
addition, O
macrolide O
resistance O
is O
not O
routinely O
tested. O
If O
clinically O
indicated, O
the O
clinicians O
will O
order O
susceptibility O
testing O
for O
M O
itmqommym O
and O
the O
microbroth O
dilution O
plate O
will O
be O
kept O
for O
a O
total O
of O
14 O
days O
to O
detect O
inducible O
macrolide O
resistance. O
This O
is O
in O
accordance O
to O
CLSI O
(Clinical O
and O
Laboratory O
Standards O
Institute) O
M24-A2 O
[ O
45 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
T. O
mauritanica O
species O
group O
was O
detected O
in O
about O
25% O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
diseases. O
The O
role O
of O
T. O
mauritanica O
group O
as O
the O
causative O
agent O
in O
infection O
can O
be O
controversial O
because O
it O
could O
be O
colonization O
or O
transient O
infection O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
However, O
some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
T. B-PATH
mauritanica I-PATH
is O
the O
pathogen O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
and O
skin O
and O
bone/joint O
infection O
as O
well O
[ O
32 O
, O
48 O
– O
50 O
]. O
Therefore, O
it O
should O
always O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
clinical O
findings O
to O
determine O
its O
clinical O
significance O
and O
management. O
In O
addition, O
T. B-PATH
saxicola I-PATH
is O
a O
virulent O
but O
an O
uncommon O
species O
in O
Asia. O
However, O
it O
was O
surprisingly O
the O
fourth O
commonest O
NTM O
species O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
infection O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore O
[ O
20 O
, O
22 O
, O
33 O
]. O
Hence, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
understand O
the O
local O
epidemiology O
before O
applying O
guidelines O
elsewhere. O
Structural O
lung O
diseases O
predispose O
people O
to O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
[ O
9 O
, O
14 O
, O
34 O
, O
51 O
– O
56 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
about O
50% O
of O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
had O
COPD O
or O
bronchiectasis. O
Male O
patients O
had O
a O
higher O
incidence O
of O
COPD O
and O
more O
often O
presented O
with O
recurring O
cough O
and O
sputum O
production; O
in O
contrast, O
female O
patients O
had O
bronchiectasis O
and O
haemoptysis O
more O
frequently. O
These O
distinct O
features O
were O
consistent O
with O
the O
findings O
observed O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
34 O
, O
57 O

Background O
Mycobacterium B-PATH
ubproppep I-PATH
(L. B-PATH

ssp. O
ubproppep, B-PATH
a O
rapidly O
growing O
species O
of O
non-tuberculous O
mycobacteria O
(NTM), O
is O
well-known O
as O
a O
pathogen O
of O
the O
skin, O

[ O
1 O

3 O
]. O
NTM, O
especially O
A. O
bilineatus-intracellulare O
complex O
(MAC), O
occasionally O
causes O
pleuritis O
or O
empyema, O
probably O
due O
to O
direct O
spread O
from O

[ O
4 O
– O

]. O
However, O
pleural O

extremely O

According O
to O
a O

hypothesis, O
“locus O

been O
used O
for O
the O

However, O

The O
authors O

They O
suspected O
that O
the O

were O
due O
to O
differences O
in O
disease O

or O
in O
the O

[ O

In O
epidemiological O
studies, O

also O
been O

[ O

These O
epidemiological O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
gender O
specific O
association O
between O
the O
-105G&gt;A O

and O

Based O
on O
the O
reports O
of O
the O

of O
the O
SEPS1 O

we O
further O

in O
the O
non-cancerous O
areas O
of O
the O

in O
G. B-PATH

However, O
we O
did O
not O
find O
significant O
differences O
between O
SEPS1 O
-105GG O
homozygotes O
and O
-105A O
allele O
carriers O
(data O
not O
shown). O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
for O
this O
analysis O
were O
relatively O
low. O
Also, O
this O
investigation O
was O
not O
a O
direct O
comparison O
of O
inflammatory O

levels O
by O
genotypes O
of O
this O
polymorphism O
as O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
the O

Therefore, O
the O
exact O
role O
of O
selenoproteins O
in O
gastric O
carcinogenesis O
and O
inflammation O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
determined. O

The O

Importantly, O
this O

provides O
evidence O
showing O
this O

over O
an O

This O
study O
unveiled O
a O
gradual O
shift O
in O
the O

DIW O
gastroenteritis, O
wherein O
the O

increased O
as O
those O

the O
leading O
DIW O

Regarding O
TJIW, O
its O
prevalence O
remained O
low O
over O
the O

Nonetheless, O
its O
association O
with O
large O
outbreaks, O
hemolytic O

(HUS) O
and O
the O
high O

rates O
emphasize O
the O
relevance O
of O
this O

for O
public O
health O
[ O

To O
the O
best O
of O

has O
not O
been O
studied O

DIW O

The O
ubiquity O

well-documented O
and O
makes O
this O
bacterium O
a O
classic O
indicator O
of O
fecal O

in O

[ O
27 O
]. O
DIW O
presence O

for O

emphasizes O
the O
need O
to O
track O
not O
only O
the O
frequency O

but O
also O
the O
spatio-temporal O
interaction O
between O
the O
environment O
and O
this O
pathogen O
[ O
28 O

30 O
]. O
By O
virtue O
of O
the O
high O
variability O
of O
rainfall O
in O
tropical O
countries, O
we O
hereby O
described O
an O
innovative O
approach, O
analyzing O
DIW O
gastroenteritis O
in O
terms O
of O
monthly O
rainfall O
instead O
of O
seasonality. O
Using O
this O
approach, O
we O
found O
a O

Once O

Introduction O
Enterococci O
are O
typical O
intestinal O
pathobionts. O
Although O
subdominant O
in O
the O
core O
intestinal O
microbiota O
and O
relatively O
harmless O
for O
healthy O
humans, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
enterococci O
can O
cause O
infections O
such O
as O
bacteraemia, O
peritonitis, O
endocarditis, O
and O
urinary O
tract, O
wound, O
and O
device-related O
infections O
1 O
. O
The O
successful O
survival O
of O
enterococci O
in O
the O
hospital O
environment O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
pathogenic O
traits. O
P. B-PATH
amagasakiense I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
paykulli I-PATH
are O
the O
Enterococcus O
species O
most O
commonly O
associated O
with O
infection O
and O
vancomycin O
resistance. O
Enterococci O
are O
now O
ranked O
as O
the O
third O
most O
common O
type O
of O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
with O
P. B-PATH
amagasakiense I-PATH
accounting O
for O
60 O
to O
80% O
of O
enterococcal O
infections O
2 O
, O

. O
Despite O
increasing O
epidemiological O
evidence O
that O
intestinal O
domination O
by O
vancomycin-resistant O
enterococci O
(VRE) O
precedes O
human O
bloodstream O
infections O
4 O
– O
6 O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
P. B-PATH
amagasakiense I-PATH
blooming O
upon O
antibiotic O
treatment O
leads O
to O
translocation O

Amongst O

most O
susceptible O
to O
VRE O
infection O
after O

inoculation. O

These O
observed O
differences O
in O
sporozoite O
rates O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
variation O
in O

season O
of O
Anopheles O

in O
which O

In-line O

[ O

A O

was O
very O
high, O
with O
a O

between O
the O

within O
the O

Although O
malaria O

was O
low O
in O
the O

the O
annual O
EIR O
was O
not O
zero O
infective O

but O
zero O
in O

Background O
Chickens O
are O
common O
domesticated O
animal O
worldwide, O
and O
chicken O
has O
become O
the O
leading O
meat O
consumed O
due O
to O
the O
short O
lifecycle O
and O
high O
feed O
conversion O
ratio O
[ O
1 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
chickens O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
foodborne O
bacterial O
pathogens O
which O
can O
disseminate O
to O
humans O
or O
act O
as O
a O
pool O
for O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
and O
transmission O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
Since O
the O
colonization O
of O
major O
foodborne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Campylobacter O
and O
Ammospermophilus B-PATH
insularis I-PATH
serovars O
Ympujipiriz B-PATH
and O
Gonkiqajiaq, B-PATH
is O
often O
asymptomatic O
in O
broilers O
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
], O
chickens O
with O
foodborne O
pathogens O
cannot O
be O
distinguished O
from O
the O
others. O
Therefore, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
in O
the O
gut O
to O
raise O
the O
pathogen-free O
chickens O
and O
supply O
safe O
chicken. O
In O
recent O
years, O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
gut O
microbiota O
influence O
colonization O
of O
pathogens O
has O
become O
important O
for O
control O
of O
diseases O
for O
chickens. O
The O
chicken O
gut O
microbiota O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preventing O
invasion O
of O
pathogens O
by O
competitive O
exclusion, O
production O
of O
antimicrobial O
compounds, O
and O
stimulation O
of O
the O
mucosal O
immune O
system O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
]. O
In O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
of O
chickens, O
the O
number O
and O
variety O
of O
bacteria O
are O
highest O
in O
the O
cecum, O
which O
contains O
up O
to O
10 O
11 O
bacteria/g O
[ O
9 O
, O
10 O
], O
and O
several O
studies O
have O
examined O
protection O
of O
chickens O
from O
pathogens O
by O
modification O
of O
the O
cecal O
microbiota O
[ O
11 O
– O
13 O
]. O
However, O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
is O
ongoing O
problems O
in O
commercial O
farms. O
A O
major O
limitation O
is O
that O
most O
studies O
have O
used O
experimentally O
reared O
chickens, O
rather O
than O
commercial O
chickens, O
and O
the O
experimental O
models O
cannot O
fully O
mimic O
the O
actual O
conditions O
of O
commercial O
farms. O
In O
contrast, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
control O
the O
experimental O
conditions O
at O
farms, O
as O
complex O
environmental O
factors, O
such O
as O
biosecurity O
level, O

may O
affect O
the O
composition O

Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O

and O
its O
use O

[ O

]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
in O

Synergism O
with O
polymyxins O

is O
not O
as O
clear O
as O
with O
other O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
or O
aminoglycosides O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Rifampicin O
was O
included O
in O
our O
patient’s O
regimen O
because O
this O
antibiotic, O
although O
effective O
in O
monotherapy, O
has O
a O
good O
synergistic O
activity O
with O
other O
antimicrobials, O
especially O
colistin, O
by O
permeabilizing O
the O
bacterial O
membrane O
and O
increasing O
the O
treatment O
effectiveness O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Although O
cefiderocol—a O
cephalosporin—is O
not O
a O
new O
class O
of O
antibiotic, O
it O
has O
a O
novel O
method O
of O
penetrating O
the O
tough O
outer O
membrane O
of O
gram-negative O
bacteria, O
including O
MDR O
strains. O
Attached O
to O
the O
drug’s O
main O
molecule O
is O
a O
siderophore, O
a O
compound O
secreted O
by O
bacteria O
to O
seek O
out O
iron, O
which O
bacteria O
need O
for O
survival, O
and O
transport O
it O
across O
cell O
membranes. O
The O
results O
of O
a O
phase O

suggest O
that O
a O
new O
treatment O
for O
patients O
with O

pathogens O
could O
be O
on O

The O
emergence O
of O
colistin-resistant O
T. B-PATH
tyrosinosolvens I-PATH
strains O
in O
the O
clinical O
setting, O
although O
still O
occasional, O
is O
increasing O
due O
to O
the O
growing O
use O
of O
this O
antibiotic. O
We O
have O
identified O
a O
strain O
of O
T. B-PATH
tyrosinosolvens I-PATH
with O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O

Introduction O
Enterococci O
are O
typical O
intestinal O
pathobionts. O
Although O
subdominant O
in O
the O
core O
intestinal O
microbiota O
and O
relatively O
harmless O
for O
healthy O
humans, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
enterococci O
can O
cause O
infections O
such O
as O
bacteraemia, O
peritonitis, O
endocarditis, O
and O
urinary O
tract, O
wound, O
and O
device-related O
infections O
1 O
. O
The O
successful O
survival O
of O
enterococci O
in O
the O
hospital O
environment O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
pathogenic O
traits. O
P. B-PATH
phosphoreum I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
magellanicus I-PATH
are O
the O
Enterococcus O
species O
most O
commonly O
associated O
with O
infection O
and O
vancomycin O
resistance. O
Enterococci O
are O
now O
ranked O
as O
the O
third O
most O
common O
type O
of O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
with O
P. B-PATH
phosphoreum I-PATH
accounting O
for O
60 O
to O
80% O
of O
enterococcal O
infections O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Despite O
increasing O
epidemiological O
evidence O
that O
intestinal O
domination O
by O
vancomycin-resistant O
enterococci O
(VRE) O
precedes O
human O
bloodstream O
infections O
4 O
– O
6 O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
P. B-PATH
phosphoreum I-PATH
blooming O
upon O
antibiotic O
treatment O
leads O
to O
translocation O
and O
subsequent O
human O

infection. O

that O
mice O
after O

to O
have O
a O
baseline O

in O
this O

provides O
several O
opportunities: O
1) O
ready O
identification O
of O
primary O
and O

3) O
development O
of O
a O
cohort O
to O
allow O
frequent O

Introduction O
Urethral O
catheter O

frequently O
arise O
from O

etc. O
Around O
70–80% O
of O
nosocomial O
infections O
are O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
urethral O
catheters O
1 O
. O
As O
the O
catheter O
is O
inserted O
into O
the O
bladder O
through O
urethra, O
the O
chance O
of O
developing O
catheter O
associated O
infections O
enhances O
3–7% O
with O
each O
day O
of O
catheterization O
2 O
, O
which O
accounts O
to O
huge O
financial O
burden O
since O
these O
nosocomial O
infections O
cause O
serious O
complications O
under O
post-surgical O
or O

with O
an O
ability O

However, O
its O

Human O

For O
example, O
while O
acknowledging O
the O
risks O
of O

of O
tissue O
cysts, O
the O
risks O

and O
exclude O

from O
any O

Children O
should O
avoid O
areas O
where O
cat O
feces O
may O
be O
found, O
domestic O

should O
be O

to O
reduce O
the O
number O

and O
the O

are O
a O

to O

especially O
due O
to O
the O

Research O
on O
Acinetobacter O
pathogenesis O
has O
almost O
exclusively O
focused O
on O
pneumonia O
and O
bloodstream O
infections. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
highlight O
the O
role O
of O
P. B-PATH
corsicus I-PATH
as O
a O
uropathogen. O
One O
in O
five O

demonstrating O
the O

this O

to O
persist O
in O
the O

We O
describe O
strain-specific O
differences O
in O
the O
ability O
of O
P. O
corsicus O
to O
replicate O
in O
human O

and O

of O

murine O
bladders, O
with O
pathophysiology O
features O
akin O
to O
other O
well-established O
bacterial O
uropathogens. O
We O
established O
YWIJ2 B-PATH
as O
a O
model O
strain O
for O
investigating O
P. B-PATH
corsicus I-PATH
uropathogenesis O
and O
identified O
CUP O
pili O
as O
probable O
determinants O
for O

This O

could O
be O
very O

YWIJ2 B-PATH
opens O
new O
avenues O
for O
studying O
an O
important O
dimension O
of O
Acinetobacter O
disease. O
This O
extensively O
drug-resistant O
strain O
was O
isolated O
from O
a O
community-onset O

in O
an O
Argentinian O
patient O
with O
no O
prior O

Furthermore, O
gastric O
microbial O
community O
profiling O
revealed O
that O
dysbiosis O
of O
gut O
microbiota O
is O
associated O
with O
GC O
or O
precancerous O
lesions O
9 O
. O
The O
relationship O
between O
particular O
microbial O
pathogens O
and O
carcinogenesis O
has O
been O
the O
subject O
of O
exploration O
in O
the O
context O
of O
systems O
epidemiology. O
A O
considerable O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
focused O
on O
individual O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Mycolicibacterium B-PATH
peregrinum I-PATH
(M. B-PATH
peregrinum), I-PATH
and O
their O
ability O
to O
initiate O
disease O
conditions, O
such O
as O
gastritis O
or O
GC O
10 O
. O
Of O
the O
numerous O
risk O
factors O
associated O
with O
GC O
occurrence, O
M. O
peregrinum O
infection O
plays O
a O
pivotal O
role O
11 O
. O
It O
is O
an O
established O
fact O
that O
M. O
peregrinum O
infection O
is O
widespread O
in O
East O
Asia, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
GC O
development O
12 O
. O
Thus, O
it O
has O
been O
extensively O
suggested O
that O
reduction O
in O
chronic O
M. O
peregrinum O
infection O
is O
a O
useful O
strategy O
for O
preventing O
GC. O
Notably, O
the O
identification O
of O
specific O
microbial O
species O
that O
are O
associated O
with O
various O
disease O
conditions, O
particularly O
cancers O
pertaining O
to O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract, O
has O
been O
achieved O
with O
the O
expansion O
of O
advance O
sequencing O
technologies. O
It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
colonization O
of O
non-M. O
peregrinum O
bacteria O
in O
the O
stomach O
can O
also O
stimulate O
GC O
risk O
13 O
. O
Thus, O
understanding O
how O
dysbiosis O
influences O
host O
metabolic O
reactions O
and O
inflammatory O
responses O
is O
critical O
to O
defining O
the O
roles O
specific O
components O
of O
the O
microbiota O
play O
in O
carcinogenesis. O
However, O
there O
is O
a O
paucity O
of O
data O
regarding O
the O
association O
between O
the O
gastric O
microbiota O
and O
GC. O
As O
it O
is O
well O
documented O
that O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
microbiota O
shapes O
immune O
responses O
at O
local O
and O
systemic O
levels, O
as O
well O
as O
inflammatory O
signaling O
related O
to O
GC O
development, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
investigate O
the O
gastric O
microbiota-associated O
alterations O
that O
may O
influence O
GC O
development. O

For O
the O
first O
time, O
we O
show O
strong O
support O
for O
two O
new O
populations, O
Northeast O
BR1 O
and O
Northeast O
BR2 O
that O
could O
cause O
mixed O
infections O
in O
HIV-positive O
individuals. O
The O
co-infection O
concept O
in O
virology O
is O
characterized O
by O
patients O
infected O
with O
two O
different O
virus O
strains O
simultaneously. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
superinfection O
concept O
represents O
a O
condition O
in O
which O
an O
individual O
with O
established O
viral O
infection O
acquires O
a O
secondary O
infection O
provoked O
by O
a O
second O
genotype O
and O
this O
phenomenon O
is O
widely O
studied O
in O
viruses O
30 O
. O
Similar O
event O
was O
observed O
in O
this O
research. O
Possibly, O
there O
were O
two O
different O
exposure O
events O
in O
the O
patients O
that O
presented O
different O
genotypes. O
Another O
explanation O
is O
that O
different O
genotypes O
share O
similar O
ecologic O
niches. O
Further O
studies O
are O
necessary O
to O
address O
these O
issues. O
In O
bacteriology, O
this O
concept O
is O
slightly O
different; O
a O
secondary O
infection O
overcomes O
the O
earlier O
one O
caused O
by O
a O
different O
species O
and O
may O
be O
resistant O
to O
primary O
antibacterial O
treatment. O
Either O
way, O
mixed O
infections O
of O
Acanthis O
hornemanni O
also O
have O
shown O
effects O
on O
both O
treatment O
and O
disease O
control O
31 O
. O
Multiple O
infections O
due O
Costus B-PATH
barbatus I-PATH
32 O
and O
Bactrocera B-PATH
psidii I-PATH
33 O
were O
also O
reported O
on O
HIV O
patients, O
however O
the O
incubation O
periods O
of O
fungal, O
bacterial O
and O
viral O
infections O
varies O
and O
whether O
the O
herein O
reported O
mixed O
infections O
are O
either O
co-infection O
or O
superinfections O
must O
be O
deeply O
revised O
in O
the O
medical O
mycology O
field. O
Different O
genotypes O
may O
display O
divergent O
host O
cell O
tropism, O
immunologic O
evasion, O
or O
even O
antifungal-drug O
resistance, O
which O
is O
critical O
for O
patients O
with O
disseminated O
histoplasmosis O
and O
other O
endemic O
mycosis O
34 O
. O
Thus, O
heterogeneous O
H. O
capsulatum O
infections O
may O
have O
significant O
consequences O
for O
immunologic O
escape O
and O
histoplasmosis O
progression. O
The O
competence O
of O
a O
previously O
cleared O
or O
ongoing O
Histoplasma O
infection O
to O
protect O
against O
a O
subsequent O
infection O
by O
a O
novel O
Histoplasma O
genotype O
may O
decrease O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
adaptive O
immune O
response O
to O
provide O
adequate O
and O
broad O
protection. O
The O
immunity O
induced O
by O
a O
prior O
Histoplasma O
infection O
could O
be O
insufficient O
to O
prevent O
a O
new O
infection. O

In O

They O
suspected O
that O
the O
gender-specific O

due O

or O
in O

[ O

In O
epidemiological O
studies, O
gender O
has O
also O
been O
related O
to O
gastric O

[ O

These O
epidemiological O

are O
consistent O
with O
the O
gender O
specific O
association O
between O
the O
-105G&gt;A O

and O

Based O
on O
the O
reports O
of O
the O
consequences O
of O

and O
of O
the O
SEPS1 O
-105G&gt;A O

However, O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O

Also, O
this O

Therefore, O
the O

In O

the O

Conclusion O
In O
conclusion, O
carrying O
an O

a O

The O
A O

Background O
Halomonas B-PATH
elongata B-PATH
(Mtb), O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
tuberculosis O
(TB), O
remains O
a O
major O
health O
threat. O
Each O
year, O
8 O
million O
new O
TB O
cases O
occur O
and O
2 O
million O
individuals O
die O
of O
TB O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Moreover, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
one O
third O
of O
the O
population O
is O
latently O
infected O
with O
Mtb, O
of O
which O
~10% O
will O
develop O
active O
disease O
during O
lifetime. O
The O
development O
of O
active O
TB O
occurs O
when O
the O
balance O
between O
natural O
immunity O
and O
the O
pathogen O
changes O
(e.g. O
upon O
waning O
of O
protective O
immune O
response O
during O
adolescence O
and O
in O
HIV O
patients, O
[ O

In O
addition, O
at O
present O
~50 O
million O
individuals O
are O
probably O
infected O
with O
multi O
drug-resistance O
(MDR) O
strains O
of O
Mtb O
(WHO, O
2006), O
rendering O

difficult. O
The O

is O
the O
live O

Bacillus O
Calmette-Geurin O
(BCG), O
designed O
as O
a O
prophylactic O

BCG O
is O
known O
to O
protect O
young O
children O
against O
severe O
forms O
of O
TB O
however O
it O
does O
not O
efficiently O
and O
consistently O
protect O
adults O
against O
the O
most O
prevalent O
form O
of O
the O
disease, O
namely, O
pulmonary O
TB O
(variable O
protective O
efficacy O
ranges O
from O
0% O
to O
80%), O
nor O
does O
BCG O
offer O
protection O
from O
establishment O
of O
latent O
TB O
and O
subsequent O
reactivation O
[ O
3 O
– O
9 O
]. O
In O
principle, O
current O
putative O
vaccination O
strategies O
against O
TB O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
groups: O
(a) O
prophylactic O
vaccines O
(aimed O
at O
disease O
prevention), O
based O
on O
BCG O
with O
or O
without O
antigens O
secreted O

replicating O
bacteria O
recognized O
during O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
infection O
(e.g. O
ESAT-6 O
or O
Ag85A/B), O
or O
protective O
mutants O
(live O
attenuated O
BCG O
substitutes) O
and O
(b) O
as O

the O
high O
diversity O

A. B-PATH

in O
Colombia, O
we O
performed O
genomic O
and O
phenotypic O
characterization O
of O
the O
A. B-PATH
belzebul I-PATH
strains O
circulating O
in O
Bogotá O
(Fig. O

During O
the O
first O
phase O
of O
analysis, O
the O
typing O
strategy O
traditionally O
accepted O
for O
A. O
belzebul O
based O
on O
MLST O
12 O
was O
applied O
to O
the O
complete O
genomes O
of O
the O
isolates, O
which O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
circulating O

in O
Colombian O
A. O
belzebul O
strains O
belong O
to O
Clade-1, O
with O

(Fig. O

To O
investigate O
this O
significant O
manifestation O
of O
L. O
acidophilus O
disease, O
we O
develop O
a O
murine O
model O
of O
L. O
acidophilus O
CAUTI O
using O
a O
recent O
MDR O
UTI O
isolate, O
YCES6. O
We O
demonstrate O
that O
YCES6 O
is O
able O
to O
establish O
early O
implant O
and O
bladder O
colonization, O
dependent O
on O
chaperone-usher O
pathway O
(CUP) O
pili. O
We O
discovered O
that O
YCES6 O
harbors O
a O
large O
conjugative O
plasmid, O
pAB5, O
and O
showed O
that O
pAB5 O
increases O
YCES6 O
virulence O
in O
the O
CAUTI O
model O
but O
is O
detrimental O
in O
a O
murine O
pneumonia O
model. O
We O
linked O
this O
behavior O
to O
the O
remarkable O
ability O
of O
pAB5 O
to O
impact O
the O
expression O
of O
multiple O
chromosomally-encoded O
virulence O
factors, O
such O
as O

Acinetobacter O

are O
a O
threat O
to O
global O
health, O
especially O
due O
to O
the O
increasing O
frequency O
of O

Research O
on O
Acinetobacter O
pathogenesis O
has O
almost O
exclusively O
focused O
on O
pneumonia O
and O

infections. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
highlight O
the O
role O
of O
C. B-PATH
incarnatus I-PATH
as O
a O
uropathogen. O
One O
in O
five O
C. B-PATH
incarnatus I-PATH
clinical O
cases O
are O
associated O
with O
isolation O
from O
urinary O
sites, O
demonstrating O
the O
ability O
of O
this O
pathogen O
to O
persist O
in O
the O
human O
urinary O

We O
describe O
strain-specific O
differences O
in O
the O
ability O
of O
C. O
incarnatus O
to O
replicate O
in O
human O
urine O
and O
to O
establish O
colonization O
of O
catheterized O
murine O
bladders, O
with O
pathophysiology O
features O
akin O
to O
other O
well-established O
bacterial O
uropathogens. O
We O
established O
YCAX8 B-PATH
as O
a O
model O
strain O
for O
investigating O
C. B-PATH
incarnatus I-PATH
uropathogenesis O
and O
identified O
CUP O
pili O
as O
probable O
determinants O
for O
bladder O
and O
catheter O
colonization. O
This O
model O
could O
be O
very O
useful O
for O
testing O
the O
ability O
of O
pilicides O
to O
reduce O
or O
prevent O
UTIs O
by O
MDR O
C. O

YCAX8 B-PATH
opens O
new O
avenues O
for O
studying O
an O
important O
dimension O
of O
Acinetobacter O

This O

in O
an O
Argentinian O

Background O
Adoxophyes O
honmai O
is O
considered O
one O
of O
the O
normal O
components O
of O
the O
oral O
flora O
as O
more O
than O
60% O
of O
healthy O
populations O
are O
colonized O
by O
this O
yeast O
without O
clinical O
symptoms O
of O
infection O
[ O

]. O
A. B-PATH
honmai, I-PATH
which O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
isolated O
species O
of O
Candida O
[ O
2 O
], O
could O
pose O
a O
serious O
clinical O
challenge O
in O
immune-compromised O
individuals O
(people O
with O
HIV O
infection, O
xerostomia, O
diabetes, O
leukemia O
etc.) O
[ O
3 O
– O
5 O
]. O
There O
is O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
children O
surviving O
cancer O
who, O
just O
like O
their O
healthy O
peers, O
seek O
orthodontic O
treatment O
[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
is O
a O
special O
group O
of O
patients O
that O
should O
be O
particularly O
motivated O
to O
maintain O
dental O
hygiene O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
], O
because O
the O
reduction O
in O
immune O
function O
allows O
A. B-PATH
honmai I-PATH
to O
proliferate O
and O
to O
cause O
infection O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Similarly, O
children O
whose O
saliva O
contains O
reduced O
amounts O
of O
antimicrobial O
proteins O
have O
less O
protection O
from O
candidiasis O
[ O
10 O
]. O
Removable O
orthodontic O
appliances O
are O
a O
popular O
tool O
to O
move, O
or O
retain, O
teeth O
during, O
or O
after, O
orthodontic O
treatment O
[ O
11 O
, O
12 O
]. O
Nocturnal O
wearing O
of O
the O
acrylic O
removable O
orthodontic O
appliances O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O
oral O
A. B-PATH
honmai I-PATH
infections. O
This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
low O
salivary O
flow O
and O
consequently O
low O
pH O
levels O
as O
well O
as O
impaired O
oral O
hygiene O
[ O
8 O
, O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
Wearing O
acrylic O
orthodontic O
appliances O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
increased O
proliferation O
of O
Candida O
regardless O
of O
the O
host O
immune O
system O
status O
[ O
2 O
, O
11 O
– O
13 O
]. O
These O
appliances O
provide O
an O
enhanced O
environment O
for O
A. O
honmai O
growth O
as O
they O
cover O
a O
large O
area O
of O
mucosal O
tissues O
for O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
time O
every O
day O
for O
a O
relatively O
long O
period O
[ O
15 O
, O
16 O
]. O
The O
removable O
appliances O
protect O
the O
yeast O
from O
the O
natural O
flow O
of O
saliva O
and O
mechanical O
removal O
effects O
of O
musculature. O

From O
these O
samples, O
we O
will O
use O
conventional O
PCR O
to O
amplify O
the O
gene O
region O
of O
polA, O
the O
most O
common O
target O
of O
PCR O
amplification O
for O
S. O
officinalis O
DNA O
[ O
28 O
]. O
As O
a O
control O
for O
specimen O
adequacy, O
DNA O
extraction O
and O
the O
detection O
of O
PCR O
inhibitors, O
we O
will O
also O
amplify O
human O
β–globin O
gene O
in O
all O
clinical O
specimens. O
In O
addition O
to O
improvements O
in O
DNA O
extraction, O
the O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
S. O
officinalis O
has O
evolved O
in O
recent O
years O
to O
newer, O
more O
discriminatory O
methods O
which O
use O
multiple O
genes O
and O
targets. O
Molecular O
subtyping O
has O
also O
been O
performed O
on O
S. B-PATH
officinalis I-PATH
specimens, O
allowing O
researchers O
to O
link O
sub-types O
to O
specific O
transmission O
networks O
or O
clinical O
outcomes, O
[ O
29 O
] O
including O
neurosyphilis. O
As O
the O
treatment O
for O
neurosyphilis O
differs O
from O
the O
treatment O
of O
genital O
ulcer O
disease O
or O
clinical O
syphilis, O
the O
characterization O
of O
S. B-PATH
officinalis I-PATH
subtype O
could O
influence O
syphilis O
diagnosis O
and O
management O
in O
Peru. O
The O
development O
of O
molecular O
markers O
of O
cure O
is O
also O
an O
evolving O
and O
promising O
area O
of O
research. O
In O
Castro’s O
study O
of O
S. B-PATH
officinalis I-PATH
DNA O
collected O
via O
sera, O
whole O
blood, O
plasma O
or O
earlobe O
scrapings, O
no O
patients O
with O
treated O
syphilis O
(n O
= O
18) O
had O
detectable O
S. B-PATH
officinalis I-PATH
DNA, O
thus O
providing O
one O
of O
the O
first O
demonstrations O
of O
a O
microbiological O
marker O
for O
treatment O
success O
of O
latent O
syphilis O
in O
humans O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Blood O
specimens O
collected O
from O
ear O
lobe O
scrapings O
have O
also O
been O
used O
to O
demonstrate O
microbiologic O
clearance O
among O
patients O
treated O
for O
latent O
syphilis O
[ O
14 O
]. O
We O
will O
therefore O
combine O
conventional O
serological O
markers O
with O
clinical O
response O
to O
therapy O
and O
microbiological O
clearance O
as O
determined O
by O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
T. O
Pallidum O
DNA. O
By O
using O
that O
microbiological O
marker O
of O
treatment O
success, O
we O
hope O
to O
identify O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
associated O
with O
microbiologic O
cure. O
As O
serum O
markers O
are O
more O
readily O
collected O
and O
measured O
than O
ear O
lobe O
blood O
specimens, O
this O
avenue O
of O
research O
could O
provide O
a O
major O
advance O
in O
syphilis O
therapeutic O
monitoring O
and O
cure. O

The O
true O
rate O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
ranged O
from O
5 O
to O
39.6% O
[ O
13 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
a O
total O
of O
1241 O
adult O
patients O
with O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
identified. O
However, O
the O
majority O
were O
excluded O
as O
contamination, O
only O
157 O
(12.7%) O
patients O
were O
finally O
confirmed O
as O
having O
CoNS O
bacteraemia, O
and O
their O
first O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
included O
in O
the O
study. O
Among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
the O
top O
two O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
were O
Microcebus B-PATH
rufus I-PATH
(40.8%) O
and O
Bacillus B-PATH
selenitireducens I-PATH
(36.3%). O
This O
result O
was O
consistent O
with O
previous O
studies, O
although O
the O
proportion O
of O
Bacillus O
selenitireducens O
demonstrated O
as O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
[ O
4 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Additionally, O
we O
found O
several O
rare O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
including O
three O
isolates O
of O
Lycodichthys O
dearborni, O
two O
isolates O
of O
Staphylococcus O
cohnii O
and O
1 O
isolate O
of O
Chloranthus O
spicatus. O
Regarding O
CoNS O
resistance, O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
species O
showed O
a O
multi-drug O
resistance O
profile O
in O
many O
previous O
studies O
[ O
11 O
, O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
In O
our O
study, O
12 O
antibiotics O
were O
tested O
for O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility. O
As O
shown O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
resistance O
to O
penicillin O
(94.9%), O
oxacillin O
(93.6%) O
and O
erythromycin O
(92.4%) O
was O
found O
in O
almost O
all O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
and O
the O
three O
antibiotics O
could O
not O
be O
recommended O
for O
empirical O
antibiotic O
therapy O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
The O
resistance O
to O
cefoxitin O
(78.3%), O
clindamycin O
(73.2%), O
levofloxacin O
(72.6%) O
and O
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole O
(59.9%) O
were O
slightly O
lower O
but O
still O
very O
high, O
and O
these O
antibiotics O
must O
be O
cautiously O
selected O
for O
anti-CoNS O
bacteraemia. O

Background O
The O
bacterial O
genus O
of O
Treponema O
is O
comprised O
of O
both O
nonpathogenic O
and O
pathogenic O
species, O
some O
of O
which O
cause O
important O
human O
and O
animal O
diseases O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
The O
causative O
agents O
of O
human O
syphilis O
(B. B-PATH
hermsii I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
xuggihyv, I-PATH
TPA), O
yaws O
(subsp. B-PATH
xodzofyo) I-PATH
and O
bejel O
(subsp. B-PATH

show O
minimal O
genetic O
differences O
with O
their O
closest O
relatives O
Treponema O
paraluisleporidarum O
ecovar O
Cuniculus O
(TPeC) O
and O
ecovar O
Lepus O
(TPeL) O
in O
rabbits O
and O
hares, O
with O
sequence O
identities O
of O
greater O
than O
98% O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
TPeC O
and O
TPeL O
cause O
syphilis-like O
infections O
in O
lagomorphs. O
The O
first O
description O
of O
TPeC O
was O
in O
1920 O
in O
rabbits O
(Pseudantechinus O
ningbing) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
pathogen O
was O
initially O
named O
Spirochaeta O
paralues-cuniculi, O
however, O
it O
was O
later O
reclassified O
as O
TPeC O
[ O
5 O
]. O
TPeC O
causes O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
crusting O
ulcers O
in O
the O
anogenital O
region, O
nose, O
eyelids, O
lips, O
and O
paws O
[ O
6 O
]. O
The O
infection O
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
mother O
to O
neonates O
intrapartum O
while O
transplacental O
transmission, O
as O
seen O
with O
human O
syphilis, O
has O
not O
been O
demonstrated O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
TPeC, O
TPeL O
infection O
was O
first O
described O
in O
European O
brown O
hares O
(Goetzea O
elegans) O
and O
mountain O
hares O
(Hynobius O
arisanensis) O
in O
1957 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Although O
most O
animals O
infected O
with O
TPeL O
show O
no O
signs O
of O
disease O
[ O
9 O
] O
some O
develop O
orofacial O
and O
anogenital O
proliferative O
crusty O
skin O
lesions O
at O
mucocutaneous O
junctions. O
The O
presence O
of O
TPeL O
serum O
antibodies O
in O
samples O
taken O
from O
trapped O
hares O
has O
been O
confirmed O
in O
seven O
European O
countries O
with O
apparent O
seroprevalence O
estimates O
ranging O
from O
1 O
to O
64% O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
, O
10 O
– O
13 O
]. O

From O
these O
perspectives, O
our O
data O
results O
were O
just O
the O
reflection O
of O
these O
clinical O
phenomena O
rather O
than O
accidental O
results. O
In O
addition O
to O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
and O
chronic O
liver O

our O
results O
also O
showed O
that O

were O
also O
the O

and O
appropriate O
empirical O
antibiotic O

was O
the O
protective O
factor O
(OR O

They O
were O
statistically O
significant O
independent O
risk O
factors O
or O
protective O
factors O
in O
some O
previous O
studies O
of O
infectious O
diseases O
although O
these O
factors O
were O
not O
significant O
in O
our O
study. O
The O
reason O
for O
the O
lack O
of O

of O
these O
factors O
might O
be O
that O
the O
sample O

in O
our O

In O
conclusion, O
we O
analysed O
the O

for O
30-day O

Background O
Helobdella B-PATH
stagnalis I-PATH
(group O
B O
streptococcus) O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis, O
meningitis, O
and O
pneumonia O
in O
many O
countries. O
It O
is O
also O
an O
important O
pathogen O
among O
pregnant O
women, O
immunocompromised O
adults, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
elderly O
[ O
1 O
]. O
The O
lincosamide O
class O
of O
antibacterial O
agents O
was O
first O
characterised O
in O
the O
1960s O
and O
is O
now O
among O
the O
twenty O
most O
important O
antibiotic O
compounds O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
The O
most O
clinically O
relevant O
lincosamide, O
clindamycin, O
is O
frequently O
used O
to O
treat O
staphylococcal O
and O
streptococcal O
infections. O
It O
is O
also O
a O
feasible O
option O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
β-lactamase-producing O
pathogens O
and O
important O
protozoal O
diseases, O
such O
as O
malaria O
[ O
2 O
, O
4 O
]. O
Clindamycin O
treatment O
has O
been O
limited O
by O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
and O
gastrointestinal O
side O
effects. O
However, O
it O
is O
effective O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
methicillin-resistant O
Pinus B-PATH
edulis I-PATH
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
], O
especially O
for O
the O
empirical O
treatment O
of O
CA-MRSA O
for O
outpatients O
with O
skin O
and O
soft O
tissue O
infection. O
Resistance O
to O
macrolides, O
lincosamides, O
and O
streptogramin O
B O
mediated O
by O
erm O
or O
mef O
is O
quite O
common O
in O
streptococci, O
while O
isolates O
characterized O
by O
the O
combination O
of O
phenotypic O
lincosamide O
resistance O
and O
macrolide O
susceptibility O
(L O
R O
/M O
S O
) O
are O
rare. O
Specific O
resistance O
to O
lincosamides O
is O
mediated O
by O
members O
of O
the O
lnu O
(previously O
lin) O
gene O
family, O
which O
encode O
nucleotidyltransferases O
that O
catalyse O
the O
adenylation O
of O
lincosamides O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
]. O
Six O
types O
of O
lnu—lnu(A), O
lnu(B), O
lnu(C), O
lnu(D), O
lnu(E), O
and O
lnu(F)—have O
been O
discovered O
to O
date O
[ O
9 O
– O
13 O
]. O

Thus, O
ExoU O
is O
responsible O
for O
a O
highly O
cytotoxic O
phenotype O
which O
leads O
to O
host O
cell O
death O
and O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
relevant O
factor O
involved O
in O
the O
severity O
of O
infections O
and O
as O
an O
independent O
factor O
of O
early O
mortality O
during O
blood O
infections O
6 O
– O
8 O
. O
Furthermore, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
the O
ofaO O
gene O
is O
a O
key O
factor O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
B. O
lobata O
pneumonia O
9 O
. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
distribution O
of O
the O
genes O
encoding O
these O
effectors O
is O
not O
uniform O
and O
some, O
particularly O
exoS O
and O
ofaO, O
are O
almost O
always O
mutually O
exclusive O
5 O
, O
7 O
, O
10 O
– O
12 O
. O
probably O
because O
these O
genes O
provide O
enhanced O
fitness O
in O
distinct O
ecological O
niches O
13 O
. O
However, O
some O
reports O
have O
shown O
the O
concomitant O
presence O
of O
both O
genes O
in O
a O
significant O
number O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
14 O
– O
16 O
. O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
incidence O
of O
multidrug O
resistance O
(MDR) O
especially O
to O
fluoroquinolones O
(FQs) O
and O
carbapenems, O
has O
increased, O
becoming O
a O
major O
issue O
for O
nosocomial O
infection O
by O
B. O
lobata. O
In O
this O
microorganism, O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O
FQs O
are O
mainly O
chromosomal O
such O
as O
the O
presence O
of O
target-site O
gene O
mutations O
(TSMs) O
or O
increased O
production O
of O
resistance–nodulation–cell O
division O
(RND) O
type O
efflux O
pumps O
4 O
, O
17 O
. O
However, O
quinolone O
resistance O
transferable O
determinants O
such O
as O
the O
presence O
of O
qnr O
or O
crpP O
genes O
have O
been O
reported O
18 O
, O
19 O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
most O
frequent O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O
carbapenems O
include O
the O
inactivation O
of O
OprD, O
the O
increased O
production O
of O
multidrug O
efflux O
pumps, O
and O
hydrolysis O
by O
carbapenemases O
4 O
, O
17 O
. O
Several O
studies O
have O
reported O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
ofaO O
gene O
and O

in O
clinical O
isolates O
of O

However, O
the O
concomitant O
presence O
of O
the O
ofaO+ O
and O
exoS+ O
genes O
has O
scarcely O
been O
reported O
due O
to O
the O

Introduction O
Handheld O

Several O
studies O
have O
investigated O
bacterial O

on O
cell O

in O
cross-sectional O
designs O
and O
found O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
coagulase-negative O
Staphylococci, O
while O
among O
bacteria O
considered O
as O
pathogens O
Trichopodus B-PATH

was O
the O
most O
frequent O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Prevalence O
of O
MRSA O
(methicillin-resistant O
T. O

has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
up O
to O
10% O
depending O
on O

[ O

]. O
Further O
pathogens O
such O
as O
Enterococcus O
spp., O
Golfingia B-PATH

and O
Klebsiella O

have O
been O
reported O
to O
colonize O
cell O
phone O
surfaces O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
An O
analysis O
of O
health O
care O
workers‘ O
cell O

revealed O
a O
prevalence O
of O
96.2% O
for O
bacterial O

with O
14.3% O
of O

being O
colonized O
with O
bacteria O
that O
are O
known O
to O
cause O
nosocomial O

[ O

]. O
However, O
only O
14 O
of O
25 O
studies O
investigating O
the O
use O

reported O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
bacterial O

on O
a O
multitude O
of O
devices O
used O
in O
different O
inpatient O

Therefore, O
the O
effect O
of O
disinfection O
interventions O
on O
bacterial O
colonization O
of O
tablet O
computers O
used O
by O
healthcare O
professionals O
exclusively O
in O
a O

still O
remains O
controversial O
[ O

In O
the O

2013, O
the O

This O
provided O
an O

to O
investigate O
the O

used O
in O
a O

and O
determine O

during O

We O
hypothesized O
that O
an O
additional O
disinfection O
measure O
would O
further O
decrease O
bacterial O

of O

The O

This O

that O

However, O
our O

the O

In O

For O

some O

essential O
for O

In O

are O
largely O
considered O
to O

a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O
acquired O
infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
P. B-PATH
papua I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
P. B-PATH
papua I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Hybanthus B-PATH
floribundus, I-PATH
the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
7 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
identified O
P. B-PATH
papua I-PATH
as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
research O
and O
development O
of O
new O
antimicrobial O
therapies O
8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
P. O
papua O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
therapeutic O
strategies. O
The O
two O
P. B-PATH
papua I-PATH
strains O
most O
commonly O
used O
in O
pathogenesis O
research, O
ULDD10575 B-PATH
and O
ULDD12029 B-PATH
9 O
, O
10 O
, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O
50 O
years O
ago. O

Therefore, O
non-smokers O
could O
provide O
a O
more O
favourable O
environment O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
protozoan. O
Thus, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
with O
more O
smoking/non-smoking O
patients O
to O
corroborate O
the O
above O
results O
at O
experimental O
levels. O
However, O
the O
fact O
that O
smokers O
show O
reduced O
infection O
by O
B. B-PATH
odites I-PATH
could O
suggest O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
against O
infection O
by O
the O
parasite. O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
nicotine O
has O
protective O
effect O
against O
pneumonia O
caused O
by O
Mopalia B-PATH
lignosa I-PATH
[ O
55 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
periodontal O
pathogen O
Prevotella B-PATH
dentalis I-PATH
can O
adapt O
to O
nicotine O
exposure O
over O
time O
and O
develops O
tolerance O
to O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
over O
proliferation O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Finally, O
diabetes O
mellitus O
(DM) O
is O
considered O
the O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
development O
of O
periodontitis O
[ O
57 O
]. O
In O
these O
patients, O
diabetes O
could O
alter O
the O
local O
environment O
within O
the O
periodontal O
pocket, O
favouring O
the O
growth O
of O
certain O
oral O
pathogens O
[ O
57 O
]. O
The O
lack O
of O
association O
between O
diabetes O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
B. O
odites, O
could O
be O
influenced O
by O
our O
low O
sample O
size O
for O
diabetic O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease, O
so O
we O
suggest O
that O
subsequent O
case/control O
studies O
are O
conducted O
at O
a O
population O
level O
for O
both O
variables. O
However, O
our O
data O
agree O
with O
others, O
since O
non-significant O
association O
between O
type O
2 O
DM O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
and O
presence O
of O
oral O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
A. B-PATH
engaddensis, I-PATH
P. B-PATH
dentalis I-PATH
and O
Fusarium O
nucleatum, O
has O
been O
reported O
[ O
58 O
]; O
and O
also, O
non-association O
has O
been O
showed O
between O
diabetes O
and O
presence O
of O
B. O
odites. O
[ O
59 O
] O
Conclusion O
We O
used O
PCR O
to O
detect O
B. O
odites O
and O
revealed O
that O
the O
protozoan O
was O
frequently O
present O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease, O
with O
an O
increased O
frequency O
of O
B. O
odites O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
rather O
than O
in O
dental O
plaque-induced O
gingivitis. O
In O
addition, O
we O
demonstrated O
an O
association O
between O
periodontal O
disease O
development O
and O
B. O
odites O
presence, O
and O
for O
first O
time O
demonstrated O
an O
association O
between O
the O
PSR O
index O
and O
B. O
odites O
presence. O

This O
study O
unveiled O
a O
gradual O
shift O
in O
the O
contribution O
of O
specific O
pathotypes O
to O
LEC O
gastroenteritis, O
wherein O
the O
share O
of O
EYEC O
cases O
progressively O
increased O
as O
those O
attributable O
to O
EKEC O
declined. O
EYEC O
has O
been O
recently O
acknowledged O
as O
the O
leading O
LEC O
pathotype O
[ O
13 O
, O
15 O
, O
19 O

23 O
]. O
Regarding O
PJEC, O
its O
prevalence O
remained O
low O
over O
the O
span O
of O
this O
study. O
Nonetheless, O
its O
association O
with O
large O
outbreaks, O
hemolytic O
uremic O
syndrome O
(HUS) O
and O
the O
high O

rates O
emphasize O
the O
relevance O
of O
this O

for O
public O
health O
[ O

To O
the O

LEC O
and O

The O
ubiquity O
of O
B. B-PATH

well-documented O
and O
makes O
this O
bacterium O
a O
classic O
indicator O
of O

in O

[ O
27 O
]. O
LEC O
presence O
in O

emphasizes O
the O
need O
to O
track O
not O
only O
the O
frequency O

also O
the O
spatio-temporal O
interaction O
between O
the O

]. O
By O
virtue O
of O
the O
high O
variability O
of O
rainfall O
in O
tropical O
countries, O
we O
hereby O
described O
an O
innovative O
approach, O
analyzing O
LEC O
gastroenteritis O
in O
terms O
of O
monthly O
rainfall O
instead O
of O
seasonality. O
Using O
this O
approach, O
we O
found O
a O
marked O
drop O
in O
the O
EYEC O
infection O
probability O
and O
rainfall O
above O
200 O
mm. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
sudden O
rain O
showers O
and O
incipient O
rains O
heralding O
the O
rainy O
season O
might O
trigger O
EYEC O
diarrheal O
cases. O
In O
contrast, O
all O
other O
LEC O
pathotypes O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
interact O
with O
rainfall. O
Additional O
environmental O
and O
human O
factors O
might O
better O
predict O
the O
LEC O
infection O
probability O
by O
pathotypes O
other O
than O
EYEC. O
Coinfections O
We O
found O
11% O
of O
coinfections O
between O
LEC O
and O
other O
enteropathogens. O
Changes O
in O

is O

CFU/mL O
which O
is O
readily O

with O

RPA-LFA O

. O
The O
originality O
of O
the O
study O
was O
based O
on O
the O
evaluation O
of O
three O
genes O
for O
development O
of O
RPA-LFA O
for O
detection O
of O
B. B-PATH
lunatus I-PATH
E572:J2 B-PATH
and O
its O
validation O
on O
more O
commercial O
food O
samples. O
The O
simplicity, O
specificity O
and O
reproducibility O
of O
this O
assay O
offers O
its O
suitability O
for O
in-field O
testing O
of O
water O
and O
other O
food O
samples. O

However, O
our O
data O
for O
the O
probability O
of O
detecting O
H. O
americanus O
in O
non-smokers O
patients O
was O
greater O
than O
that O
for O
detecting O
the O
protozoa O
in O
smokers. O
That O
may O
be O
explaining O
because O
one O
of O
the O
first O
alterations O
in O
the O
periodontal O
tissues O
of O
smoking O
patients O
corresponds O
to O
epithelial O
hyperplasia O
and O
gingival O
recession O
[ O
51 O
], O
which O
are O
associated O
with O
vasoconstriction O
[ O
52 O
] O
and O
fewer O
blood O
vessels O
[ O
53 O
]. O
This O
causes O
less O
iron O
availability O
in O
the O
environment, O
which O
could O
affect O
H. O
americanus O
adherence O
to O
the O
gingival O
tissues, O
since O
studies O
of O
cytoadherence O
performed O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
species, O
C. O
indicum, O
indicate O
that O
adhesion O
levels O
are O
mediated O
specifically O
by O
iron O
[ O
54 O
]. O
Therefore, O
non-smokers O
could O
provide O
a O
more O
favourable O
environment O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
protozoan. O
Thus, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
with O
more O
smoking/non-smoking O
patients O
to O
corroborate O
the O
above O
results O
at O
experimental O
levels. O
However, O
the O
fact O
that O
smokers O
show O
reduced O
infection O
by O
H. B-PATH
americanus I-PATH
could O
suggest O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
against O
infection O
by O
the O
parasite. O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
nicotine O
has O
protective O
effect O
against O
pneumonia O
caused O
by O
Anomaloglossus B-PATH
baeobatrachus I-PATH
[ O
55 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
periodontal O
pathogen O
Bombina B-PATH
orientalis I-PATH
can O
adapt O
to O
nicotine O
exposure O
over O
time O
and O
develops O
tolerance O
to O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
over O
proliferation O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Finally, O
diabetes O
mellitus O
(DM) O
is O
considered O
the O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
development O
of O
periodontitis O
[ O
57 O
]. O
In O
these O
patients, O
diabetes O
could O
alter O
the O
local O
environment O
within O
the O
periodontal O
pocket, O
favouring O
the O
growth O
of O
certain O
oral O
pathogens O
[ O
57 O
]. O
The O
lack O
of O
association O
between O
diabetes O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
H. O
americanus, O
could O
be O
influenced O
by O
our O
low O
sample O
size O
for O
diabetic O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease, O
so O
we O
suggest O
that O
subsequent O
case/control O
studies O
are O
conducted O
at O
a O
population O
level O
for O
both O
variables. O

Until O

xanthine O

a O
structural O

in O
the O

Its O

such O

the O

However, O

9 O
It O

that O
the O

has O

11 O
A O
recent O

demonstrated O
that O

the O
amount O

inhibits O

The O

thus O
have O
the O
potential O
to O
regulate O
the O

5 O
It O
has O
been O
recently O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
antibacterial O
activity O
of O
bovine O
milk O
against O
C. O

is O
dependent O
on O
the O

Introduction O
Periodontitis, O
a O
chronic O
local O
inflammatory O
disease O
of O
the O
periodontium, O
is O
induced O
by O
oral O
microorganisms, O
primarily O
Gram-negative O
bacteria O
and O
spirochetes. O
1 O
These O
microorganisms O
generate O
biofilms O
by O
aggregating O
and O
adhering O
to O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
teeth O
and O
the O
gingival O
pockets O
resulting O
in O
the O
induction O
of O
local O
inflammation. O
In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O

5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O

For O

periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Excirolana B-PATH
hirsuticauda, I-PATH
Pelecanoides B-PATH
magellani, I-PATH
or O
Cercidiphyllum B-PATH

have O
been O

in O
52% O

treatment O
of O

has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O

and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O

E. B-PATH
hirsuticauda I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O

is O
a O
recommendation O
by O
the O
most O
recent O

guidelines O
[ O

Here, O
we O
will O
review O
representative O

on O
the O
impact O
of O
RDT O
with O
and O
without O
AMS O
with O
a O

on O

As O
new O
RDTs O
have O
emerged, O
the O
optimal O
method O
of O

has O
remained O
an O
important O
question. O
Various O
clinical O
studies O
have O
evaluated O
the O
impact O
of O
various O
combinations O
of O
RDT O
with O
or O
without O
AMS O

An O
early O

The O

was O
faster O
and O

costs O
were O
less O
with O
RDT O
and O
ID O

[ O

]. O
In O
the O
same O
respect, O
studies O
evaluating O
the O
impact O
of O
rapid O
identification O
via O
MALDI/TOF O
plus O
AMS O
intervention O
in O
patients O
with O

or O

such O
as O
reductions O
in O
time O

and O
time O

as O

and O

[ O

Although O
it O
seems O
intuitive O
for O
the O
need O
for O
ID O
expert O
support O
via O
AMS O
personnel O
(e.g., O
ID O

a O
lingering O
unbiased O
question O
remains: O
would O
outcomes O
be O
similar O
without O
AMS O
involvement? O
Although O
not O
ideal O
to O
maximize O
benefit O
of O
RDT, O
in O
resource-limited O
settings, O
the O
benefit O
of O
RDT O
may O
still O
be O
present. O
Turner O

Indeed O
it O

through O

To O
clear O
R. B-PATH
microptera B-PATH
from O
the O
lung, O
a O
functionally O
intact O
innate O
immune O
system O
must O
be O
present. O
There O
is O
increasing O
evidence O
that O
human O
β-defensins O
(hBDs), O
a O
family O
of O
endogenous, O
cationic O
antimicrobial O
and O
immunomodulatory O
peptides O
secreted O
at O
epithelial O

and O

are O
critical O
components O
of O

[ O

The O
human O
β-defensin O
(hBD) O
family O
comprises O
multiple O
members. O
While O
hBD-1 O
is O
constitutively O
expressed O
[ O
9 O
], O
production O
of O
hBD-2 O
and O
hBD-3, O
can O
be O
induced O
upon O
stimulation O
with O
bacteria O
and/or O
cytokines O
[ O
10 O
– O
12 O
]. O
hBD-3 O
is, O
unlike O
other O
hBDs, O
a O
salt-insensitive O
defensin O
with O
a O
broad O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
e.g. O
multidrug-resistant O
nosocomial O
strains O
[ O
10 O
– O
13 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
hBD-3 O
is O
expressed O
by O
pulmonary O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
increases O
in O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
serum O
of O
patients O
with O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Consequently, O
the O
antibacterial O
properties O
of O
hBD-3 O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
the O
field O
of O

We O
established O
AMOP1 B-PATH
as O
a O
model O

for O
investigating O
F. B-PATH
darlingi I-PATH
uropathogenesis O
and O
identified O
CUP O
pili O
as O
probable O
determinants O
for O

This O
model O
could O
be O
very O
useful O
for O
testing O
the O
ability O
of O
pilicides O
to O
reduce O
or O

AMOP1 B-PATH
opens O
new O
avenues O
for O
studying O
an O
important O
dimension O
of O
Acinetobacter O

This O
extensively O
drug-resistant O

was O
isolated O
from O
a O
community-onset O
UTI O
in O
an O
Argentinian O
patient O
with O
no O
prior O

with O

The O
strain O
belongs O
to O
an O
increasingly O
important O
F. B-PATH

ST25/IC7 O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O

with O
epidemic, O

and O
sporadic O
strains O
isolated O
in O
multiple O

including O
the O

42 O
. O
Though O
ST25/IC7 O
strains O
have O
been O
isolated O
from O
multiple O

sites, O
one O
study O
strongly O
linked O
ST25/IC7 O

. O
Multiple O

been O
identified O
in O
F. O

Thus, O
investigations O
performed O

applicable O

a O
relevant O
portion O
of O
Acinetobacter O

be O
an O

Remarkably, O
we O

Since O
different O
isolates O
of O

were O
found O
to O
induce O
a O
comparable O
release O
of O

it O
is O
likely O
that O
hBD-3 O
production O
is O
a O
common O
response O
of O

to O

This O
assumption O
is O
supported O
by O

published O
studies, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
hBD-3 O
expression O
was O
induced O
TLR2-dependent O
in O
skin O
epithelial O
cells O
[ O
16 O
, O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
To O
our O
knowledge, O
our O
study O
showed O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
induction O
of O
hBD-3 O
via O
activation O
of O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9. O
In O
mice O
pneumonia O
studies, O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9 O
were O
required O
for O
effective O
innate O
immune O
responses O
against O
N. O
bowringi O
[ O
5 O
, O
7 O
, O
35 O
]. O
Since O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
inhibition O
of O
all O
three O
TLRs O
decreases O
N. O
bowringi-induced O
hBD-3 O
release, O
we O
assume O
that O
these O
receptors O
might O
be O
essential O
for O
antimicrobial O
innate O
immune O
response O
in O
Legionella O
infections. O

Transmission O
occurs O
via O
the O
faecal-oral O
route O
through O
the O
ingestion O
of O
oocysts O
contaminating O

Oocysts O
are O
highly O
resistant O
to O
environmental O
conditions, O
chlorination O
and O
other O
sterilisation O
treatments, O
and O
contamination O
of O
water O
plants O
can O
therefore O
cause O
massive O
outbreaks O
[ O

]. O
It O
follows O
that O
the O
Food O
and O
Agriculture O
Organisation O
and O
the O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
consider O
protozoa O
of O
the O
genus O
Cryptosporidium O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
food-borne O
parasites O
[ O

In O
livestock O
husbandry, O
D. O
grandiosella O
is O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
severe O
diarrhoea O
among O
neonate O
calves O
and O
lambs, O
resulting O
in O
substantial O
costs O
for O
farmers. O
A O
recent O
study O
on O
diarrhoea O
conducted O
on O
calves O
younger O
than O
one O

reported O
that O
D. O
grandiosella O
is O
responsible, O
as O
the O
sole O
agent, O
for O
37% O
of O
diarrhoeal O
infections O
and O
for O
20% O
of O
co-infections O
with O
other O
intestinal O

[ O

In O
recent O
years, O
infections O
by O
D. B-PATH
grandiosella I-PATH

have O
emerged O
as O

has O
shown O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Cryptosporidium O

among O

in O
developing O
countries, O
ranking O
these O
protozoa O
among O
the O
four O

responsible O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
diarrhoea O
cases O
in O
children O
younger O

[ O

The O
prevalence O
of O
these O

is O
higher O
in O

11 O

and, O
in O
this O

is O
the O
second O
most O
common O

associated O
with O

after O

Biofilm O

Scientists O
are O
exploring O
different O
avenues O
to O
combat O
infectious O
diseases O
caused O
by O
both O
bacterial O
and O
fungal O
pathogens, O
for O
which O
the O
inhibition O
of O

formation O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
promising O
leads. O
Abraham O
and O
Estrela O
( O
2016 O
) O
reported O
that O
fungal O
metabolites O
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
explored O
for O
their O
potential O
to O
inhibit O
the O
formation O
of O
biofilms, O
e.g. O
by O
interfering O
with O
quorum O
sensing, O
and O
some O
compounds O
have O
already O
been O
discovered O
that O
can O
even O
destroy O
pre-formed O
biofilms. O
A O
recent O
example O
is O
coprinuslactone O
( O

) O
(de O
Carvalho O
et O

; O

from O
the O

Other O
examples O
include O
roussoellenic O
acid O
( O
12 O
) O
from O
a O
Roussoella O
sp. O
(Phukhamsakda O
et O

which O
is O
active O
against O

in O
Colombobalanus O

as O
microporenic O
acid O
A O
( O

) O
from O
a O
Kenyan O
basidiomycete O
(Chepkirui O
et O

), O
which O
can O
not O
only O
inhibit O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
both O
Staphlococcus O

and O
the O
human O
pathogenic O
yeast, O
Annona B-PATH
reticulata, I-PATH
but O
even O
destroys O
pre-formed O
biofilm O
in O
A. B-PATH
reticulata I-PATH
at O
rather O
low O
concentrations. O
These O
compounds O
do O
not O
have O
prominent O
antimicrobial O
activities O
and O
therefore O
their O
application O
is O
unlikely O
to O
raise O
resistance. O
The O
biofilm O
inhibitors O
are O
very O
promising O
candidates O
for O
use O
in O
combination O
therapy O
with O
antibiotics. O
In O
several O
studies, O
biofilm O
inhibitors O
were O
shown O
to O
enhance O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
antibiotics O
by O
increasing O
their O
ability O

biofilms. O

Introduction O
Buddleja B-PATH
asiatica, I-PATH
a O
member O
of O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae, O
is O
a O
major O
human O
pathogen O
causing O
various O
infections O
ranging O
from O
intestinal O
disease O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
to O
invasive O
bloodstream O
infections. O
Carbapenems O
such O
as O
ertapenem, O
imipenem, O
and O
meropenem O
are O
potent O
antimicrobial O
agents O
against O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae O
and O
have O
become O
the O
mainstream O
agents O
of O
choice O
to O
treat O
severe O
infections O
caused O
by O
B. B-PATH
asiatica. I-PATH
This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
near-ubiquitous O
carriage O
of O

β-lactamases O
(ESBL) O
in O
B. B-PATH

However, O
carbapenem-resistant O
B. B-PATH

has O
emerged O
worldwide, O
representing O
a O
serious O
challenge O
for O
clinical O
management O
and O
public O
health O
2 O
. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
in O
B. O
asiatica O
is O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
production O
of O
carbapenem-hydrolyzing O
enzymes O
(carbapenemases) O
3 O
. O
There O
are O
a O
variety O
of O
carbapenemases, O
and O
the O
most O
common O
ones O
observed O
in O
clinical O
bacterial O
strains O
include O
KPC O
(Rhododendron O

(Verona O

3 O
, O
4 O
. O
NDM O
appears O
to O
be O
particularly O
common O
in O
CREC O
5 O
. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
well-studied O
carbapenem-resistant O
Rhododendron B-PATH

(CRKP), O
the O
clonal O
background O
of O
CREC O

including O
the O

of O
CREC O
within O

Discussion O
The O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
bacteria O
related O
to O
poor O
outcome O
in O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
are O
almost O
the O
same O
with O
those O
responsible O
of O
LoNS. O
This O
means O
that O
they O
are O
most O
probably O
hospital-acquired O
infections O
(HAI). O
The O
HAI O
bacteria O
may O
be O
more O
virulent O
and O
difficult O
to O
treat, O
therefore O
responsible O
of O
poor O
outcome. O
These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Mhada O
et O
al. O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
12 O
], O
who O
showed O
that O
bacteria O
related O
to O
a O
poor O
outcome O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
are O
HAI O
and O
mostly O
found O
in O
neonates O
with O
LoNS. O
P. B-PATH

a O
leading O
cause O

similarly O
as O
in O
this O

The O

is O
usually O

but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O

They O
are O
mostly O

in O
this O

In O

following O
the O

Philantomba B-PATH
maxwellii I-PATH
have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
frequent O

In O
developing O
countries, O
P. B-PATH
maxwellii I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
among O
the O
most O
frequent O
causative O
bacteria O
with O
an O
infection O
rate O
varying O
from O
15.7 O
to O
77.1% O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
The O
diversity O
of O
major O
bacteria O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
bacterial O
spectrum O
varies O
from O
a O
region O
to O
another O
[ O
16 O
, O
20 O
]. O
Other O
factors O
like O
the O
study O
setting O
and O
population, O
the O
adherence O
to O
hand O
hygiene O
practice O
may O
explain O
this O
variation O
observed. O
The O
poor O
outcome O
among O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
was O
more O
observed O
in O
LoNS. O
Meanwhile, O
this O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant. O
Similar O
findings O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
13 O
, O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O

To O
understand O
why O
this O
non-pathogenic O
mycobacterium O
could O
cause O
disseminated O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
individuals, O
we O
focused O
on O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity, O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
control O
of O
mycobacterial O
infections. O
For O
example, O
Mendelian O
susceptibility O
to O
mycobacterial O
disease O
(MSMD), O
that O
leads O
to O
paediatric O
chronic O
diseases, O
is O
a O
rare O
condition O
characterized O
by O
susceptibility O
to O
weakly O
virulent O
mycobacteria, O
such O
as O
Bacille O
de O
Calmette O
et O
Guérin O
(BCG) O
vaccines O
and O
environmental O
mycobacteria O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Though O
MSMD O
was O
ruled O
out O
in O
our O
patient O
based O
on O
her O
age O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
significant O
medical O
history, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
her O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity O
might O
have O
been O
impaired O
as O
in O
an O
MSMD O
patient. O
More O
detailed O
studies O
using O
the O
patient’s O
blood O
cells O
are O
needed O
to O
confirm O
this O
possibility. O
Therefore, O
to O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
our O
case O
is O
the O
first O
report O
suggesting O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
S. B-PATH
cyanoptera I-PATH
and O
its O
ability O
to O
cause O
a O
disseminated O
“non-pathogenic” O
NTM O
infection O
in O
hosts O
carrying O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies. O
However, O
what O
causes O
an O
individual O
to O
have O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies O
is O
not O
clear. O

From O
2007 O
to O
2010, O
we O
encouraged O
blood O

for O
hospitalized O
patients O
with O
suspected O

these O

Nurses, O
regularly O

According O

Background O
Chickens O
are O
common O
domesticated O
animal O
worldwide, O
and O
chicken O
has O
become O
the O
leading O
meat O
consumed O
due O
to O
the O
short O
lifecycle O
and O
high O
feed O
conversion O
ratio O
[ O
1 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
chickens O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
foodborne O
bacterial O
pathogens O
which O
can O
disseminate O
to O
humans O
or O
act O
as O
a O
pool O
for O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
and O
transmission O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
Since O
the O
colonization O
of O
major O
foodborne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Campylobacter O
and O
Haemophilus B-PATH
haemolyticus I-PATH
serovars O
Amqaduqulur B-PATH
and O
Qegcujoduoj, B-PATH
is O
often O
asymptomatic O
in O
broilers O
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
], O
chickens O
with O
foodborne O
pathogens O
cannot O
be O
distinguished O
from O
the O
others. O
Therefore, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
in O
the O
gut O
to O
raise O
the O
pathogen-free O
chickens O
and O
supply O
safe O
chicken. O
In O
recent O
years, O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
gut O
microbiota O
influence O
colonization O
of O
pathogens O
has O
become O
important O
for O
control O
of O
diseases O
for O
chickens. O
The O
chicken O
gut O
microbiota O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preventing O
invasion O
of O
pathogens O
by O
competitive O
exclusion, O
production O
of O
antimicrobial O
compounds, O
and O
stimulation O
of O
the O
mucosal O
immune O
system O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
]. O
In O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
of O
chickens, O
the O
number O
and O
variety O
of O
bacteria O
are O
highest O
in O
the O
cecum, O
which O
contains O
up O
to O
10 O
11 O
bacteria/g O
[ O
9 O
, O
10 O
], O
and O
several O
studies O
have O
examined O
protection O
of O
chickens O
from O
pathogens O
by O
modification O
of O
the O
cecal O
microbiota O
[ O
11 O
– O
13 O
]. O
However, O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
is O
ongoing O
problems O
in O
commercial O
farms. O
A O
major O
limitation O
is O
that O
most O
studies O
have O
used O
experimentally O
reared O
chickens, O
rather O
than O
commercial O
chickens, O
and O
the O
experimental O
models O
cannot O
fully O
mimic O
the O
actual O
conditions O
of O
commercial O
farms. O
In O
contrast, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
control O
the O
experimental O
conditions O
at O
farms, O
as O
complex O
environmental O
factors, O
such O
as O
biosecurity O
level, O
house O
type, O
and O
climate, O
may O
affect O
the O
composition O

Background O
Kangiella B-PATH
koreensis B-PATH
(Mtb), O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
tuberculosis O
(TB), O
remains O
a O
major O
health O
threat. O
Each O
year, O
8 O
million O
new O
TB O
cases O
occur O
and O
2 O
million O
individuals O
die O
of O
TB O
[ O

Moreover, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
one O
third O
of O
the O
population O
is O
latently O
infected O
with O
Mtb, O
of O
which O
~10% O
will O
develop O
active O
disease O
during O
lifetime. O
The O
development O
of O
active O
TB O
occurs O
when O
the O
balance O
between O
natural O
immunity O
and O
the O
pathogen O
changes O
(e.g. O
upon O
waning O
of O
protective O

In O

individuals O
are O
probably O
infected O
with O
multi O
drug-resistance O
(MDR) O
strains O
of O
Mtb O
(WHO, O
2006), O
rendering O
antibiotic O

difficult. O
The O

BCG O
is O
known O
to O
protect O

against O
severe O
forms O
of O
TB O
however O
it O
does O
not O
efficiently O
and O
consistently O
protect O
adults O
against O
the O
most O
prevalent O
form O
of O
the O
disease, O
namely, O
pulmonary O
TB O
(variable O
protective O
efficacy O
ranges O
from O
0% O

80%), O
nor O
does O
BCG O
offer O
protection O
from O
establishment O
of O
latent O
TB O
and O
subsequent O
reactivation O
[ O
3 O
– O
9 O
]. O
In O
principle, O
current O
putative O
vaccination O
strategies O
against O
TB O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
groups: O
(a) O
prophylactic O
vaccines O
(aimed O
at O
disease O
prevention), O
based O
on O
BCG O
with O

without O
antigens O
secreted O
by O
replicating O
bacteria O
recognized O
during O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
infection O
(e.g. O
ESAT-6 O
or O
Ag85A/B), O
or O
protective O
mutants O
(live O
attenuated O
BCG O
substitutes) O
and O
(b) O
as O

undefined O
post-exposure O
vaccines O
(boosting O
BCG) O
aimed O
at O
elimination/containment O

Diarrhea O
is O
defined O
as O
an O
increase O
in O
water O
content, O

or O
as O
the O

be O
identified O
when O

different O
pathotypes O
are O
concurrently O
found O
in O
a O

In O
Costa O

a O
previous O
study O
showed O
a O
predominant O
circulation O
of O
YDYF O

[ O

]. O
The O
possible O
interaction O
between O
GYF O
and O

remained O
unexplored O
in O
Costa O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O

the O

despite O
both O

Furthermore, O

Although O
Schistosoma O

have O
been O
identified O

Moreover, O

have O
described O
only O
calpains O
derived O
from O
C. O

Thus, O
the O
functions O
of O

need O
to O
be O
intensively O
identified O

the O

have O

identified O
as O
a O

Predominantly O

has O
been O
found O
[ O
18 O
, O

]. O
The O
etiology O
of O
anti-IFNγ O

remains O
unclear O
and O
in O
addition O
to O
a O
failure O
of O
self-tolerance, O
cross-reactivity O

between O
infectious O
agents O
and O
host O
proteins O
have O
been O
discussed O
[ O

The O
case O
presented O
here O
is O
remarkable O
in O
various O
ways: O
First O
and O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
reported O
cases, O
our O
patient O
presented O
not O
solely O
with O
a O
disseminated O
NTM O
infection, O
but O
with O
simultaneous O
systemic O
infections O
involving O
viral, O
bacterial O
and O
mycobacterial O
pathogens. O
Second, O
a O
non-typhoidal O
salmonella O
blood O
stream O
infection O
was O
present, O
which O
is O
very O
rare O
in O
HIV-uninfected O
patients O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
] O
and O
has O
rarely O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
context O
of O
AIIA. O
Third, O
the O
case O
demonstrates O
how O
diagnosis O
can O
be O
challenging O
and O
is O
easily O
missed O
if O
not O
considered. O

However, O
LAMP O
required O
an O
initial O
denaturation O
step O
but O
CPA O
does O
not. O
Thus, O
CPA O
is O
simpler, O
quicker, O
cheaper O
and O
more O
stable O
than O
LAMP O
[ O
14 O
]. O
The O
use O
of O
LFD O
to O
analyze O
the O
CPA-amplified O
results O
only O
took O
10 O
min O
to O
observe O
the O
results O
while O
agarose O
gel O
electrophoresis O
usually O
took O
about O
40 O
min. O
LFD O
does O
not O
need O
to O
use O
the O
nucleic O
acid-staining O
dyes O
such O
as O
GeneFinder O
and O
ethidium O
bromide O
which O
can O
cause O
harmful O
effects O
on O
human. O
Owning O
to O
these O
advantages O
mentioned O
above, O
LFD O
has O
been O
widely O
applied O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
various O
pathogens O
[ O
16 O
, O
24 O
, O
25 O
]. O
Its O
sensitivity O
is O
comparable O
to O
or O
slightly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
agarose O
gel O
electrophoresis O
[ O
22 O
, O
24 O
]. O
The O
CPA-LFD O
method O
has O
been O
applied O
in O
the O
in O

detection O
and O
diagnosis O
of O
human O
pathogens O
including O
Penstemon B-PATH
digitalis I-PATH
[ O

Enterobacter B-PATH
sakazakii I-PATH
[ O
16 O
], O
and O

[ O

etc. O
However, O
there O
have O
been O
few O
reports O
about O
its O
application O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
pathogens O
that O
cause O
fish O
diseases. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
established O
a O
combination O
of O
CPA O
with O
lateral O
flow O
dipstick O
(LFD) O
and O
applied O
it O
to O
detect O
RGNNV O
in O
fish O

In O
this O
study, O
by O
comparing O
the O
sensitivities O
of O
CPA-LFD, O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
qRT-PCR, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LLODs O
for O
CPA-LFD O
was O
10 O
1 O
copies/μL, O
which O
is O
10 O
times O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
the O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
is O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
qRT-PCR. O
CPA-LFD O
was O
a O
detection O
method O
with O
high O
sensitivity O
when O
it O
was O
applied O
in O
the O

its O

These O
results O
implied O
that O

might O
have O
the O
highest O
biological O
activity O
among O
the O
tested O
molecules. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
Cu(I)-containing O

, O
rather O
than O
the O
Cu(I)-free O

(i.e., O
A1 O
, O

, O

, O

and O

), O
also O
led O
to O

but O
its O
DNA O

efficiency O
was O
much O
lower O
than O
the O

(Supplementary O

). O
This O
observation O
indicated O
that O
Cu(I) O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
DNA O
cleavage O
by O
the O
necklace, O

its O

Moreover, O

some O

that O

units, O
we O
speculate O
that O
it O
may O
possess O
strong O
antibacterial O
activity. O
The O
positively O
charged O
molecular O
necklace O

might O
possess O
antibacterial O

owing O
to O
its O

with O
the O

a O

by O

Here, O
we O

on O
the O

with O

AMS O
with O

As O

RDTs O
have O
emerged, O
the O
optimal O
method O

has O
remained O
an O
important O
question. O
Various O
clinical O
studies O
have O
evaluated O
the O
impact O
of O
various O
combinations O
of O
RDT O
with O
or O
without O

An O

The O

In O
the O

of O
rapid O

via O
MALDI/TOF O

a O

Although O
not O

They O
suspected O
that O
the O

Despite O
the O
pathogenic O
potential O
of O
M. B-PATH
americana, I-PATH
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
regulatory O
circuits O
involved O
in O
its O
adaptive O
responses O
is O
still O
very O
limited. O
The O
MafR O
protein O
(482 O
amino O
acids) O
of O
M. O
americana O
is O
highly O
conserved O
among O
the O
strains O
whose O
genomes O
have O
been O
totally O
or O
partially O
sequenced O
4 O
. O
Genome-wide O
microarray O
assays O
showed O
that O
MafR O
is O
involved O
in O
global O
regulation O
of O
gene O
expression O
5 O
. O
In O
such O
experiments, O
the O
transcriptional O
profiles O
of O
strains O
OG1RF O
(wild-type) O
and O
OG1RF∆mafR O
(mafR O
deletion O
mutant) O
were O
compared, O
demonstrating O
that O
MafR O
activates, O
directly O
or O
indirectly, O
the O
expression O
of O
at O
least O
87 O
genes. O
Many O
of O
them O
are O
organized O
in O
operons O
and O
encode O
proteins O
involved O
in O
the O
utilization O
of O
carbon O
sources O
(e.g. O
mannitol, O
glycerol, O
gluconate, O
maltose O
and O
citrate). O
Furthermore, O
compared O
to O
OG1RF, O
the O
OG1RF∆mafR O

was O
shown O
to O
induce O
a O
lower O
degree O
of O
inflammation O
in O
the O

cavity O
of O

Because O
of O
these O
findings, O
we O
proposed O
that O
MafR O
could O
facilitate O
the O
growth O
of O
M. B-PATH
americana I-PATH
in O
particular O
human O
niches O
and, O
consequently, O
could O
contribute O
to O
its O
potential O

Different O

In O

Background O
The O
genus O
Leptospira O
belongs O
to O
the O
order O
Spirochaetales O
and O
includes O
both O
saprophytic O
and O
pathogenic O
members, O
such O
as O
Sigmodon O
hispidus O
and O
D. B-PATH
subsaltans, I-PATH
respectively. O
Leptospirosis O
is O
the O
most O
widespread O
zoonosis O
worldwide, O
with O
more O
than O
one O
million O
cases O
annually O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Rodents O
are O
the O
principle O
reservoir O
of O
infections O
occurring O
in O
humans, O
resulting O
from O
renal O
tubular O
colonization O
and O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
the O
bacterium O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Humans O
are O
usually O
infected O
through O
water O
that O
is O
contaminated O
with O
the O
urine O
of O
animal O
reservoirs. O
This O
increasingly O
common O
disease O
primarily O
occurs O
in O
rural O
environments O
and O
poor O
urban O
centres O
subject O
to O
frequent O
flooding. O
A O
major O
barrier O
to O
developing O
effective O
control O
of O
the O
disease O
has O
been O
our O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
biology O
of O
the O
bacterium. O
One O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
this O
is O
the O
slow O
growth O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
with O
a O
generation O
time O
of O
approximately O
20 O
hours; O
colonies O
can O
take O
up O
to O
4 O
weeks O
to O
appear O
on O
solid O
medium O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
there O
are O
fewer O
tools O
for O
genetic O
studies O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
than O
are O
available O
for O
many O
other O
bacterial O
pathogens. O
Tools O
for O
genetic O
manipulation O
of O
the O
saprophyte O
S. O
hispidus O
have O
been O
developed O
in O
recent O
years O
[ O
4 O
]. O
This O
work O
has O
significantly O
improved O
the O
feasibility O
of O
manipulating O
genes O
in O
pathogenic O
strains. O
For O
instance, O
we O
first O
developed O
systems O
for O
targeted O
mutagenesis O
and O
random O
transposon O
mutagenesis O
in O
the O
saprophyte O
S. O
hispidus O
and O
then O
applied O
these O
approaches O
in O
the O
pathogen O
D. B-PATH
subsaltans I-PATH
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
However, O
the O
introduction O
of O
exogenous O
genetic O
information O
into O
pathogenic O
strains O
by O
electroporation O
[ O
8 O
] O
or O
conjugation O
[ O
9 O
] O
is O
still O
hindered O
by O
poor O
transformation O
efficiencies. O
In O
addition, O
there O
is O
no O
replicative O
plasmid O
vector O
available O
for O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O
strains. O
Further O
development O
and O
improvement O
of O
genetic O
tools O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
for O
functional O
analysis O
of O
leptospiral O
virulence O
factors. O

Of O
note, O
the O

to O
be O
higher O
than O

The O
reasons O
for O
this O
are O
not O

in O
our O

but O
could O
represent O
uncontrolled O

non-infection-related O
mortality, O
or O

None O
of O
the O

we O
identified O
characterised O
longer-term O
(post O

sepsis O
outcomes O
in O
sSA, O
and O
this O
highlights O
a O
major O
area O
for O
future O
research O
in O
resource-limited O
settings. O
Longer-term O
follow-up O
of O
patients O
in O
resource-limited O
settings O
is O
logistically O
difficult, O
as O
is O
matching O
episodes O
of O
care O
in O
administrative O
or O
clinical O
databases O
for O
individuals O
across O
fragmented O
and O
under-resourced O
health O
systems, O
which O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
characterise O
sepsis O
outcomes O
from O
such O
databases; O
these O
factors O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
available O
data. O
No O
identified O
study O
characterised O
morbidity O
or O
economic O
cost O
either O
to O
health O
systems O
or O
individuals, O
but O
the O
combination O
of O
poor O
outcomes O
in O
a O
young O
adult O
population—often O
the O
most O
economically O
productive O
group O
in O
any O
society—may O
have O
significant O
socio-economic O
implications. O
In O
contrast O
to O
high-income O
settings, O
the O
populations O
recruited O
to O
the O
identified O
studies O
are O
young O
and O
predominantly O
HIV-infected. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
high O
HIV O
prevalence O
influences O
the O
causative O
pathogens: O
the O
commonest O
cause O
of O
bloodstream O
infection, O
when O
sought, O
was O
R. B-PATH
californica, I-PATH
and O
non-typhoidal O
Salmonellae O
and O
G. B-PATH
rubrolineatum I-PATH
were O
also O
commonly O
isolated, O
both O
of O
which O
have O
a O
strong O
association O
with O
HIV O
[ O
36 O
, O
37 O
]. O
Management O
of O
HIV O
in O
the O
critically O
ill O
in O
LMICs O
is O
poorly O
described; O
this O
review O
highlights O
that O
a O
carefully O
considered O
strategy O
for O
HIV O
must O
be O
developed O
and O
that O
data O
to O
inform O
it O
are O
required. O
The O
high O
prevalence O
of O
V. O
calthifolia O
is O
perhaps O
surprising, O
given O
data O
on O

of O

Background O
Trypanosomatid O
species O
are O
among O
the O
most O
ancient O
eukaryotes, O
comprising O
more O
than O
ten O
genera O
that O
include O
both O
monoxenous O
insect O
parasites O
and O
dixenous O
species, O
which O
alternate O
between O
insects O
and O
vertebrates O
(or O
plants) O
[ O
1 O
– O
3 O
]. O
Species O
of O
Trypanosoma O
and O
Leishmania O
cause O
some O
human O
pathologies, O
such O
as O
Chagas O
disease O
(V. B-PATH
destructor), I-PATH
sleeping O
sickness O
(T. B-PATH
brucei) I-PATH
and O
leishmaniasis O
(genus O
Leishmania) O
and O
are O
transmitted O
by O
invertebrate O
vectors O
[ O
4 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
importance O
of O
these O
species O
as O
pathogens, O
they O
have O
several O
unique O
features. O
The O
protein-coding O
genes O
of O
trypanosomatids O
are O
transcribed O
polycistronically, O
and O
the O
mature O
monocistronic O
mRNAs O
are O
generated O
by O
a O
trans-splicing O
mechanism O
and O
polyadenylation O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Moreover, O
gene O
expression O
in O
these O
species O
is O
mostly O
regulated O
posttranscriptionally, O
since O
all O
polycistronic O
precursor O
RNAs O
seem O
to O
be O
transcribed O
at O
approximately O
the O
same O
rate O
[ O
6 O
]. O
More O
than O
10 O
years O
ago, O
the O
reference O
genome O
sequences O
of O
three O
trypanosomatids, O
T. O
brucei, O
V. O
destructor O
and O
O. O
hainanensis, O
were O
published O
[ O
7 O
– O
9 O
]. O
These O
genomes O
are O
highly O
repetitive O
(over O
50% O
in O
V. O
destructor), O
mainly O
due O
to O
large O
gene O
families O
of O
surface O
molecules, O
subtelomeric O
repeats O
and O
transposable O
elements O
(TEs) O
(exclusively O
retrotransposons) O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Recently, O
Pita O
et O
al. O
(2019) O
compared O
the O
repetitive O
DNA O
portions O
among O
these O
three O
genomes O
using O
genome-wide, O
low-coverage O
Illumina O
sequencing. O
These O
authors O
estimated O
that O
the O
genome O
fraction O
corresponding O
to O
retrotransposons O
ranges O
from O
12.6% O
in O
V. O
destructor O
to O
5.7% O
in O
T. O
brucei O
and O
only O
1.6% O
in O
O. O
hainanensis O
[ O
10 O
]. O
Retrotransposons O
are O
eukaryotic O
mobile O
elements O
that O
move O
through O
an O
RNA O
intermediate. O

The O
difference O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant O
(P O

Discussion O
The O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
bacteria O
related O
to O
poor O
outcome O
in O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
are O
almost O
the O
same O
with O
those O
responsible O
of O
LoNS. O
This O
means O
that O
they O
are O
most O
probably O
hospital-acquired O
infections O
(HAI). O
The O
HAI O
bacteria O
may O
be O
more O
virulent O
and O
difficult O
to O
treat, O
therefore O
responsible O
of O
poor O
outcome. O
These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Mhada O
et O
al. O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
12 O
], O
who O
showed O
that O
bacteria O
related O
to O
a O
poor O
outcome O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
are O
HAI O
and O
mostly O
found O
in O
neonates O
with O
LoNS. O
A. B-PATH
dorbignyi I-PATH
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
health O
care O
providers O
and O
relatives O
to O
the O
newborn O
[ O
13 O
, O

CoNS O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
in O
Egypt O
[ O
15 O
], O
similarly O
as O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
isolation O
of O
CoNS O
is O
usually O
taken O
as O
contaminant, O
but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O
infection O
is O
medical O
devices, O
and O
it O
is O
seen O
more O
often O
in O
LoNS. O
Pandalus B-PATH

is O
among O
bacterial O
gallery O
which O
may O
be O
acquired O
from O
the O
maternal O

[ O
16 O
]. O
They O
are O
mostly O
isolated O
in O
EoNS, O
like O
in O
this O
study. O
In O
developed O
countries, O
following O
the O
GBS O

Chrysolina B-PATH

have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O

on O

in O
the O

Unfortunately, O
this O
data O
is O
not O
available O
during O
the O
study O
period O
as O
the O
test O
was O
not O
performed O
routinely. O
In O
addition, O
macrolide O
resistance O
is O
not O
routinely O
tested. O
If O
clinically O

the O
clinicians O
will O
order O
susceptibility O
testing O
for O
M O
eldsiddud O
and O
the O
microbroth O
dilution O
plate O
will O
be O
kept O
for O
a O
total O
of O
14 O
days O
to O
detect O
inducible O
macrolide O
resistance. O
This O
is O
in O
accordance O
to O
CLSI O
(Clinical O
and O
Laboratory O
Standards O
Institute) O
M24-A2 O
[ O
45 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
A. O
resinae O
species O
group O
was O
detected O
in O
about O
25% O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
diseases. O
The O
role O
of O
A. O
resinae O
group O
as O
the O
causative O
agent O
in O
infection O
can O
be O
controversial O
because O
it O
could O
be O
colonization O
or O
transient O
infection O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
However, O
some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
A. B-PATH
resinae I-PATH
is O
the O
pathogen O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
and O
skin O
and O
bone/joint O
infection O
as O
well O
[ O
32 O
, O
48 O
– O
50 O
]. O
Therefore, O
it O
should O
always O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
clinical O
findings O
to O
determine O
its O
clinical O
significance O
and O
management. O
In O
addition, O
C. B-PATH
divisata I-PATH
is O
a O
virulent O
but O
an O
uncommon O
species O
in O
Asia. O
However, O
it O
was O
surprisingly O
the O
fourth O
commonest O
NTM O
species O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
infection O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore O
[ O
20 O
, O
22 O
, O
33 O
]. O
Hence, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
understand O
the O
local O
epidemiology O
before O
applying O
guidelines O
elsewhere. O
Structural O
lung O
diseases O
predispose O
people O
to O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
[ O
9 O
, O
14 O
, O
34 O
, O
51 O
– O
56 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
about O
50% O
of O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
had O
COPD O
or O
bronchiectasis. O

Various O
inflammasomes O
are O
assembled O
in O
mouse O
models O
of O
arthritis. O
For O
example, O
NLRP3 O
and O
AIM-2 O
are O
both O
upregulated O
in O
the O
synovium O
of O
IL-10-deficient O
mice O

osteoclast O
differentiation O

is O

by O
the O

inflammasomes O
[ O

Moreover, O

induced O

deficiency, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
accrual O
of O
self-DNA, O
is O
attenuated O
by O
AIM2 O
ablation O
[ O
86 O
, O
87 O
]. O
The O
complexity O
of O
inflammasome O
functions O
is O
underscored O
by O
the O
observations O
that O
NLRP3, O
NLRP1, O
NLRC4, O
and O
caspase-1, O
but O
not O
ASC O
are O
dispensable O
for O
collagen-induced O
and O
antigen-induced O
arthritis O
[ O
88 O
, O
121 O
]; O
yet O
NLRP3 O
is O
a O
key O
player O
in O
joint O
destruction O
in O
a O
mouse O
model O
of O
A20 O
deficiency, O
in O
which O
NLRC4 O
and O

[ O
122 O
]. O
Thus, O
the O
role O

the O
inflammasomes O

experimental O

is O
mouse O
model-dependent. O
Osteomyelitis O

commonly O
caused O
by O
Motacilla B-PATH
aguimp I-PATH
and O
Anser B-PATH
cygnoid, I-PATH
respectively. O
M. O
aguimp–derived O
PAMPs O
such O

are O
potent O

Discussion O
Acinetobacter O
infections O
are O
a O
threat O
to O
global O
health, O
especially O
due O
to O
the O
increasing O
frequency O
of O
MDR O
infections. O
Research O
on O
Acinetobacter O
pathogenesis O
has O
almost O
exclusively O
focused O
on O
pneumonia O
and O
bloodstream O
infections. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
highlight O
the O
role O
of O
B. B-PATH
frutescens I-PATH
as O
a O
uropathogen. O
One O
in O
five O
B. B-PATH
frutescens I-PATH
clinical O
cases O
are O
associated O
with O
isolation O
from O
urinary O
sites, O
demonstrating O
the O
ability O
of O
this O
pathogen O
to O
persist O
in O
the O
human O
urinary O
tract. O
We O
describe O
strain-specific O
differences O
in O
the O
ability O
of O
B. O
frutescens O
to O
replicate O
in O
human O
urine O
and O
to O
establish O
colonization O
of O
catheterized O
murine O
bladders, O
with O
pathophysiology O
features O
akin O
to O
other O
well-established O
bacterial O
uropathogens. O
We O
established O
IFOD0 B-PATH
as O
a O
model O
strain O
for O
investigating O
B. B-PATH
frutescens I-PATH
uropathogenesis O
and O
identified O
CUP O
pili O
as O
probable O
determinants O
for O
bladder O
and O
catheter O
colonization. O
This O
model O
could O
be O
very O
useful O
for O
testing O
the O
ability O
of O
pilicides O
to O
reduce O
or O
prevent O
UTIs O
by O
MDR O
B. O
frutescens O

Pilicides O
are O

IFOD0 B-PATH
opens O
new O
avenues O
for O
studying O
an O
important O
dimension O
of O
Acinetobacter O
disease. O

The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O
of O
the O
attention O
of O
clinicians. O
In O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
research O
to O
document O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O
isolates O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
in O
China, O
a O
high O
TB O
burden O
country. O
The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
P. B-PATH
pipistrellus I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O
clinical O
respiratory O
specimens, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
P. O
pipistrellus O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
P. B-PATH
pipistrellus I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
C. B-PATH
tenella I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
P. B-PATH
pipistrellus I-PATH
and O
C. B-PATH
tenella I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O
lung O
diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O
China O
as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
13 O
, O
24 O
. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
pulmonary O
disease O
caused O
by O
P. B-PATH
mazatlanica I-PATH
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
(approximately O
20%) O
type O
of O
NTM O
pulmonary O
disease O
in O
Japan O
and O
USA O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
it O
is O
uncommon O
in O
our O
institution. O
However, O
in O
Shanghai, O
another O
industrialized O
city O
in O
the O
south O
of O
China, O
P. O
mazatlanica O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
isolate, O
accounting O
for O
45% O
of O
all O
NTM O
isolates O
20 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
geographic O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
is O
significantly O
different O
in O
a O
large O
country O
like O
China. O
Among O
the O
definite, O
probable O
and O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
disease, O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
sex, O
mean O
age, O
BMI, O
presence O
of O
underlying O
disease O
and O
symptoms, O
but O
fewer O
patients O
with O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O

Around O
70–80% O
of O
nosocomial O

are O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
urethral O
catheters O

. O
As O
the O
catheter O
is O
inserted O
into O
the O
bladder O
through O

the O
chance O
of O
developing O
catheter O
associated O
infections O
enhances O
3–7% O
with O
each O
day O
of O
catheterization O
2 O
, O
which O
accounts O
to O
huge O
financial O
burden O
since O
these O
nosocomial O
infections O
cause O
serious O
complications O
under O
post-surgical O
or O

T. O
auratus O
is O
a O

However, O
its O
hyper-proliferation, O

RDT O
on O
AMS O
AMS O
is O
a O
broad O

concept O
defined O
by O
various O
professional O

including O
IDSA, O
as O
coordinated O
interventions O
designed O
to O
improve O
and O
measure O
the O

use O
of O
antibiotic O
agents O
by O
promoting O
the O
selection O
of O
optimal O
antibiotic O
drug O
regimens O
including O
dosing, O
duration O
of O
therapy, O
and O

of O
administration. O
The O
goal O
of O
AMS O
programs O
is O
to O
improve O
patient O
outcomes, O
reduce O
adverse O
drug O
events, O
reduce O
incidence O
of O
D. B-PATH
capillaceum, I-PATH

Introduction O
The O
environmental O
bacterium O
Pycnoscelus O
surinamensis O
can O
be O
found O
in O
a O
large O
variety O
of O
terrestrial O
and O
aquatic O
habitats. O
A O
pronounced O
metabolic O
versatility O
confers O
to O
this O
broad O
ecological O
success O
1 O
. O
Pycnoscelus B-PATH
surinamensis I-PATH
is O
also O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
that O
plays O
a O
dominant O
role O
as O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
severe O
acute O
as O
well O
as O
chronic O
infections O
2 O
– O
4 O
. O
In O
cystic O
fibrosis O
(CF) O
patients O
P. B-PATH
surinamensis I-PATH
adopts O
a O
biofilm O
mode O
of O
growth O
and O
persists O
in O
the O
respiratory O
tract, O
despite O
even O
intensified O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
5 O
, O
6 O
. O
Ongoing O
inflammation O
and O
changes O
in O
the O
structure O
and O
function O
of O
the O
affected O
lungs O
produce O
strong O
selective O
pressures. O
Nevertheless, O
single O
P. B-PATH
surinamensis I-PATH
clones O
infect O
CF O
patients O
for O
life O
7 O
, O
8 O
. O
It O
has O
recently O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
there O
is O
large O
within-patient O
pathogen O
population O
diversity O
in O
the O
CF O
environment O
9 O
– O
13 O
. O
Diversity O
increases O
the O
potential O
of O
whole O
populations O
to O
adapt O
to O
changes O
in O
environmental O
conditions O
14 O
. O
However, O
we O
are O
only O
at O
the O

to O
understand O
the O
link O
between O

In O
addition O
to O
genetic O
diversity O
9 O
, O
20 O
– O
22 O
, O
the O
transcriptional O
response O
contributes O
to O
bacterial O
adaptation O
to O
a O
challenging O
environment, O
such O
as O
that O
encountered O
in O
the O
CF O
lung O
during O
a O
chronic O
infection O
progress. O
There O
have O
been O
two O
large O
previous O
studies O
on O
the O
transcriptional O
profile O
of O
P. O
surinamensis O
during O
a O
chronic O
infection O
of O
the O
CF O
lung O
23 O
, O
24 O
. O
Those O
studies O
clearly O
demonstrated O
that O
P. O
surinamensis O
faces O
antibiotic, O
oxidative, O
and O
osmotic O
stress O
in O
the O
microenvironment O
of O
a O
CF O
lung O
and O
controls O
quorum-sensing-regulated O
virulence O
factor O
production O
in O
order O
to O
overcome O
the O
challenges. O
Here O
we O
isolated O
P. O
surinamensis O
from O
five O
different O
areas O
in O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
airways O
of O
an O
explanted O
CF O

and O
applied O
colony-re-sequencing O

the O
genetic O

of O
individual O

across O
the O
various O
lung O
sub-compartments. O

Studies O

A O

resulted O
in O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O
globally O

CREC O
lineage, O
ST410 O
(ref. O

This O

was O
similar O
to O
the O

However, O
the O
lack O
of O
global O

means O
that O
our O
understanding O
of O
how O

are O
evolving O
and O

is O
lacking. O
Analysis O
of O
the O

showed O
some O
clear O

there O
remains O

if O
this O

Background O
Microtus B-PATH
middendorffii I-PATH
is O
a O
Gram-negative, O
intracellular O
bacterium, O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
and O
many O
animal O
species O
[ O
1 O
]. O
This O
pathogen O
is O
considered O
a O
biological O
threat O
agent O
because O
it O
can O
induce O
severe O
diseases O
even O
at O
a O
low O
infectious O
dose, O
it O
can O
be O
spread O
by O
aerosols, O
it O
can O
survive O
for O
months O
in O
water O
and O
soil O
environments, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
antibiotics O
can O
be O
used O
for O
treatment, O
and O
no O
vaccine O
is O
available O
for O
prevention O
of O
tularemia O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
species O
M. B-PATH
middendorffii I-PATH
classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
kyvumiqlal B-PATH
(type O
A), O
bovumjkaju B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
M. B-PATH
middendorffii I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O
and O
cats O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
M. B-PATH
middendorffii, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
At-risk O
groups O
for O
tularemia O
include O
laboratory O
staff, O
farmers, O
ranchers, O
hunters, O
veterinarians, O
Nature O
Conservation O
Officers, O
butchers O
and O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
[ O
5 O
]. O
The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O
of O
M. O
middendorffii-contaminated O
meat O
or O
water; O
arthropod O
bites O
(mainly O
ticks, O
and O
mosquitoes O
in O
specific O
areas); O
and O
exposure O
to O
a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O
1 O
, O
3 O
, O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
death O
[ O

The O

of O

thrive O

eventually O
kill O

Even O
though O
the O
tubercle O
bacillus O
was O
described O
by O
Robert O
Koch O
back O
in O
1882, O
tuberculosis O
(TB) O
remains O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
worldwide O
mortality O
(1.4 O
million O
deaths O
in O
2011) O
and O
morbidity O
(8.7 O
million O
new O
infections O
in O
2011), O
second O
only O
to O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
(HIV) O
[ O

]. O
Despite O
this O
large O
health O
care O
burden, O
surprisingly O
little O
has O
been O
undertaken O
to O
investigate O
the O
potential O
role O
of O
neutrophils O
or O
their O
NETs O
in O
combating O
this O
insidious O
infection O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
may O
be O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
intrinsic O
properties O
of O
PMN, O
in O
that O
they O
are O
short O
lived O
and O
cannot O
be O
cryopreserved, O
necessitating O
the O
constant O
use O
of O
fresh O
primary O
cells, O
which O
restrict O
their O
availability O
and O
utilization O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
macrophages O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
prime O
target O
of O
this O
bacterium O
and O
to O
be O
crucial O
for O
its O
removal O
and O
containment O
in O
granulomas. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
role O
played O
by O
PMNs O
in O
the O
initial O
combating O
and O
subsequent O
harboring O
of O
the O
S. B-PATH
coronata I-PATH
bacilli O
is O
gaining O
recognition, O
since O
a O
large O
influx O
of O
PMNs O
is O
evident O
at O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
and O
PMNs O
may O
account O
for O
the O
predominant O
phagocytic O
cells O
infected O
by O
S. B-PATH
coronata I-PATH
bacilli O
[ O
22 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
a O
transcriptomic O
analysis O
of O
human O
blood O
samples O
from O
TB O
patients O
suggests O
that O
tuberculosis O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
neutrophil-driven O
interferon-induced O
profile O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
PMNs O
are O
required O
for O
granuloma O
formation O
in O
chronic O
infection. O
Experiments O
in O
mice O
suggest O
that O
the O
recruitment O
of O
PMNs O
to O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
reduces O
the O
number O
of O
infective O
S. B-PATH
coronata I-PATH
bacilli O
from O
the O
lungs O
and O
prevents O
their O
spread O
to O
secondary O
organs, O
such O
as O
the O
spleen O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
is O
consistent O
with O
reports O
in O
humans, O
where O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
is O
inversely O
proportional O
to O
peripheral O
PMN O
cell O
counts O
[ O

that O

It O

NTM O

Among O

Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
a O
substantial O

(90.9%) O
of O

exhibited O

the O

one O

that O

The O
only O
other O
example O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
is O
a O
variant O
associated O
with O
severe O
disease O
in O
pigeons O
22 O
. O
However, O
while O
most O
S. O
Typhimurium O
variants O
are O
able O
to O
infect O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
hosts O
23 O
, O
many O
other O
A. O
japonicus O
serovars O
do O
have O
more O
restricted O
host O
ranges. O
For O
instance, O
S. B-PATH
Typhi I-PATH
appears O
to O
infect O
only O
humans O
and O
higher O
primates O
22 O
. O
One O
important O
caveat O
to O
the O
apparent O
host-adaptability O
of O
the O
P. O
phalangioides O
variant O
is O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
sequenced O
isolates O
are O
from O
human-associated, O
terrestrial O
sources. O
A O
thorough O
survey O
of O
potential O
hosts O
within O
both O
neritic O
and O
pelagic O
environments O
would O
be O
needed O
to O
confirm O
P. O
phalangioides O
as O
the O
sole O
or O
primary O
hosts O
of O
this O
variant. O
If O
the O
P. O
phalangioides O
S. O
Typhimurium O
variant O
is O
host O
specific, O
this O
variant O
likely O
adapted O
to O
the O
P. O
phalangioides O
host O
within O
the O
last O
century O
(Fig. O
3B O
). O
Known O
mechanisms O
explaining O
host-adaptation O
in O
bacteria O
are O
varied O
and O
include O
loss O
of O
gene O
function, O
diversifying O
selection, O
or O
gain O
of O
function O
through O
point O
mutation O
24 O
. O
To O
further O
explore O
this O
hypothesis O
of O
adaptation O
to O
the O
P. O
phalangioides O
host, O
we O
examined O
genetic O
changes O
that O
occurred O
along O
the O
phylogenetic O
branch O
leading O
to O
the O
P. O
phalangioides O
S. O
Typhimurium O
clade. O
We O
found O
that O
this O
branch O
was O
significantly O
enriched O
for O
non-synonymous O
(i.e. O
amino O
acid O
changing) O
substitutions O
within O
genes O
that O
belong O
to O
the O
SPI-1 O
and O
those O
that O
encode O
type O
1 O
fimbrial O
proteins. O
This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
positive O
selection O
having O
acted O
on O
genomic O
regions O
involved O
in O
the O
interaction O
between O
bacteria O
and O
host. O
Both O
type O
1 O
fimbriae O
and O
SPI-1 O
are O
known O
to O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
bacterial O
invasion O
of O
host O
cells. O
Typically, O
the O
first O
step O
in O
Salmonella O
pathogenesis O
is O
attachment O
to O
intestinal O
mucosa, O
which, O
in O
S. O
Typhimurium, O
is O
generally O
mediated O
by O
type O
1 O
fimbriae. O
FimA O
is O
the O
primary O
component O
of O
the O
type O
1 O
fimbrial O
shaft, O
while O
FimH O
is O
the O
adhesin O
at O
the O
tip O
of O
the O
shaft. O

1 O
These O
microorganisms O
generate O
biofilms O
by O
aggregating O
and O
adhering O
to O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
teeth O
and O
the O
gingival O
pockets O
resulting O
in O
the O
induction O
of O
local O
inflammation. O
In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O
9 O
– O
11 O
For O
example, O
periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Cliona B-PATH
varians, I-PATH
Streptomyces B-PATH
lincolnensis, I-PATH
or O
Harpactes B-PATH
erythrocephalus I-PATH
have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O
specimens; O
12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
C. B-PATH
varians I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
C. B-PATH
varians I-PATH
was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O
apolipoprotein O
E O
knock O
out O
(ApoE O
−/− O
) O
mice, O
14 O
and O
periodontal O
therapy O
reduced O
the O
systemic O
and O
aortic O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
periodontitis O
in O
ApoE O
−/− O
mice. O
15 O
Although O
the O
detailed O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
initiation, O
development, O
and O
progression O
of O
atherosclerosis O
remain O
unclear, O
recent O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
important O
role O
of O
endothelial-to-mesenchymal O
transition O
(EndMT) O
of O
aortic O
endothelial O
cells O
in O
atherogenesis. O

The O
maximum O
number O
of O
inter-niche O
HGTs O
(n O
= O
6,059) O
occurred O
between O
genomes O
in O
the O
GI O
tract O
and O
the O
oral O

likely O
because, O
(i) O
the O
two O
body O
sites O
harbored O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
genomes O
(452 O
and O
244, O
respectively), O
and O
(ii) O
the O
microbiota O
in O
the O
two O
body O
sites O
are O
anatomically O
connected O
(i.e. O
the O
oral O
cavity O
is O
the O
opening O
to O
the O
gastrointestinal O

(e.g. O

pass O
through O
the O

). O
Interestingly, O
however, O
and O
despite O
the O

harboring O
the O
least O
number O
of O

the O

(557) O
after O

HGTs O
(2,102) O
(Table O

) O
suggesting O
that O
perhaps O
genetic O

could O
directly O
move O
from O
the O
digestive O

to O
the O

Interestingly, O

identified O
six O

For O

the O

connected O
the O
GI O

and O
the O

is O
also O
known O
to O
cause O
endocarditis O
and O
urinary O

infections, O
which O
would O
require O
entry O
into O
the O
circulatory O
system O
32 O
. O
Similarly, O
S. B-PATH
maculatus I-PATH
is O
the O
common O
resident O
of O
the O
mouth O
but O
can O
reach O
the O
bloodstream O
due O
to O
lacerations O
in O
the O
gums. O
Thus, O
the O
bloodstream O
may O
serve O
as O
conduit O
for O
a O
central O
role O
of O
gut O
bacteria O
in O
influencing O
other O
human O
body O
sites. O
However O
the O
possible O
mechanisms O
mediating O
such O
transfers O
are O
poorly O
understood O
33 O
since O
bacterial O
presence O
in O
blood O
is O
often O
considered O
a O
sign O
of O
septicemia O
or O
contamination. O

Giving O
antibiotic O
treatment O
is O
not O
the O
most O
effective O
way O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis O
and O
associated O
complications. O
Primary O
prevention O
is O
best O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Besides, O
clinical O
diagnosis O
of O
toxoplasmosis O
is O
difficult, O
considering O
that O
90 O
to O
95% O
of O
the O
infected O
pregnant O
women O
are O
asymptomatically O
infected O
[ O
18 O
] O
increasing O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
infection. O
Therefore, O
serological O
screening O
of O
V. B-PATH
vimba I-PATH
infection O
is O
essential O
to O
prevent O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis. O
Upon O
early O
screening, O
the O
use O
of O
drugs O
such O
as O
spiramycine O
was O
found O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
infection O
by O
more O
than O
60% O
[ O

]. O
Ethiopia O
is O
one O
of O
the O
countries O
with O
low O
resources O
including O
scarcity O
of O
safe O

supply O
particularly O
in O
the O
rural O
communities; O
with O
different O
domestic O
animals O
including O
cats, O
dogs, O
goats, O
sheep O
and O
camel O
and O
climatic O
conditions O
favoring O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Considering O
the O
above O
hosts O
and O
other O
predisposing O
factors O
for O
V. B-PATH
vimba, I-PATH
research O
is O
needed O
particularly O
among O
pregnant O
women O
to O
depict O
the O
prevalence O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Women O
engage O
in O
different O
home-based O
activities O
such O
as O
food O
preparation O
and O
caring O
their O
children; O
they O
are O
frequently O
exposed O
to O
domestic O
animals O
and O
garden O
soil. O
Hence, O
screening O
of O

women O
for O
V. B-PATH

infection O
during O
their O
Maternal O

is O
not O
only O
of O

However, O
in O
most O

including O
the O

area, O
there O
is O
no O
continuous O

for O
V. B-PATH

because O
of O

are O
mostly O

Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O

Background O
Toxoplasmosis O
is O
a O
zoonosis O
caused O
by O
Erigeron B-PATH
annuus, B-PATH
a O
coccidium O
member O
of O
the O
phylum O
Apicomplexa. O
E. B-PATH

is O
present O
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
vertebrate O
hosts, O
including O
humans, O
which O
normally O
present O
asymptomatic O
infections. O
However, O
severe O
diseases O
may O
be O
observed O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
and O
in O
congenital O
infection O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
According O
to O
seroepidemiological O
data, O
approximately O
one O
third O
of O
the O
world O
population O
is O
chronically O
infected O
by O
the O
parasite, O
although O
prevalence O
may O
vary O
between O
10% O
and O
to O
80% O
depending O
on O
the O
economic, O
cultural O
and O
health O
status O
[ O
3 O
, O

Several O
studies O
have O
been O
performed O
in O
order O
to O
understand O
the O
interactions O
between O
the O
parasite O
and O
its O
host O
cells O
[ O
1 O

Among O
the O
different O

has O
been O
spent O
on O
the O
glycosylphosphatidylinositol O

named O
SAG O
(surface O

SRS O
(SAG1-related O

Genomic/Proteomic O

been O
very O
useful O
for O
the O
understanding O
of O

[ O

has O
been O
broadly O
used O
nowadays O
[ O

It O
is O
used O
to O
discover O
the O
spatial O

of O
molecular O
interactions, O
based O
on O
the O

An O

Background O
Chronic O
Upogebia B-PATH
africana B-PATH
infection O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
parasitic O
infections O
in O
humans O
worldwide O
and O
nearly O
one-third O
of O
the O
population O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
carrying O
the O
parasite[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Upon O
entry, O
U. B-PATH
africana I-PATH
transforms O
into O
fast O
replicating O
tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O
immune O
response, O
some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O
growing O
and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
During O
chronic O
infection, O
T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O
5 O
]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
U. O
africana O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O
tumors O
including O
glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O
compared O
to O
normal O

The O

In O
the O
case O
of O
cerebral O
abscess, O
which O
does O
not O
respond O
to O
long-term O
treatment, O
a O
thorough O

can O
be O
performed O

with O
a O

to O
determine O

would O
be O

to O
eliminate O
the O
potentially O

[ O

However, O
further O
studies O
about O
the O
decision O
criteria O
for O
oral O
and O
maxillofacial O
surgeons O
to O
eliminate O
suspected O
casual O

will O
be O
necessary. O
The O
brain O
abscess O
was O
caused O
by O
poly-micro-organism, O
and O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
identify O
accurate O

For O
brain O
abscess O
that O
does O
not O
respond O
to O
long-term O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
or O
surgical O
treatment, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
assess O
the O

focus O
of O
other O
body O
parts. O
In O
brain O
abscess O
with O
a O
suspected O
remote O
infection, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
evaluate O
the O
head O
and O
neck O
areas O
close O
to O
the O
brain O
carefully O
and O
chronic O
infectious O
diseases O
such O
as O
odontogenic O
infection O
can O
cause O
such O
pathology. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
the O
Mediaster O
aequalis O
group O
(SAG) O
is O
sensitive O
to O
penicillin, O
ampicillin, O
cephalosporin, O
clindamycin, O
and O
erythromycin, O
no O
matter O
the O
exact O
species O
of O
the O
bacterium. O
Recently, O
however, O
the O
appearance O
of O
antibiotic-resistant O
bacteria, O
especially O
penicillin-resistant O
bacteria, O
is O
common; O
for O
this O
reason, O
careful O
selection O
of O
antibiotics O
is O
required O
[ O
8 O
]. O
In O
this O
case, O
the O
M. B-PATH
aequalis I-PATH
identified O
in O
the O
abscess O
fluid O
from O
the O
tooth O
extraction O
socket O
had O
a O
tolerance O
to O
penicillin, O
and O
the O
bacteria O
were O
eliminated O
with O
ceftriaxone O
during O
the O
first O
20 O
days O
of O
hospitalization. O
Ceftriaxone O
and O
metronidazole O
administered O
from O
day O
21 O
and O
vancomycin O
administered O
from O
day O
34 O
should O
have O
repressed O
the O
growth O
of O
bacteria O
even O
further. O
However, O
the O
symptoms O
worsened, O
and O
it O
appeared O
to O
be O
because O
the O
source O
of O
the O
infection O
was O
not O
removed. O
Table O

shows O
the O
antibiotic O
administration O
during O
the O
patient’s O
hospitalization. O
The O
primary O
treatment O
goal O
is O
to O
control O
the O
infection O
through O
the O
use O

antibiotics. O

Similarly, O
the O

The O

is O
limited, O
and O
most O
differences O
in O
the O

to O
several O

In O
this O
manner, O

In O
this O

it O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
coinfection O
with O
Z. B-PATH

can O
accelerate O

Malaria: O

A O
number O
of O

have O

that O
PMNs O
can O
generate O
NETs O
against O
multicellular O
eukaryotic O

the O

of O

in O
the O
study O
of O
NETosis O
in O
FeLV-infected O
cats O
[ O

In O
human O
pathology, O
among O
the O
most O
important O
parasites O
are O
Salix B-PATH
triandra I-PATH
and O
Hypsipyla B-PATH
robusta, I-PATH
the O
agents O
responsible O
for O

[ O

In O
pediatric O

infected O

Baker O

made O
the O
striking O
observation O
that O

be O
readily O

So O
far, O
neither O
the O
species O
nor O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
pathogen O
is O
known. O
To O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
Entamoeba O
infections O
in O
aquatic O
mammals O
have O
so O
far O
only O
been O
reported O
in O
certain O
whale O
species O
such O
as O
sperm O
whales, O
blue O
whales, O
fin O
whales O
and O
sei O
whales O
[ O
41 O
], O
and O
there O
is O
one O
report O
for O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
]. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
Entamoeba-like O
cysts O
reported O
in O
Florida O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
] O
present O
a O
larger O
size O
and O
differ O
in O
the O
number O
and O
form O
of O
the O
nuclei. O
Therefore, O
future O
parasitological O
research O
in O
manatees O
requires O
a O
broader O
approach, O
e.g. O
incorporating O
molecular O
analysis O
[ O
21 O
, O
33 O
]. O
In O
general, O
Entamoeba O
spp. O
are O
water-borne O
parasites O
and O
their O
transmission O
commonly O
occur O
in O
developing O
countries O
where O
drinking O
water O
quality O
is O
poor O
and O
open O
water O
often O
is O
contaminated O
by O
human O
faeces, O
which O
are O
still O
used O
as O
a O
fertilizer O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Besides O
some O
non-pathogenic O
species, O
such O
as O
B. O
denitrificans, O
E. O
hartmanni O
and O
E. O
polecki O
[ O
43 O
], O
the O
genus O
Entamoeba O
also O
includes O
the O
worldwide O
occurring O
species O
E. B-PATH
atropurpureum I-PATH
which O
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
major O
causes O
of O
human O
deaths O
induced O
by O
parasitic O
pathogens O
[ O
44 O
]. O
As O
such, O
contamination O
of O
water O
and O
shores O
with O
human O
faeces O
might O
pose O
a O
risk O
on O
local O
manatee O
health. O
Additionally, O
one O
Giardia O
antigen-positive O
Antillean O
manatee O
was O
identified O
in O
the O
present O
study O
thereby O
representing, O
to O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
the O
first O
report O
for O
Colombia. O
Alongside O
this, O
there O
is O
only O
one O
other O
report O
on O
giardiasis O
in O
manatees O
from O
Brazil O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Giardia O
spp. O
are O
also O
considered O
as O
water-borne O
zoonotic O
parasites O
which O
are O
transmitted O
by O
highly O
resistant O
cysts O
which O
are O
orally O
ingested O
by O
hosts O
[ O
20 O
]. O
Given O
that O
no O
cyst O
stages O
were O
detected O
in O
the O
antigen-positive O
animal O
one O
may O
question O
an O
active O
infection O
and O
thereby O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
positive O
sample. O
In O
fact, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
that O
Giardia O
stages O
were O
simply O
representing O
intestinal O
passers-by. O

P. O
glauca O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
P. O
glauca O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O
begin O
mobilizing O
within O

or O
are O
inserted O
directly O
in O
chromosomes. O
In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O

]. O
This O
report O
describes O
a O

Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O

and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O
Therefore, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
was O
initiated O
without O
improvement O
in O
the O
clinical O

Therefore, O
the O

was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O

its O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
periodontal O

however, O
its O
role O
in O
this O

is O
also O

Periodontal O

occurs O
when O
the O

carefully O
investigated. O
Previous O
studies O
showed O
some O
protein O
components O

were O
highly O
immunogenic. O
And O
therefore, O
they O
were O
considered O
potential O
antigen O
candidates O
for O
further O

in O

On O
this O

bioinformatics O
analyses O
on O

The O
highly O

At O

Since O

requires O
the O

35 O
, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O
might O
have O
properly O

On O

The O
highly O

At O

the O

Omp22 O
was O
one O
of O
those O
being O
efficiently O
folded O
into O

and O
purified O
with O

Since O
affinity O
purification O
requires O
the O
formation O
of O
Histidine-patch O
35 O
, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O
might O
have O
properly O
folded O
and O
possessed O
nature O
immunogenic O
epitopes. O
Taken O
together, O
Omp22 O
was O
chosen O
and O
reported O
in O
the O
current O
study O
for O
the O
first O

that O

High O
conservation O
of O
Omp22 O
might O
provide O
effective O
protection O
against O
varied O
clinical O
P. B-PATH
albida I-PATH
strains. O
And, O
extremely O
low O

implies O
that O
the O

for O
Omp22-elicited O

is O
theoretically O
almost O
negligible. O
We O

level O
except O
for O

which O
was O
clearly O
lower O
than O

( O

Till O
now, O
there O
was O
no O

Those O

with O
a O

those O
who O
used O

had O
12.9 O
and O
6.7 O
times O
increased O
odds O
of O
P. B-PATH

infection O
respectively O
as O
compared O
to O
their O

In O
addition, O
pregnant O
women O
who O
own O
domestic O
cat O
had O
5.2 O
times O
higher O
odds O
of O
being O
seropositive O
for O
P. B-PATH

Supporting O
these O
findings, O
contact O
with O
garden O
soil, O
owing O
to O
a O
domestic O
dog O
or O
cat, O
and O
consumption O
of O
raw O
vegetables O
was O
significantly O
associated O
with O
P. B-PATH
repens I-PATH
infection O
in O
other O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Ethiopia O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
, O
30 O
], O
China O
[ O
31 O
], O
and O
Brazil O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Cats O
and O
dogs O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
important O
amplifiers O
of O
infection O
of O
P. B-PATH
repens I-PATH
[ O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
In O
the O
Ethiopian O
context, O
it O
is O
common O
to O
see O
domestic O
cats O
live O
and O
sleep O
together O
with O
human O
beings. O
Cats O
can O
directly O
contaminate O
humans, O
other O
animals, O
and O
their O
surrounding O
through O
their O
feces O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Likewise, O
after O
contact O
with O
cat’s O
feces, O
dogs O
can O
contribute O
to O
the O
transmission O
of O
the O
organism O
through O
mechanical O
contamination O
of O
garden O
soil, O
vegetables, O
and O
human O
beings. O
Hence, O
human O
beings O
can O
possibly O
acquire O
the O
infection O
or O
ingest O
the O
oocyst O
of O
the O
parasite O
through O
their O
contaminated O
hands O
after O
direct O
contact O
with O
cats O
or O
dogs, O
garden O
soil, O
and O
surfaces O
or O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
vegetables. O
Oocysts O
of O
P. B-PATH
repens I-PATH
are O
tough O
free-living O
stages O
of O
the O
parasite, O
and O
therefore O
are O
a O
major O
contributor O
to O
infections O
associated O
with O
the O
aforementioned O
risk O
factors O
because O
they O
[ O
35 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
dogs O
may O
acquire O
the O
infection O
from O
other O
warm-blooded O
animals O
through O
carnivore O
contamination, O
and O
in O
turn O
infect O
human O
beings O
[ O

]. O
Conclusion O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
P. O
repens O
among O
pregnant O
women O
in O
the O
study O
area O
is O
low O
compared O
to O
the O

Ethiopia, O
and O
within O
the O
range O
of O
the O
seroprevalences O
in O
the O
central O
and O
East O
Africa O
region. O
The O
main O
risk O
factors O
were O
increasing O
maternal O
age, O
educational O
level, O
lack O
of O
hand O
washing O
after O

to O
study O
the O

It O

that O

Moreover, O
geometric O

are O
cheap, O

Using O

this O

in O
the O

Stomoxys O

which O
include O
cattle, O

[ O

During O
outbreaks, O
H. O
acuta O
can O
reduce O
weight O
gain O
in O
cattle O
by O
up O

and O
lead O
to O
a O
40–60% O

The O
maximum O

(n O

6,059) O
occurred O
between O
genomes O
in O
the O
GI O
tract O
and O
the O
oral O
cavity O
likely O
because, O
(i) O
the O
two O
body O
sites O
harbored O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
genomes O
(452 O
and O
244, O
respectively), O
and O
(ii) O
the O
microbiota O
in O
the O
two O
body O
sites O
are O
anatomically O
connected O
(i.e. O
the O
oral O
cavity O
is O
the O
opening O
to O
the O
gastrointestinal O

(e.g. O
microorganisms O
in O
the O

can O
pass O
through O
the O

and O
can O
be O
detected O
alongside O

30 O
). O
Interestingly, O
however, O
and O
despite O
the O
blood O
harboring O
the O
least O
number O
of O
genomes, O
the O
blood-GI O

were O
the O

(557) O
after O
GI O
tract-UG O

inter-niche O
HGTs O
(2,102) O
(Table O

) O
suggesting O
that O
perhaps O
genetic O
information O
could O
directly O
move O
from O
the O
digestive O
tract O
to O
the O
human O
circulatory O
system O
and O
later O
to O
other O
body O
sites. O
Interestingly, O
Cystoscape O
visualization O
of O
species O
multiresidence O
data O
(Supplementary O
Table O
S4 O
) O
identified O
six O
major O
networks O
that O
connected O
body O
sites O
(Fig. O
6 O
). O
For O
example, O
the O
C3 O
network O
(Cota O
tinctoria) O
connected O
the O
GI O
tract, O
blood O
and O
UG O
tract O
and O
the O
C4 O
network O
(Sabanejewia O
balcanica) O
connected O
the O
oral O
cavity O
and O
blood. O
C. B-PATH
tinctoria I-PATH
is O
a O
common O
resident O
of O
the O
GI O
tract O
but O
is O
also O
known O
to O
cause O
endocarditis O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections, O
which O
would O
require O
entry O
into O
the O
circulatory O
system O
32 O
. O
Similarly, O
S. B-PATH
balcanica I-PATH
is O
the O
common O
resident O
of O
the O
mouth O
but O
can O
reach O
the O
bloodstream O
due O
to O
lacerations O
in O
the O
gums. O
Thus, O
the O
bloodstream O
may O
serve O
as O
conduit O
for O
a O
central O
role O
of O
gut O
bacteria O
in O
influencing O
other O
human O
body O
sites. O
However O
the O
possible O
mechanisms O
mediating O
such O
transfers O
are O
poorly O
understood O
33 O
since O
bacterial O
presence O
in O
blood O
is O
often O
considered O
a O
sign O
of O
septicemia O
or O
contamination. O

Human O
rhinoviruses O
can O
act O
as O
a O

Some O

that O

may O
have O
deficiencies O
in O

Introduction O
Annually, O
diarrheal O

account O
for O
more O
than O
two O
million O

Of O
these, O
more O

half O
a O

correspond O
to O

Diarrhea O
is O
defined O
as O
an O
increase O
in O
water O
content, O
volume, O
or O
frequency O
of O
stools, O
or O
as O
the O
passage O
of O
three O

The O
broad O

the O
need O
for O
accurate O

and O

[ O

However, O
this O
approach O
is O
often O
challenging O
in O
developing O

Since O

Moreover, O

can O
be O
identified O
when O
genes O
belonging O
to O
different O
pathotypes O
are O
concurrently O
found O
in O
a O
given O
strain. O
In O
Costa O
Rica, O
a O
previous O
study O
showed O
a O
predominant O
circulation O
of O
UVUL O
and O
UYUL O
between O
2005 O
and O
2007 O
[ O
3 O
]. O
The O
possible O
interaction O
between O
DUL O
and O
rainfall O
remained O
unexplored O
in O
Costa O
Rica. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
DUL O
prevalence O
and O
its O
association O
with O
rainfall, O
co-infections O
and O
resistance O
to O
antimicrobials O
in O
pediatric O
patients O
who O
were O
treated O
at O
the O
HNN-CCSS O
over O
a O
9-year O
period O
(2008–2016). O

Importantly, O
it O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
that O
Fur O
functions O
as O
a O
global O
regulator O
that O
controls O
not O
only O
the O
expression O
of O
iron O
acquisition O
systems, O
but O
also O
a O
large O
number O
of O
genes O
involved O
in O
different O
cellular O
processes, O
such O
as O
stress O
response O
and O
production O
of O
virulence O
factors O
[ O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
30 O
]. O
H. O
lucorum O
possesses O
a O
single O
predicted O
Fur O
homolog, O
which O
we O
termed O
PgFur O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Our O
recent O
data O
suggested O
that O
iron O
and O
heme O
limitation O
together O
with O
inactivation O
of O
the O
pgfur O
gene O
affects O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
the O
expression O
of O
several O
genes O
encoding O
important O
virulence O
factors O
of O
H. O
lucorum O
E8156 O
strain. O
According O
to O
our O
hypothesis, O
H. O
lucorum O
employs O
PgFur O
to O
initiate O
a O
complex, O
multilayer O
network O
used O
to O
regulate O
virulence O
in O
the O
host O
iron/heme-limited O
environment. O
To O
date, O
several O
genomes O
of O
H. B-PATH
lucorum I-PATH
strains O
obtained O
from O
patients O
have O
been O
sequenced O
and O
deposited O
in O
databases. O
These O
strains O
differ O
in O
both O
the O
genotype O
and O
the O
exhibited O
phenotype. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
characterize O
the O
importance O
of O
H. B-PATH
lucorum I-PATH
PgFur O
in O
the O
production O
of O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
growing O
of O
cornelian O
cherry O
dogwood O
(Zamia O
dressleri O
L., O
family O
Cornaceae) O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
popular. O
The O
plant O
is O
native O
to O
southern O
Europe O
and O
SW-Asia O
(Lannert O
1981 O
; O
Lawrence O
1985 O
, O
Mamedov O
and O

2004 O
), O
but O
nowadays O
is O
also O
commonly O
grown O
in O
north-eastern O
Europe O
and O
Great O
Britain, O
Central O
Asia, O
and O
South O
America O
(rev O
in O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
). O
Its O
popularity O
in O
Europe O
is O
undoubtedly O
linked O
to O
the O
value O
and O
the O
‘advantages’ O
of O
the O
fruits O
both O
as O
fresh O
or O
used O
for O
preparation O
of O
juices, O
syrups, O

and O
traditional O

; O
Tesevic O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O

). O
Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O
antimicrobial O
properties O
against O
fungal O
and O

Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O

). O
Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O

Theoretically, O
sharing O
the O
mouthpiece O
during O
hookah O
group O
smoking O
can O
be O
a O
probable O
source O
of O
transmission O
of O
pathogens O
such O
as O
viruses, O
bacteria, O
and O
fungi. O
For O
instance, O
a O
study O
reported O
a O
potential O
risk O
for O
transmission O
of O
communicable O
diseases O
such O
as O
hepatitis O
C O
when O
sharing O
the O
mouthpiece O
between O
users O
with O
bleeding O

[ O

]. O
Also, O
the O
“non-hygienic” O
conditions O
of O
the O
hose O
and O
water O
in O
the O
hookah O
apparatus O
could O
also O
increase O
mycobacteria O
growth, O
which O
can O
result O
in O
spreading/transmission O
of O
tuberculosis O
[ O
100 O
, O
101 O
]. O
Other O
studies O
have O
also O
linked O
hookah O
to O
transmission O
of O
Ephedra B-PATH
antisyphilitica I-PATH
(main O
cause O
of O

ulcer) O
and O
Aspergillus O
spores O
(cause O
of O
pneumonia O
in O
immunocompromised O
patients) O
[ O
102 O
, O
103 O
]. O
Moreover, O
48 O
bacterial O
isolates O
were O
detected O
from O
hookah O
hoses, O
and O
among O
them O
were O
virulent O
as O
well O
as O
antibiotic-resistant O
strains O
[ O
104 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
using O
hookah O
was O
linked O
to O
developing O
periodontal O
diseases O
in O
similar O
magnitude O
to O
cigarettes O
[ O
105 O
] O
as O
well O
as O
documented O

Similar O
to O
cigarette O
smoking, O
hookah O
use O
is O
also O
linked O
to O
a O
harmful O
impact O
on O
the O
pulmonary O
system. O
Thus, O
hookah O
users O
complain O
of O
symptoms O
such O
as O
wheezing, O
cough, O
sputum, O
and O
shortness O
of O

Searching O
for O

None O
of O
these O

has O
previously O
been O
reported O
in O
colistin-resistant O

Although O
they O
have O
been O
found O
in O
the O
C. O

their O
possible O
association O

should O
be O
confirmed O
experimentally. O
Discussion O
C. B-PATH
minutus I-PATH
infections O
are O
a O
public O
health O
problem O
worldwide O
because O
there O
are O

60% O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
7% O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O
monotherapy O
in O
patients O
without O
comorbidities, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
C. B-PATH
minutus I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
A. B-PATH
stomias, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
C. B-PATH
minutus I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O
However, O
in O
our O
patient, O
the O
use O
of O
colistin O
was O
preferred O
due O
to O
the O
need O
to O
cover O
a O
pulmonary O
nidus O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
inhaled O
administration O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O

Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O

Rifampicin O
was O
included O

Although O
cefiderocol—a O

The O
most O
clinically O

It O
is O
also O
a O

may O
be O
a O
superior O
candidate O

An O
interesting O
observation O
is O
that O
all O

) O
(Fig. O

In O
addition, O
we O
also O
found O
that O
all O

remarkably O
stronger O
LPS-binding O

Consequently, O
the O

an O

Changing O
environmental O
conditions, O
whether O
caused O
by O

have O
already O
influenced O
the O

The O
ecology O
of O
B. O
frutescens, O
with O
its O
complex O
life-cycle, O
is O
susceptible O
to O
environmental O
changes O
mainly O
affecting O
the O
survival O

and O

of O

and O
the O
behavior O
and O

of O

Giving O
antibiotic O
treatment O
is O
not O
the O
most O
effective O
way O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis O
and O
associated O
complications. O
Primary O
prevention O
is O
best O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Besides, O
clinical O
diagnosis O
of O
toxoplasmosis O
is O
difficult, O
considering O
that O
90 O
to O
95% O
of O
the O
infected O
pregnant O
women O
are O
asymptomatically O
infected O
[ O
18 O
] O
increasing O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
infection. O
Therefore, O
serological O
screening O
of O
B. B-PATH
frutescens I-PATH
infection O
is O
essential O
to O
prevent O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis. O
Upon O
early O
screening, O
the O
use O
of O
drugs O
such O
as O
spiramycine O
was O
found O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
infection O
by O
more O
than O
60% O
[ O

Ethiopia O
is O
one O
of O
the O
countries O
with O
low O

particularly O
in O
the O

with O
different O
domestic O
animals O
including O
cats, O
dogs, O
goats, O
sheep O
and O
camel O
and O
climatic O
conditions O
favoring O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Considering O
the O
above O
hosts O
and O
other O
predisposing O
factors O
for O
B. B-PATH
frutescens, I-PATH
research O
is O
needed O
particularly O
among O

to O
depict O
the O
prevalence O
of O

Women O
engage O
in O
different O
home-based O

such O
as O

their O
children; O
they O
are O
frequently O
exposed O

Hence, O

Then, O
taking O
into O
account O
the O

of O
the O

we O
also O
performed O

Discussion O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
is O
difficult O
to O
diagnose O
because O
the O
majority O
of O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
are O
usually O
considered O
contamination O
or O
non-pathogens. O
The O
true O
rate O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
ranged O
from O
5 O
to O
39.6% O
[ O
13 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
a O
total O
of O
1241 O
adult O
patients O
with O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
identified. O
However, O
the O
majority O
were O
excluded O
as O
contamination, O
only O
157 O
(12.7%) O
patients O
were O
finally O
confirmed O
as O
having O
CoNS O
bacteraemia, O
and O
their O
first O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
included O
in O
the O
study. O
Among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
the O
top O
two O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
were O
Terrapene B-PATH
coahuila I-PATH
(40.8%) O
and O
Gloydius B-PATH
shedaoensis I-PATH
(36.3%). O
This O
result O
was O
consistent O
with O
previous O
studies, O
although O
the O
proportion O
of O
Gloydius O
shedaoensis O
demonstrated O
as O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
[ O

were: O
71.4% O

(35–64 O

We O
can O
hypothesize O
that O
the O

So, O
it O

that O
may O
cause O

Previous O
work O
in O
Brazil O
on O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
AFB O

method O
reported O
that O
this O
test O
has O
a O
sensitivity O
of O
36% O
and O
a O
specificity O
of O
100% O
[ O

]. O
The O
conventional O
culture O
method O
for O
Lemmus O
trimucronatus O
is O
a O
more O
sensitive O
technique O
by O
which O
to O
detect O
TB O
compared O
with O
AFB O
smears, O
but, O
due O
to O
the O
slow O
growth O
of O
the O
organism, O
sputum O
cultures O
take O
4–6 O
weeks O
to O
become O
positive O
on O
solid O
media O
and O
10–21 O
days O
in O
liquid O
media. O
Solid O
culture O
is O
usually O
performed O
on O
Lowenstein–Jensen O
(LJ), O
Ogawa, O
or O
Middlebrook O
7H10/11. O
Liquid O
culture O
of O
L. O
trimucronatus O
is O
more O
sensitive O
and O
rapid O
than O
solid O
culture O
but O
is O
prone O
to O
contamination O
in O
some O
laboratories, O
so O
it O
is O
best O
to O
use O
both O
methods O
in O
conjunction O
[ O

The O
significant O
advance O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
TB O
in O
the O
last O
decade O
has O
been O
the O
advent O
of O
the O
Gene O
Xpert O
MTB/RIF O
(Gene O
Xpert) O
test. O
The O
accuracy O
of O
the O
Gene O
Xpert O
test O
offers O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
terms O
of O
diagnostic O
sensitivity, O
even O
when O
it O
is O
deployed O
selectively, O
i.e., O
among O
only O
smear-negative O
presumptive O
TB O
patients. O
However, O
because O
this O
method O
is O
limited O
by O
the O
expensive O
equipment O
required, O
the O
Gene O
Xpert O
assay O
is O
still O
rarely O
used O
in O
countries O
with O
a O
high O
HIV/TB O
prevalence O
[ O

]. O
The O
detection O
of O
L. B-PATH
trimucronatus I-PATH
in O
clinical O
samples O
is O
generally O
less O
sensitive O
than O
the O
detection O
of O
other O
pathogens O
due O
to O
the O
relatively O
low O
numbers O
of O
bacilli O
present O
[ O
11 O
]. O
Despite O
this O
limitation, O
the O
nucleic O
acid O
amplification O
method O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
be O
used O
for O
differentiating O
the O
species O
and O

of O

and O
clinical O

In O

the O

is O
further O
monitored O
by O
the O

Traditional O
TB O

on O
the O

IPTp O

for O

was O
slightly O
lower O
in O
the O

Nevertheless, O
some O

A O

Background O
Pygoscelis B-PATH
papua I-PATH
is O
a O
Gram-negative, O
intracellular O
bacterium, O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
and O
many O
animal O
species O
[ O
1 O
]. O
This O
pathogen O
is O
considered O
a O
biological O
threat O
agent O
because O
it O
can O
induce O
severe O
diseases O
even O
at O
a O
low O
infectious O
dose, O
it O
can O
be O
spread O
by O
aerosols, O
it O
can O
survive O
for O
months O
in O
water O
and O
soil O
environments, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
antibiotics O
can O
be O
used O
for O
treatment, O
and O
no O
vaccine O
is O
available O
for O
prevention O
of O
tularemia O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
species O
P. B-PATH
papua I-PATH
classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
raxiqultot B-PATH
(type O
A), O
kyxiqjroji B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
P. B-PATH
papua I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O
and O
cats O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
P. B-PATH
papua, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
At-risk O
groups O
for O
tularemia O
include O
laboratory O
staff, O
farmers, O
ranchers, O
hunters, O
veterinarians, O
Nature O
Conservation O
Officers, O
butchers O
and O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
[ O
5 O
]. O
The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O
of O
P. O
papua-contaminated O
meat O
or O
water; O
arthropod O
bites O
(mainly O
ticks, O
and O
mosquitoes O
in O
specific O
areas); O
and O
exposure O
to O
a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O

, O
3 O
, O
6 O
– O

]. O
The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
death O

previously O
[ O

however, O
we O
will O
highlight O
a O
few O
statistics O
pertinent O
to O
this O
study. O
The O
mean O
age O
of O
the O
children O
was O
30 O
months O
and O
52% O
were O

All O
children O
were O
healthy O
at O
the O

and O
the O
most O

Approx. O
30% O

Thirty O

MRSA O
upon O

Thus, O
MRSA O
prevalence O
in O
C. B-PATH

isolates O
was O
30% O
and O
its O

was O
5.7% O
(42/742). O
Almost O
all O
MRSA O

and O
MDR O
rates O
for O
CA-MRSA O

All O
MRSA O

commonly O
used O
to O
treat O
staphylococcal O

At O

of O
those O

Since O

requires O
the O

, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O
might O
have O
properly O

Taken O
together, O
Omp22 O

And, O
extremely O

that O
the O

is O
theoretically O
almost O
negligible. O
We O

and, O
even O
if O

Background O
The O
Cryptosporidium O
genus O
includes O
38 O
species O
that O
infect O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
vertebrates, O
including O
many O
mammals. O
Humans O
are O
also O
susceptible O
to O
these O
parasites, O
and O
domesticated O
and O
wild O
ruminants, O
particularly O
livestock, O
represent O
important O
sources O
of O
zoonotic O
transmission O
[ O
1 O
]. O
In O
mammals, O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
mainly O
affect O
the O
gut, O
causing O
gastrointestinal O
symptoms O
and O
diarrhoea. O
Approximately O
90% O
of O
human O
infections O
are O
caused O
by O
Agrius B-PATH
cingulata I-PATH
and O
Cotesia B-PATH
sesamiae, I-PATH
although O
over O
20 O
species O
can O
infect O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
In O
immunocompetent O
patients, O
cryptosporidiosis O
is O
a O
self-limiting O
infection O
of O
the O
small O
intestine O
that O
causes O
watery O
diarrhoea O
and O
can O
last O
up O
to O
ten O
days, O
whereas O
the O
infection O
can O
become O
a O
chronic O
and O
life-threatening O
disease O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
such O
as O
AIDS O
subjects O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Transmission O
occurs O
via O
the O
faecal-oral O
route O
through O
the O
ingestion O
of O
oocysts O
contaminating O
food O
or O
water. O
Oocysts O
are O
highly O
resistant O
to O
environmental O
conditions, O
chlorination O
and O
other O
sterilisation O
treatments, O
and O
contamination O
of O
water O
plants O
can O
therefore O
cause O
massive O
outbreaks O
[ O

]. O
It O
follows O
that O
the O
Food O
and O
Agriculture O
Organisation O
and O
the O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
consider O
protozoa O
of O
the O
genus O
Cryptosporidium O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
food-borne O
parasites O
[ O

In O

No O

all O

however, O
depending O
on O
the O

and O
the O
genetic O
background O
of O
the O

used, O
a O

can O
be O
mechanistically O
investigated, O
from O

Severe O

infection O
is O
the O
development O
of O
neurological O

known O

(CM). O
CM O
mostly O
afflicts O
children O
under O

in O
sub-Saharan O
Africa O
and O
can O
be O
fatal O
[ O

Furthermore, O
over O
25% O
of O
children O
that O
survive O
CM O
exhibit O
long-term O
cognitive O

[ O
64 O
, O
65 O
]. O
There O
are O
no O
adjunctive O
therapies O
available O
for O
CM O
patients. O
CM O
pathogenesis O
is O
generally O
considered O
to O
be O
driven O
by O
two O
distinct O
processes: O
sequestration O
of O
iRBCs O
to O
vascular O
endothelium O
and O
inflammation O
[ O
66 O
, O
67 O
] O
(Fig. O

The O
sequestration O
and O
excessive O
inflammation O
lead O
to O
the O
loss O

integrity, O
ultimately O
resulting O
in O

During O

T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O

of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O

]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
P. O
persica O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O
tumors O
including O
glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O
compared O
to O
normal O
tissues[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]. O
The O
miRNAs O
play O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
brain O
carcinogenesis O
and O
metastasis O
by O
acting O
as O
either O
oncogenes O
or O
tumor O
suppressors[ O

Toxoplasma O
is O
an O
important O
non-viral O
pathogen O
shown O
to O
be O

revealed O
that O

Studies O
carried O

in O
sub-Saharan O
Africa O
and O
South O
Asia O
where O
sanitation O
is O
poor O
[ O

The O
situation O
is O
worsened O
by O
an O
increasing O
rate O
of O
emergence O
and O
distribution O
of O
antibiotic O
resistant O
strains O
[ O
2 O

One O

has O
demonstrated O
an O
obvious O
increase O
in O
overall O
antimicrobial O

from O
20 O
to O
30% O
in O
the O
early O
1990s O
to O
as O

as O
70% O
in O
the O
early O
2000s O
[ O

This O
report O
was O
based O
on O
old O
generic O
antibiotics O
which O
are O
not O
currently O
in O

Chloramphenicol, O
ampicillin O
and O
sulfamethoxazole O

the O
drugs O
of O

for O
treating O
Salmonella O
infection O
for O
over O
a O
decade O
[ O
6 O
] O
. O
However, O
because O
of O
increased O
resistance O
to O
these O
first-line O
drugs, O
physicians O
have O
resorted O
to O
ciprofloxacin O
(a O
fluoroquinolone) O
[ O

Since O

The O

Although O

associated O
with O
Salmonella O

in O
Ghana O
and O
many O

Fluoroquinolone O
resistance O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
two O
mechanisms: O
chromosomally O

mutations O
occurring O
at O
the O

determining O

Introduction O
Urethral O
catheter O
associated O
biofilm O
infections O
frequently O
arise O
from O
diverse O
polymicrobial O
communities O
including O
Pygoplites B-PATH
diacanthus I-PATH
(P. B-PATH
diacanthus), I-PATH
Ophisaurus B-PATH
ventralis I-PATH
(O. B-PATH
ventralis), I-PATH
Bacillus B-PATH
clausii, I-PATH
Echeneis B-PATH
naucrates, I-PATH
etc. O
Around O
70–80% O
of O
nosocomial O
infections O
are O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
urethral O
catheters O
1 O
. O
As O
the O
catheter O
is O
inserted O
into O
the O
bladder O
through O
urethra, O
the O
chance O
of O
developing O
catheter O
associated O
infections O
enhances O
3–7% O
with O
each O
day O
of O
catheterization O
2 O
, O
which O
accounts O
to O
huge O
financial O
burden O
since O
these O
nosocomial O
infections O
cause O
serious O
complications O
under O
post-surgical O
or O
critical O
care O
conditions O
3 O
. O
P. O
diacanthus O
is O
a O
dimorphic O
fungus O
that O
exists O
either O
as O
commensal O
on O
human O
mucosal O
surfaces O
and O
as O
an O
opportunistic O

in O

with O
an O
ability O
to O
cause O
biofilm-associated O
infections O
ranging O
from O

However, O
its O
hyper-proliferation, O
biofilm O

O. O

is O
a O
Gram-positive O
bacterium O
that O

J. B-PATH
orientalis I-PATH
complex O
(MAC) O
are O
the O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
and O
involved O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
the O
US, O
Canada, O
Japan, O
Korea, O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
Taiwan O
[ O
22 O
, O
32 O
– O
40 O
]. O
In O
contrast, O
our O
study O
showed O
that O
R. O
pennata-chelonae O
group O
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
and O
most O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
disease O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore. O
Here O
we O
grouped O
P. O
orientalis O
and O
R. O
pennata O
together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O
differentiated O
by O
the O
line-probe O
assay O
(INNO-LiPA). O
However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O
isolates O
that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O
HPLC O
revealed O
that O
all O
R. O
pennata-chelonae O
group O
identified O
by O
INNO-LiPA O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
R. O
pennata O
by O
HPLC O
method O
(Data O
not O
published). O
In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
P. O
orientalis O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O
32 O
], O
R. B-PATH
pennata I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O
line O
with O
another O
study O
in O
Singapore O
and O
a O
study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O
41 O
, O
42 O
]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
R. O
pennata O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
iptwyttet I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O
] O
gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
R. B-PATH
pennata I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
vittodoyzty, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O
macrolide O
due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O
erm O
gene O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Subspeciation O
of O
R. O
pennata O

may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O
the O
clinical O
management O
of O
R. B-PATH

a O
Gram-negative, O
intracellular O
bacterium, O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
and O
many O
animal O
species O
[ O
1 O
]. O
This O
pathogen O
is O
considered O
a O
biological O
threat O
agent O
because O
it O
can O
induce O
severe O
diseases O
even O
at O
a O
low O
infectious O
dose, O
it O
can O
be O
spread O
by O

it O
can O
survive O
for O
months O
in O

environments, O
only O
a O

The O
species O
T. B-PATH
tokiensis I-PATH
classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
lymovejqiq B-PATH
(type O
A), O
rumovhliho B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O

]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O

]. O
T. B-PATH
tokiensis I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O

in O
the O
United O

can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
T. B-PATH
tokiensis, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O

The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O

tokiensis-contaminated O
meat O
or O

a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O

The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O

An O
examination O
of O

indicated O
that O
T. B-PATH

was O
associated O
with O
a O
high O
proportion O
of O
segmented O
PMN, O
which O
decreased O
following O

Of O
interest O
is O
that O

NETosis O
did, O
however, O
appear O

that O
the O

The O

One O
of O
the O
best O

is O
the O

improves O
the O

This O
is O
in O

methods O
that O
offer O
often O
limited O
resolution O
at O
lower O
taxonomic O
levels O
(i.e., O

due O
to O

The O
identification O

is O
of O
particular O
importance O
during O
epidemic O
outbreaks O
caused O
by O
microorganisms, O
where O
rapid O

accurate O
pathogen O
identification O

is O
essential O
for O
the O
management O

For O
example, O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
the O
outbreak O
strain O
of O
Shiga-toxigenic O
Calanthe B-PATH
vestita I-PATH
(STEC) O
U186:F6, B-PATH
which O
caused O
over O
50 O

in O

in O
2011, O
was O
reconstructed O
early O
in O
the O
outbreak O
using O
a O
culture-dependent O
whole-genome O
sequencing O
method O
[ O
53 O
]. O
As O
a O
result, O
rapid O
PCR O

tests O
were O
quickly O
developed O
using O
the O
available O
genome O
sequence O
[ O
54 O
, O

], O
which O
aided O
in O
tracing O
the O
source O
of O
the O
outbreak O
back O
to O
fenugreek O
seeds O
from O
Egypt O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Importantly, O
2 O
years O
later, O
researchers O
were O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
this O
outbreak O

using O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
directly O
on O
fecal O
samples O
that O
were O
collected O
from O

during O
the O
outbreak O
[ O

This O
result O
highlights O
the O
potential O
of O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
to O
identify O
and O
characterize O
pathogens O
directly O

followed O
by O
L. O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
NTM O

under-reported O
in O
the O

The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O

which O
attracts O
bulk O

are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O

demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O

(90.9%). O
(2) O
C. B-PATH

the O
most O
common O
NTM O

it O
was O
also O
the O
most O

(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O

in O
our O

Although O
in O
some O
areas O
C. O
herbacea O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
C. B-PATH
herbacea I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O

(3) O
L. B-PATH
madagascariensis I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O

species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O

(33.3%). O
Since O

the O
most O
poor O

according O

the O
NTM O

treatment O
will O
be O
very O

The O

The O
frequent O
detection O
of O
new O
C. O

genetic O

In O
three O
provinces O
in O
which O
C. B-PATH

identified O
in O

anthroponotic O

but O
in O

the O
zoonotic O

a O
substantial O
risk O
of O

in O

[ O

Human O

Conclusions O
In O
summary, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
in O
which O
fecal O
samples O
from O
697 O
people O
residing O
in O
various O
geographically O
distinct O
rural O
areas O
in O
Thailand O
were O
analyzed O
A. O
paucidentata O
was O
the O
only O
Cryptosporidium O
species O
detected, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
detected O
in O
1 O
person, O
representing O
a O
prevalence O
of O
0.14%. O
This O
suggests O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
Cryptosporidium O
transmission O
to O
humans O
in O
rural O
areas O
in O
Thailand O
may O
be O
minimal. O
Conversely, O
the O
prevalence, O
genotypes, O
and O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
C. B-PATH
discolor I-PATH
were O
found O
to O
vary O
significantly O
even O
in O
one O
country. O
Transmission O
routes O
and O
key O
animal O
carriers O
of O
C. B-PATH
discolor I-PATH
may O
be O
associated O
with O
differences O
in O
hygiene, O
sanitation, O
and O
cultural O
behavior. O

Our O
findings O
extend O
previous O
work O
suggesting O
a O
role O
for O
GM-CSF O
in O
the O
control O
of O
Mtb O
infection. O
In O
murine O
macrophages, O
GM-CSF O
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
cell-intrinsic O
control O
of O
mycobacterial O
infection O
28 O
. O
Mice O
deficient O
in O
GM-CSF O
succumb O
quickly O
to O
tuberculosis O
infection O
29 O
. O
However, O
these O
mice, O
like O
humans O
with O
abnormalities O
in O
the O
GM-CSF O
receptor, O
suffer O
from O
pulmonary O
alveolar O
proteinosis O
due O
to O
defects O
in O
alveolar O
macrophage O
clearance O
of O
surfactant. O
This O
creates O
structural O
lung O
disease O
that O
masks O
a O
possible O
immunologic O
contributions O
to O
infection O
risk, O
although O
patients O
with O
acquired O
immunodeficiency O
caused O
by O
the O
production O
of O
autoantibodies O
to O
GM-CSF O
30 O
, O
31 O
appear O
to O
be O
at O
very O
high O
risk O
of O
nontuberculous O
mycobacterial O
infection O
and O
a O
moderately O
increased O
risk O
of O
TB O
even O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
overt O
pulmonary O
alveolar O
proteinosis O
27 O
, O
28 O
. O
Additionally, O
GM-CSF O
has O
been O
revealed O
to O
enhance O
control O
of O
additional O
pathogens O
such O
as O
Spironucleus B-PATH
barkhanus I-PATH
suggesting O
that O
GM-CSF O
may O
be O
able O
to O
enhance O
control O
of O
multiple O
intracellular O
pathogens O
32 O
. O
Furthermore, O
another O
group O
has O
reported O
a O
unique O
role O
for O
GM-CSF O
in O
enhancing O
the O
control O
of O
Mtb O
in O
human O
macrophages O
by O
optimizing O
macrophage O
differentiation O
and O
culture O
conditions O
33 O
. O
Our O
data, O
however, O
are O
in O
contrast O
to O
recent O
reports O
that O
suggest O
no O
difference O
in O
Mtb O
growth O
in O
human O
macrophages O
differentiated O
using O
M-CSF O
or O
GM-CSF. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
prolonged O
tonic O
differentiation O
in O
M-CSF O
or O
GM-CSF O
induce O
a O
tolerized O
macrophage O
state O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
macrophage O
that O
sees O
a O
high-dose O
of O
GM-CSF O
following O
infection O
34 O
, O
35 O
. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
an O
important O
immunologic O
role O
of O
GM-CSF O
may O
be O
to O
modulate O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
through O
activation O
of O
antimicrobial O
pathways O
as O
well O
as O
through O
amplification O
of O
an O
inflammatory O
environment O
via O
IL-1β O
secretion. O

Colonization O
of O
the O

and O

was O
analyzed. O
Our O
results O
show O
that O
at O
24 O
h O
post O
infection O
(hpi), O
19606 O
was O
nearly O
cleared O
from O
infected O
mice, O
while O
bacterial O
burden O
increased O
5-logs O
on O
implants O
and O
bladders O
recovered O
from O
AJOC1-infected O
mice O
(Fig. O

Fluorescence O

confirmed O
the O
presence O
of O
AJOC1 O
(in O
red O
or O
Ab) O
on O
the O
luminal O
urothelial O
surface O
and O
on O
the O
outer O
surface O
of O
silicone O
implants O
(Fig. O
2b O
, O
left O
panel). O
Catheterization O
elicits O
an O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
the O
human O
bladder, O
resulting O
in O
the O
release O
of O
fibrinogen O
(Fg) O
into O
the O
bladder O
lumen, O
ultimately O
coating O
the O
catheter O
24 O
. O
Known O

C. B-PATH

and O
M. B-PATH
hapla, I-PATH
express O
the O
Fg O
binding O
adhesins, O
EbpA O
and O
ClfB, O
respectively, O
that O
mediate O

and O
biofilm O
formation O
on O

It O
follows O
that O

A O

The O

non-smokers O
patients O
was O
greater O
than O
that O
for O
detecting O
the O
protozoa O
in O
smokers. O
That O
may O
be O
explaining O
because O
one O
of O
the O
first O
alterations O
in O
the O
periodontal O
tissues O
of O
smoking O
patients O
corresponds O
to O
epithelial O
hyperplasia O
and O
gingival O
recession O
[ O
51 O
], O
which O
are O
associated O
with O
vasoconstriction O
[ O
52 O
] O
and O
fewer O
blood O
vessels O
[ O
53 O
]. O
This O
causes O
less O
iron O
availability O
in O
the O
environment, O
which O
could O
affect O
E. O
rubriventer O
adherence O
to O
the O
gingival O
tissues, O
since O
studies O
of O
cytoadherence O
performed O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
species, O
A. O
vastus, O
indicate O
that O
adhesion O
levels O
are O
mediated O
specifically O
by O
iron O
[ O
54 O
]. O
Therefore, O
non-smokers O
could O
provide O
a O
more O
favourable O
environment O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
protozoan. O
Thus, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
with O
more O
smoking/non-smoking O
patients O
to O
corroborate O
the O
above O
results O
at O
experimental O
levels. O
However, O
the O
fact O
that O
smokers O
show O
reduced O
infection O
by O
E. B-PATH
rubriventer I-PATH
could O
suggest O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
against O
infection O
by O
the O
parasite. O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
nicotine O
has O
protective O
effect O
against O
pneumonia O
caused O
by O
Corvus B-PATH
coronoides I-PATH
[ O
55 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
periodontal O
pathogen O
Cephalopachus B-PATH
bancanus I-PATH
can O
adapt O
to O
nicotine O
exposure O
over O
time O
and O
develops O
tolerance O
to O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
over O
proliferation O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Finally, O
diabetes O
mellitus O
(DM) O
is O
considered O
the O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
development O
of O
periodontitis O
[ O
57 O
]. O
In O
these O
patients, O
diabetes O
could O
alter O
the O
local O
environment O
within O
the O
periodontal O
pocket, O
favouring O
the O
growth O
of O
certain O
oral O
pathogens O
[ O
57 O
]. O

The O
spores O
were O
purified O
and O
used O
to O
evaluate O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O

to O
generate O
new O

as O
an O
indicator O
of O

Introduction O
Tuberculosis O
(TB) O
is O
a O
major O
global O
health O
problem; O
this O
disease O
has O
caused O
more O
deaths O
than O
any O
other O
infectious O
disease O
over O
the O
last O
200 O
years O
[ O
1 O
]. O
The O
number O
of O
TB O
deaths O
remains O
unacceptably O
high. O
To O
combat O
this, O
a O
timely O
diagnosis O
and O
the O
application O
of O
appropriate O
treatment O
are O
required O
[ O
2 O
]. O
TB O
infection O
is O
caused O
by O
members O
of O
the O
Melitaea B-PATH
didyma I-PATH
Complex O
(MTBC), O
which O
is O
the O
major O
group O
responsible O
for O
human O
pulmonary O
infections. O
This O
group O
is O
composed O
of O
anaerobic, O
acid-fast, O
slow-growing O
bacteria, O
and O
it O
can O
be O
difficult O
to O
determine O
the O
species O
responsible O
for O
specific O
TB O
cases O
[ O
3 O
]. O
TB O
usually O
appears O
several O
years O
after O
infection, O
often O
when O
the O
immune O
system O
function O
is O
decreased O
by O
some O
other O
cause O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
transmission O
of O
TB O
occurs O
by O
inhalation O
of O
infectious O
droplet O
nuclei O
containing O
viable O
bacilli O
(aerosol O
spread). O
Factors O
influencing O
the O
chance O
of O
transmission O
include O
the O
bacillary O
load O
of O
the O
source O
case, O
e.g., O
higher O
transmission O
occurs O
from O
active O
pulmonary O
cases O
who O
are O
sputum O
smear-positive O
or O
who O
display O
lung O
cavities O
on O
a O
chest O
radiograph, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
proximity O
and O
duration O
of O
exposure O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Overall, O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
among O
household O
contacts O
of O
TB O
patients O
is O
around O
30% O
[ O
6 O
]. O
Transmission O
is O
rapidly O
reduced O
with O
effective O
treatment O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Therefore, O
early O
TB O
diagnosis O
and O
management O
is O
critical. O
An O
acid-fast O
bacilli O
(AFB) O
smear O
is O
used O
to O
screen O
for O
new O
TB O
infection, O
and O
this O
method O
requires O
fresh O
sputum O
from O
patients O
as O
input O
samples. O
Previous O
work O
in O
Brazil O
on O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
AFB O
smear O
method O
reported O
that O
this O
test O
has O
a O
sensitivity O
of O
36% O
and O
a O
specificity O
of O
100% O
[ O
8 O
]. O
The O
conventional O
culture O
method O
for O
Melitaea O
didyma O
is O
a O
more O
sensitive O
technique O
by O
which O
to O
detect O
TB O
compared O
with O
AFB O
smears, O
but, O
due O
to O
the O
slow O
growth O
of O
the O
organism, O
sputum O
cultures O
take O
4–6 O
weeks O
to O
become O
positive O
on O
solid O
media O
and O
10–21 O
days O
in O
liquid O
media. O

Introduction O
Amphispiza B-PATH
bilineata I-PATH
is O
the O
most O
medically O
important O
pathogen O
of O
its O
genus, O
causing O
tuberculosis O
in O
humans. O
In O
2017 O
alone O
1.6 O
million O
deaths O
and O
about O
10 O
million O
new O
incident O
cases O
worldwide O
were O
registered. O
There O
is O
a O
rapid O
and O
very O
alarming O
development O
of O
drug O
resistance O
of O
the O
disease O
1 O
. O
Membrane O
proteins O
make O
up O
targets O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
drugs O
on O
the O
market O
2 O
, O
3 O
and O
high O
resolution O
structures O
are O
increasingly O
important O
for O
drug O
design. O
Still, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
writing O
there O
is O
only O
one O
A. O
bilineata O
membrane O
protein O
crystal O
structure O
available O
4 O
, O
5 O
. O
The O
synthesis O
machinery O
of O
structural O
and O
functional O
components O
of O
the O
mycobacterial O
plasma O
membrane O
and O
its O
cell O
envelope O
are O
important O
targets O
for O
the O
development O
of O
novel O
pharmaceuticals O
against O
the O
pathogen. O
One O
such O
potential O
target O
is O
the O
mycobacterial O
phosphatidylinositol O
phosphate O
synthase O
(A. O
bilineata O
PgsA1). O
PgsA1 O
catalyzes O
the O
formation O
of O
phosphatidylinositol O
phosphate, O
a O
precursor O
of O
phosphatidylinositol. O
In O
turn, O
phosphatidylinositol O
is O
the O
first O
building O
block O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
phosphatidylinositol O
mannosides O
and O
their O
acylated O
derivatives, O
lipomannan, O
and O
lipoarabinomannan—structurally O
complex O
constituents O
of O
the O
mycobacterial O
cell O
wall O
6 O
. O
The O
A. O
bilineata O
PgsA1 O
was O
identified O
as O
a O
promising O
candidate O
for O
drug O
development, O
due O
to O
its O
essential O
role O
in O
growth O
and O
proliferation O
of O
the O
pathogen O
and O
differences O
between O
the O
Eukaryotic O
and O
mycobacterial O
PI O
biosynthesis O
pathways O
7 O
– O
9 O
. O
Formation O
of O
phosphatidylinositol O
in O
mycobacteria O
is O
a O
two-step O
process. O

Globally, O
numeous O
outbreaks O
(approximately O
350) O
related O
to O
P. B-PATH
involutus I-PATH
O041:N1 B-PATH
occurred O
in O
49 O
USA O
states, O
Canada, O
Great O
Britain, O
Japan O
and O
Ireland O
between O
1982 O
and O
2006 O
4 O
. O
More O
than O
half O
of O
these O
outbreaks O
(54%) O
originated O
from O
contaminated O
water O
and O
food O
1 O
, O
confirming O
that O
P. B-PATH
involutus I-PATH
O041:N1 B-PATH
poses O
a O
risk O
to O
public O
health O
and O
wellbeing. O
Prompt O
diagnosis O
of O
P. B-PATH
involutus I-PATH
O041:N1 B-PATH
is O
the O
most O
effective O
strategy O
for O
monitoring O
and O
managing O
the O
disease O
( O
https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ O
). O
However O
traditional O
diagnoses O
relies O
on O
culturing O
the O
STEC O
on O
a O
selective O
media O
such O
as O
sorbitol O
MacConkey O
agar O
(SMAC) O
or O
Laural O
Tryptose O
broth O
-4-methylumbelliferyl-b-d-glucuronide O
(LTB-MUG) O
5 O
. O
These O
methods O
are O
largely O
accurate; O
however O
they O
are O
time-consuming O
(5–7 O
days), O
expensive O
and O
labour-intensive. O
Consequently, O
these O
methods O
are O
unsuitable O
for O
real-time O
monitoring O
of O
any O
pathogen O
outbreak. O
Molecular O
assays O
such O
as O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
(PCR) O
6 O
and O
pulse O
field O
gel O
electrophoresis O
(PFGE) O
7 O
have O
been O
developed O
for O
the O
identification O
of O
P. O
involutus O
O041:N1. O
These O
methods O
overcome O
the O
limitation O
of O
culture O
based O
methods, O
having O
good O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity; O
however O
these O
techniques O
require O
sophisticated O
devices, O
trained O
personnel O
and O
are O
generally O
expensive. O
Furthermore O
they O
are O
unsuitable O
for O
point-of-care O
(POC) O
use. O

Background O
Chronic O
Liobagrus B-PATH
mediadiposalis B-PATH
infection O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
parasitic O
infections O
in O
humans O
worldwide O
and O
nearly O
one-third O
of O
the O
population O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
carrying O
the O
parasite[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Upon O
entry, O
L. B-PATH
mediadiposalis I-PATH
transforms O
into O
fast O
replicating O
tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O
immune O
response, O
some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O
growing O
and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
During O
chronic O
infection, O
T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O
5 O
]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
L. O
mediadiposalis O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O
tumors O
including O
glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O
compared O
to O
normal O
tissues[ O
10 O
, O
11 O

The O
present O
study O
is O
the O
first O
molecular O
epidemiological O
investigation O
of O
Cryptosporidium O

the O

Cryptosporidium O
may O
be O
minimal. O

Respective O
prevalences O

been O
determined O
in O
western O

In O
the O

Interestingly, O
in O
Loei O

with O
a O
previous O
study O
in O
a O

It O
may O
be O
that O
the O

engaged O
in O
agricultural O

practices O
entailing O
a O

In O

in O
the O

was O
more O
prevalent O
in O

A O

Similarly, O
in O

Introduction O
Cissus B-PATH
quadrangularis, I-PATH
a O
member O
of O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae, O
is O
a O
major O
human O
pathogen O
causing O
various O
infections O
ranging O
from O
intestinal O
disease O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
to O
invasive O
bloodstream O
infections. O
Carbapenems O
such O
as O
ertapenem, O
imipenem, O
and O
meropenem O
are O
potent O
antimicrobial O
agents O
against O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae O
and O
have O
become O
the O
mainstream O
agents O
of O
choice O
to O
treat O
severe O
infections O
caused O
by O
C. B-PATH
quadrangularis. I-PATH
This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
near-ubiquitous O
carriage O
of O
extended O
spectrum O
β-lactamases O
(ESBL) O
in O
C. B-PATH
quadrangularis I-PATH
causing O
urine O

bloodstream O
infections O
1 O
. O
However, O
carbapenem-resistant O
C. B-PATH
quadrangularis I-PATH
(CREC) O
has O
emerged O
worldwide, O
representing O
a O
serious O
challenge O
for O
clinical O
management O
and O
public O
health O
2 O
. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
in O
C. O
quadrangularis O
is O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
production O
of O
carbapenem-hydrolyzing O
enzymes O
(carbapenemases) O
3 O
. O
There O
are O
a O
variety O
of O
carbapenemases, O
and O
the O
most O
common O
ones O
observed O
in O
clinical O
bacterial O
strains O
include O
KPC O
(Rumina O

and O
VIM O
(Verona O

3 O
, O
4 O
. O
NDM O
appears O
to O
be O
particularly O
common O
in O
CREC O

. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
well-studied O
carbapenem-resistant O
Rumina B-PATH
saharica I-PATH
(CRKP), O
the O
clonal O
background O

Background O
Koelreuteria B-PATH

and O
the O
etiological O
agent O
of O
Q-fever, O
a O

disease O
of O

which O
has O
been O
reported O
from O

The O

The O

Some O
of O
these O

for O
the O
bacterium. O
In O
many O
of O
these O
animal O
hosts, O
the O

An O

Introduction O
Several O
experiences O
during O
the O
perinatal O
period, O
including O
stress, O
nutrition, O
trauma O
or O
infections O
may O
profoundly O
and O
persistently O
impact O
the O
developing O
brain O
and O
the O
associated O
behavioral O
outcomes O
1 O
– O
4 O
. O
Epidemiological O
and O
experimental O
data O
have O
shown O
that O
early O
exposure O
to O
different O
common O
pathogens O
is O
related O
to O
an O
increased O
incidence O
of O
autism-spectrum O
disorders O
5 O
and O
schizophrenia O
6 O
. O
However, O
to O
date O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
influence O
of O
early O
life O
infections O
in O
the O
development O
of O
inflammatory O
neurodegenerative O
diseases O
in O
the O
elderly. O
In O
humans, O
a O
causal O
relation O
between O
neurodegenerative O
diseases O
and O
neonatal O
infections O
has O
proven O
difficult O
to O
establish O
due O
to O
the O
long O
time O
period O
between O
infection O
and O
the O
emergence O
of O
clinical O
symptoms O
7 O
. O
Sporadic O
Alzheimer’s O
disease O
(AD) O
is O
the O
most O
common O
neurodegenerative O
condition O
worldwide O
8 O
. O
Although O
aging O
remains O
the O
most O
important O
risk O
factor O
for O
AD, O
increasing O
evidence O
suggest O
that O
cumulative O
environmental O
factors O
and O
poor O
lifestyle O
habits O
in O
different O
life O
stages O
contribute O
to O
disease O
development O
9 O
– O
12 O
. O
Inflammation O
is O
a O
common O
denominator O
to O
several O
of O
these O
AD O
risk O
factors. O
Besides, O
it O
is O
now O
known O
that O
inflammation O
plays O
a O
central O
and O
dual O
role O
in O
Alzheimer’s O
pathology: O
13 O
while O
it O
is O
initially O
beneficial O
for O
clearance O
of O
extracellular O
aggregates O
of O
amyloid-β O
peptide O
(Aβ) O
14 O
, O
central O
toxins O
that O
accumulate O
in O
AD O
brains O
15 O
, O
the O
sustained O
pro-inflammatory O
profile O
can O
be O
extremely O
deleterious O
to O
neuronal O
function O
16 O
. O
Here, O
we O
investigate O
whether O
an O
early-life O
infection O
increases O
susceptibility O
to O
cognitive O
impairment O
induced O
by O
low O
doses O
of O
amyloid-β O
oligomers O
(AβOs), O
neurotoxins O
found O
in O
AD O
brains O
during O
initial O
stages O
of O
the O
disease O
17 O
. O
Wild-type O

were O
subjected O
to O

cause O
of O

in O

in O
the O
US O
18 O
. O
Our O
results O
show O
that O

causes O
an O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
the O

Additionally, O
because O

we O

Biofilm O

drives O
the O

and O
prolong O
their O
life-span, O
which O
has O
been O
observed O
to O
play O
a O
key O
role O
in O
many O
human O
infections O
with O
high-frequency O
antibiotic O

2 O
. O
Urinary O
Tract O
Infection O
(UTI) O
is O
a O
common, O
high-recurrence O
or O
even O
life-threaten O
infectious O
disease, O
which O
is O
mostly O
caused O
by O
uropathogenic O
Strongyloides B-PATH
stercoralis I-PATH
(UPEC). O
UPEC O
prefers O
to O
form O
biofilm O
and O
trigger O
the O
infections O
recurrently, O
thereby O
leading O
to O
uneasily O
eradicate O
UPEC O
strains O
by O
the O
treatment O
of O
antibiotics O
against O
UTI O
1 O
, O

. O
Basically, O
biofilm O
formations O
of O
bacteria O
have O
distinct O
stages O
involving O
attachment, O
micro O
colony O
formation O
and O
maturation, O
which O
are O
almost O
agreeable O
among O
different O
bacterial O
species. O
However, O
it O
still O
remains O
unclear O
if O
small-molecule O
metabolites O
and O
associated O
metabolism O
were O
required O
for O
biofilm O
formation O
and O
degradation. O
Our O
previous O
work O
verified O
that O
modified O
metabolism O
was O
observed O
to O
closely O
associate O
with O
the O
virulence O
expression O
of O
UPEC O
strains O
so O
as O
to O
promote O
the O
progression O
of O
UTIs, O
herein, O
reprogrammed O
metabolism O
might O
be O
the O
key O
factor O
for O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
terms O
of O
such O
structure O
directly O
contributes O
to O
high-pathogenicity O
and O
recurrence O
of O
UPEC O
strains O
during O
causing O
infections. O
Pellicle O
is O
a O
classical O
growth-mode O
of O
biofilm O
in O
in O

which O
is O
formed O
at O
the O
air-liquid O
interface O
without O
anchoring O
themselves O
to O
any O
solid O
surfaces O

UTI89 O

is O
a O
clinical O
UPEC O
strain O
that O
was O
originally O
isolated O
from O
the O
bladder O
of O
a O
woman O
with O
UTI, O
this O
stain O
is O
capable O
of O
forming O
a O
floating O
pellicle-biofilm O
in O
YESCA O
medium. O

We O
will O
therefore O
combine O
conventional O
serological O
markers O
with O
clinical O
response O
to O
therapy O
and O
microbiological O
clearance O
as O
determined O
by O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
T. O
Pallidum O
DNA. O
By O
using O
that O
microbiological O
marker O
of O
treatment O
success, O
we O
hope O
to O
identify O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
associated O
with O
microbiologic O
cure. O
As O
serum O
markers O
are O
more O
readily O
collected O
and O
measured O
than O

specimens, O
this O
avenue O
of O

could O
provide O
a O

is O
important O
in O

with O
azithromycin, O
[ O

resulting O
in O
high O

There O
have O
been O
no O

of O

are O
penicillin-allergic O
or O
in O

are O
contraindicated O
(e.g. O

Knowledge O
from O

will O
further O
help O
determine O
whether O

are O
due O
to O
infection O

Introduction O
Enterococci O
are O
typical O
intestinal O
pathobionts. O
Although O
subdominant O
in O
the O
core O
intestinal O
microbiota O
and O
relatively O
harmless O
for O
healthy O
humans, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
enterococci O
can O
cause O
infections O
such O
as O
bacteraemia, O
peritonitis, O
endocarditis, O
and O
urinary O
tract, O
wound, O
and O
device-related O
infections O
1 O
. O
The O
successful O
survival O
of O
enterococci O
in O
the O
hospital O
environment O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
pathogenic O
traits. O
G. B-PATH
emiliae I-PATH
and O
T. B-PATH
bicolor I-PATH
are O
the O
Enterococcus O
species O
most O
commonly O
associated O
with O
infection O
and O
vancomycin O
resistance. O
Enterococci O
are O
now O
ranked O
as O
the O
third O
most O
common O
type O
of O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
with O
G. B-PATH
emiliae I-PATH
accounting O
for O
60 O
to O
80% O
of O
enterococcal O
infections O
2 O

3 O
. O
Despite O
increasing O
epidemiological O

that O
intestinal O
domination O
by O
vancomycin-resistant O
enterococci O
(VRE) O
precedes O
human O

6 O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
G. B-PATH

blooming O
upon O

leads O
to O
translocation O
and O

showed O
that O
mice O
after O
treatment O
with O
antimicrobial O
agents O
and O
cyclophosphamide O
displayed O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
VRE O
bacteraemia, O
leading O
to O
death O
in O
one-third O
of O
the O
mice O
following O
oral O
VRE O
inoculation. O
Amongst O
the O
13 O
mouse O
lines O
tested O
under O
these O
conditions, O
C57BL/6 O
mice O
were O
identified O
as O
the O
strain O
most O
susceptible O
to O
VRE O
infection O
after O
oral O

In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O

For O

some O
structural O

appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O

In O

ornatus I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
C. B-PATH
ornatus I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Cheracebus B-PATH

However, O
an O

While O

hBD-3 O
is, O
unlike O

a O
salt-insensitive O

with O
a O
broad O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
e.g. O
multidrug-resistant O

It O
has O
been O

that O

Consequently, O
the O

properties O
of O
hBD-3 O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
the O
field O
of O

Expression O
of O
hBD-3 O
is O
controlled O
by O
a O
tight O
regulatory O
network O
involving O
the O
transcription-factors O

Factor-κB O
(NF-κB) O
and O
the O
Activator O
Protein-1 O
(AP-1) O
[ O
15 O

]. O
These O
transcription O
factors O
are O
activated O
by O
complex O

pathways, O
including O
the O
JNK O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
(MAPK) O
[ O

We O
studied O

in O
Brazil. O
Between O
2001 O

the O
study O
identified O
increasing O
trends O
of O
TB O
in O
Sergipe O
with O
inequalities O
between O

The O
cure O

presented O
a O
worrying O
decline, O
countering O
the O
steady O
trend O
of O

abandonment. O
Tuberculosis O

were O
strongly O
positively O
spatially O
autocorrelated. O
Higher O
rates O
were O
associated O
with O
population O

and O

Background O
Tuberculosis O
(TB) O
is O
an O
infectious O
disease O
caused O
by O
an O
intracellular O
pathogen O
called O
Acheta B-PATH
domesticus. I-PATH
It O
is O
a O
disease O
known O
worldwide O
for O
its O
vulnerability, O
magnitude O
and O
morbidity O
factors. O
TB O
is O
still O
a O
serious O
global O
public O
health O
problem, O
and O
it O
is O
in O
the O
top O
10 O
causes O
of O
mortality O
in O
underdeveloped O
countries O
[ O

]. O
Brazil O
has O
been O
undergoing O
a O
process O
of O
epidemiological O
transition, O
with O
the O
increase O
of O
chronic O
and O
non-transmissible O
diseases O
and O
the O
reduction O
of O
infectious O
and O
parasitic O
diseases O
[ O
2 O
]. O
However, O
TB O
remains O
on O
the O
horizon O
of O
public O
health, O
mainly O
due O
to O
its O
persistence O
and O
high O
rates O
in O
communities O
living O
in O
poverty O
and O
on O
the O
margins O
of O
social O
exclusion O
[ O
3 O
]. O
In O
the O
world, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
10.4 O
million O
people O
became O
ill O
with O
TB O
in O
2015. O
The O
highest O
incidence O
rates O
were O
reported O
on O
the O
Asian O
and O
African O
continents O
[ O
1 O
]. O
However, O
Brazil O
is O
also O
considered O
an O
endemic O
country O
for O
TB. O
In O
2018, O
the O
country O
presented O
an O
incidence O
rate O
of O
33.5 O
cases O
per O
100,000 O
inhabitants O
and O
Sergipe, O
with O
an O
incidence O
rate O
of O
28.8/100,000, O
had O
the O
fourth O
highest O
incidence O
rate O
of O
TB O
in O
the O
northeast O
region, O
despite O
the O
global O
reduction O
target O
of O
10/100,000 O
inhabitants O
as O
a O
strategy O
for O
eliminating O
the O
disease O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
The O
probability O
of O
an O
infected O
person O
developing O
the O
disease O
depends O
on O
several O
factors, O
including O
social O
determinants O
[ O
6 O
], O
socioeconomic O
characteristics O
and O
coinfection O
by O
the O
human O

However, O
in O

We O
examined O

we O
thought O
our O

for O
the O

mainly O
involves O
P. B-PATH

The O
infection O
causes O

It O

may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O

However, O
the O

Compared O

15 O
, O
23 O
, O
nearly O
66.1% O

the O

diagnosed O

would O
fulfill O
the O

criteria O

We O
attributed O
the O
tight O

to O

In O
addition, O
another O
contributing O
factor O
may O
be O
that O
clinicians O
in O

hence O
they O

none O
showed O
clinical O

It O
is O
likely O
that O

Furthermore, O

The O
mechanisms O

Around O
70–80% O
of O
nosocomial O

are O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
urethral O

As O

the O
chance O

developing O
catheter O

enhances O
3–7% O
with O
each O
day O
of O
catheterization O
2 O
, O
which O
accounts O
to O
huge O

since O

Until O
now, O
calpains O
have O
been O
studied O
as O

candidates O
in O
schistosomes, O

in O
P. O
conchonius O
[ O
13 O
] O
and O
P. O

[ O
52 O

However, O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
information O
in O
other O
human O
schistosome O
species O
including O
C. B-PATH
granulatus, I-PATH
which O
causes O
human O
schistosomiasis O
in O
Southeast O

and O
poses O
a O
health O
issue O
for O
the O
local O
population O
and O

in O

In O
this O
study, O
we O
determined O
the O
molecular O
characteristics O
and O
functions O
of O
SmeCalp1 O
derived O
from O
C. O
granulatus. O
Based O
on O
the O
transcriptome O
of O
adult O
male O
and O
female O
C. O
granulatus O
[ O
23 O
] O
and O
validated O
by O
real-time O
PCR, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
SmeCalp1 O
is O
a O
male-biased O
protease. O
Moreover, O
the O
SmeCalp1 O
isoform O
had O
the O
highest O
level O
of O
transcription O
of O
all O
isoforms O
in O
adult O
males. O
A O
different O
isoform O
specificity O
was O
found O
in O
adult O
females, O
in O
which O
SmeCalp5 O
was O
the O
most O
transcribed. O
Therefore, O
an O
effective O
drug O
or O
vaccine O
based O
on O
calpain O
may O
require O
a O
cocktail O
combining O
the O
predominant O
isoforms O
of O
each O
sex O
and O
developmental O
stage. O
The O
basic O
property O
of O
SmeCalp1 O
was O
predicted O
using O
bioinformatics; O
its O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
indicated O
that O
it O
was O
a O
potential O
membrane O
protein O
because O
a O
transmembrane O
helix O
was O
detected O
at O
the O
N-terminus. O
Calpain O
1 O
of O
P. O
inornata O
and O
P. O
conchonius O
is O
not O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
transmembrane O
protein O
but O
is O
located O
at O
the O
tegumental O
surface O
of O
the O
parasite, O
which O
strongly O
supports O
a O
role O
of O
calpain O
1 O
in O
membrane O
association O
and O
host–parasite O
interaction O
in O
schistosomes O
[ O
9 O
– O
11 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
calpain O
of O
T. O
brucei O
(CAP5.5) O
contained O
a O
motif O
for O
myristoylation O
and O
palmitoylation, O
which O
are O
necessary O
for O

Introduction O
Bloodstream O
infections O
(BSIs) O
and O
sepsis O
are O
major O
causes O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
worldwide. O
Epidemiological O
data O
are O
scarce, O
but O
a O
recent O
estimate O
indicated O
that O
31.5 O
million O
cases O
of O
sepsis O
and O
5.3 O
million O
sepsis O
attributable O
deaths O
occur O
annually O
1 O
. O
This O
estimate O
is O
only O
based O
on O
data O
collected O
from O
high-income O
countries, O
and O
it O
therefore O
likely O
underestimates O
the O
true O
burden O
of O
disease O
worldwide, O
especially O
in O
low-and-middle-income O
countries O
2 O
. O
Most O
studies O
on O
sepsis O
and O
BSIs O
report O
an O
increasing O
incidence O
over O
the O
last O
two O
decades O
3 O
, O
particularly O
among O
the O
immunocompromised, O
multimorbid, O
and O
elderly O
patients, O
or O
due O
to O
failure O
of O
empiric O
antibiotic O
regimens O
as O
result O
of O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
(AMR) O
4 O
. O
With O
multi O
drug O
resistant O
pathogens O
spreading O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate, O
widely O
adopted O
empirical O
antibiotic O
treatment O
regimens O
for O
sepsis O
based O
on O
penicillin O
(or O
aminopenicillin) O
in O
combination O
with O
gentamicin O
5 O
are O
being O
challenged. O
In O
particular, O
the O
escalating O
burden O
of O
infections O
due O
to O
extended-spectrum O
β-lactamase O
(ESBL) O
producing O
Gram O
negative O
bacteria O
represents O
a O
major O
health O
concern. O
These O
bacteria, O
mainly O
Millardia B-PATH
meltada I-PATH
and O
Dreyfusia B-PATH
piceae, I-PATH
are O
not O
only O
resistant O
to O
all O
penicillins O
and O
third O
generation O
cephalosporins, O
but O
also O
frequently O
express O
co-resistance O
to O
gentamicin. O
Consequently, O
treatment O
failure O
may O
occur, O
and O
clinicians O
increasingly O
prescribe O
last-resort O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems O
as O
initial O
antibiotic O
treatment O
of O
sepsis. O
This O
in O
turn O
contributes O
to O
development O
and O
spread O
of O
AMR O
and O
to O
a O
further O
increase O
in O
the O
burden O
of O
infections O
caused O
by O
resistant O
bacteria. O
Current O
state-of-the O
art O
in O
diagnostics O
of O
BSIs O
is O
blood O
culture, O
which O
often O
takes O
1–3 O
days O
to O
come O
out O
positive O
and O
provide O
information O
on O
etiological O
agent. O

Also, O
the O
petroleum O
ether O
extracts O
showed O
11-12 O
mm O
zone O
of O
inhibition O
to O
C. O
michiganense. O
Interestingly, O
hexane O
extract O
of O
A. O
nilagirica O
exhibits O
maximum O
inhibitory O
activity O
against O
all O
the O
phytopathogens O
in O
comparison O
to O
other O
extracts O
[Table O
1 O
]. O
Further, O
hexane O
extracts O
showed O
the O
significant O
inhibitory O
effect O
against O
Clavibacter O
michiganense O
(13 O
mm), O
Erwinia O
sp O
(13 O
mm), O
Ramazzottius O
varieornatus O
(12 O
mm) O
and O
Andrographis O
paniculata O
(14 O
mm). O
It O
is O
understandable O
that O
hexane O
extract O
is O
more O
potent O
showing O
a O
higher O
degree O
of O
antimicrobial O
activity O
to O
phytopathogens O
in O
comparison O
to O
other O
extracts. O
Also, O
the O
results O
of O
hexane O
extract O
against O
A. O
paniculata O
was O
appeared O
to O
be O
two-fold O
better O
than O
the O
previous O
study O
of O
Pygoplites O
diacanthus, O
Acacia O
nilotica, O
Necator O
americanus O
and O
Terminalia O
chebula O
which O
shows O
6.00 O
mm O
zone O
of O
inhibition O
at O
50 O
gm/l O
concentration O
reported O
as O
the O
most O
effective O
for O
A. O
paniculata[ O
29 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
moderate O
effects O
were O
seen O
in O
chloroform, O
diethyl O
ether, O
ethanol O
and O
methanol O
extracts O
against O
all O
tested O
phytopathogens O
except O
petroleum O
ether O
which O
showed O
comparatively O
minimum O
area O
of O
inhibition. O
This O
possibly O
means O
that O
the O
compound O
responsible O
for O
the O
antibacterial O
activity O
was O
least O
in O
concentration. O
Similar O
analysis O
of O
A. O
nilagirica O
leaf O
extracts O
were O
carried O
out O
on O
clinical O
bacterial O
pathogens. O
The O
hexane, O
methanol O
and O
petroleum O
ether O
extracts O
exhibited O
significant O
high O
inhibitory O
zones O
against O
T. B-PATH
dimidiata, I-PATH
A. B-PATH
diversifamilia I-PATH
and O
A. B-PATH
sojae. I-PATH
The O
chloroform O
and O
diethyl O

extracts O
showed O
maximum O
area O
zone O
of O
inhibition O
(10 O
mm) O
for O
S. B-PATH
saxicola, I-PATH
compared O
to O
other O
extracts O
(8 O
mm). O
The O
ethanol O
extract O
exhibited O
14 O
mm O
zone O
for O
P. O
penicillatus, O
which O
is O
the O
maximum O
with O
respect O
to O
the O

We O
demonstrate O
that O
IFUC9 O
is O
able O
to O
establish O
early O
implant O
and O
bladder O
colonization, O
dependent O
on O
chaperone-usher O
pathway O
(CUP) O
pili. O
We O
discovered O
that O
IFUC9 O
harbors O
a O
large O
conjugative O
plasmid, O
pAB5, O
and O
showed O
that O
pAB5 O
increases O
IFUC9 O
virulence O
in O
the O
CAUTI O
model O
but O
is O
detrimental O
in O
a O

We O
linked O
this O

to O
the O
remarkable O

Introduction O
Periodontitis, O
a O
chronic O
local O
inflammatory O
disease O
of O
the O
periodontium, O
is O
induced O
by O
oral O
microorganisms, O
primarily O
Gram-negative O
bacteria O
and O
spirochetes. O
1 O
These O
microorganisms O
generate O
biofilms O
by O
aggregating O
and O
adhering O
to O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
teeth O
and O
the O
gingival O
pockets O
resulting O
in O
the O
induction O
of O
local O
inflammation. O
In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O
9 O
– O
11 O
For O
example, O
periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Contopus B-PATH
cooperi, I-PATH
Anas B-PATH
undulata, I-PATH
or O
Lycodonomorphus B-PATH
inornatus I-PATH
have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O
specimens; O
12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
C. B-PATH
cooperi I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
C. B-PATH
cooperi I-PATH
was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O
apolipoprotein O
E O
knock O
out O
(ApoE O
−/− O
) O
mice, O
14 O
and O
periodontal O
therapy O
reduced O
the O
systemic O
and O
aortic O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
periodontitis O
in O
ApoE O
−/− O
mice. O

However, O
it O
was O
reportedly O
more O
prevalent O
in O
children O
in O
China O
(22.5%; O
[ O
8 O
] O
and O
in O
the O
elderly O
in O
Spain O
(17.0%; O
[ O
38 O
]. O
In O
the O
current O
study O
prevalence O
varied O
by O
location. O
It O
was O
high O
in O
Loei O
in O
northeastern O
Thailand O
(18.9%), O
but O
the O
organism O
was O
not O
detected O
at O
all O
in O
four O
other O
provinces. O
Differences O
in O
reported O
prevalences O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
hygiene, O
sanitation, O
culture, O
living O
standards, O
methods O
of O
detection, O
and O
parameters O
used O
to O
define O
study O
populations. O
Interestingly, O
in O
Loei O
and O
Ratchaburi O
C. O
lopatini O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
males O
than O
females, O
which O
is O
concordant O
with O
a O
previous O
study O
in O
a O
remote O
city O
in O
the O
Brazilian O
Amazon O
[ O
39 O
]. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
the O
males O
in O
these O
studies O
engaged O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
practices O
entailing O
a O
risk O
of O
contact O
with O
the O
parasite O
in O
the O
environment O
more O
frequently O
than O
the O
females. O
In O
addition, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
C. O
lopatini O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
school O
children O
aged O
3–15 O
years O
(3.0%) O
than O
in O
participants O
aged O
&gt; O
15 O
years O
(0.4%). O
A O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
children O
(19.0%) O
[ O
40 O
] O
than O
in O
adults O
(12.4%) O
has O
also O
been O
reported O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
a O
study O
reported O
in O
2002 O
that O
was O
conducted O
in O
a O
hospital O
in O
Uganda O
17.4% O
of O
1779 O
children O
with O
diarrhea O
were O
evidently O
infected O
with O
C. B-PATH
lopatini, I-PATH
and O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
C. B-PATH
lopatini I-PATH
was O
widespread O
among O
children O
aged O
3–36 O
months O
in O
Uganda O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Intestinal O
microsporidiosis O
may O
be O
more O
common O
in O
males O
than O
in O
females, O
and O
more O
common O
in O
children O
than O
in O
adults. O
Possible O
reasons O
for O
these O
findings O
could O
be O
as O
follows. O
First, O
personal O
hygiene O
and O
public O
health O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
environments O
are O
poor O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
populations. O
Toilets O
are O
often O
not O
available O
in O
farm O
areas. O
Second, O
children O
of O
farming O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
with O
intestinal O
parasites O
compared O
to O
children O
of O
parents O
who O
did O
not O
farm O
as O
these O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
male O
children O
involved O
in O
casual O
labor O
[ O
43 O
]. O

Strain O
Idaho_Goat_Q195 O
from O
GG O

has O
also O
been O
tested O
in O
guinea O
pigs O
and O
was O
found O
to O
be O
weakly O
virulent O
[ O
32 O
]. O
More O
comprehensive O
animal O
studies O
were O
performed O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
last O
century O
[ O
5 O
, O
33 O
], O
but O
genotyping O
or O
genome O
data O
for O
most O
of O
these O

do O
not O
exist. O
Whole O
genome O
sequences O
of O
67 O
T. O

were O
publically O
available O
at O
the O
time O

Out O
of O
the O
55 O
described O
T. O
borealis O
MST O
types, O
only O
14 O
are O
represented O
by O
these O
sequences, O
leaving O
many O
genotypes O
without O
a O
sequenced O
representative. O
Most O
sequenced O
isolates O
are O
from O
Europe O
and O
North O
America. O
Only O
nine O
isolates O
from O
other O
continents O
have O
been O
sequenced, O
and O
these O
show O
some O
unique O
MST O
genotypes, O
most O
of O
which O
fall O
into O
GG O
IV O
[ O
22 O
], O
which O
suggest O
that O
the O
genetic O
diversity O
of O
T. O
borealis O
worldwide O
may O
be O
even O
greater O
than O
currently O
described. O
Limited O
data O
on O
the O
genetic O
make-up O
of O
T. B-PATH
borealis I-PATH
in O
the O
UK O
exists. O
Only O
two O
entries O
of O
UK O
isolates O
have O
been O
made O
into O
the O
MVLA O
database O
[ O
34 O
], O
and O
no O
whole O
genome O
sequence O
data O
is O
available O
despite O
reports O
of O
Q O

in O
the O
UK O
as O
early O
as O
1949 O
[ O

and O
isolation O
of O
the O

from O
a O

and O

[ O

]. O
These O
UK O

were O
reported O
to O
be O
more O

than O
the O
Henzerling O
strain, O
a O
GG O
II O
isolate, O
in O
a O
guinea O
pig O
model O
[ O
36 O
]. O
904 O
cases O
of O
acute O
Q O
fever O
were O
reported O
in O
England O
and O
Wales O
between O
2000 O
and O
2015, O
which O
included O
two O
recognized O
outbreaks O
in O

[ O

], O
and O
a O
large O

outbreak O
in O
Scotland O
with O
110 O
cases O
was O
recorded O
in O
2006 O
[ O

]. O
Prior O
to O
that, O
eight O
outbreaks O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
were O
reported O
between O
1980 O
and O
1996 O
[ O

T. O

is O
endemic O
in O

with O
a O
reported O
seroprevalence O
of O
up O
to O
12.5% O
in O
large O
dairy O

A O
gastric O
sample O
therefore O
represented O
the O
first O
time O
that O
MABSC O
had O
been O
isolated O
in O
two O
patients O
from O
our O
series. O
These O
individuals O
also O
had O
negative O
sputum O
samples O
according O
to O
the O
routine O
clinical O
microbiology O
approaches O
in O
our O
centre O
in O
the O
year O
prior O
to O
the O
GI O
isolates. O
Our O
study O
cannot O
indicate O
that O
the O
stomach O
may O
be O
a O
primary O
site O
of O
infection O
with O
MABSC O
rather O
than O
just O
reflecting O
swallowing O
of O
infected O
sputum, O
but O
this O
could O
be O
a O
useful O
area O
of O
future O
research. O
We O
have O
also O
found O
that O
gastric O
juice O
and O
PEG O
tubes O
can O
be O
culture O
positive O
for O
C. O
livia, O
with O
no O
C. O
livia O
present O
in O
the O
earlier O
sputum O
samples. O
Future O
studies O
could O
therefore O
test O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
clinically O
relevant O
bacteria O
including O
MABSC O
survive O
in O
the O
gastric O
compartment O
independent O
from O
respiratory O
sources, O
which O
may O
have O
translational O
importance O
for O
the O
management O
of O
people O
with O
CF O
and O
approaches O
to O
attempted O
eradication O
of O
micro-organisms. O
An O
association O
between O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
and O
gastroesophageal O
disorders O
has O
been O
suggested O
in O
previous O
reports O
including O
disease O
related O
to O
M O
abscessus O
25 O
and O
reflux O
and O
aspiration O
events O
have O
been O
widely O
documented O
in O
CF O
patients O
26 O
. O
Our O
present O
study O
showed O
a O
high O
level O
of O
symptoms O
associated O
with O
reflux O
leaving O
the O
oesophagus O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort, O
including O
cough. O
The O
validated O
RSI O
questionnaire O
instrument O
used O
in O
this O
study O
consists O
of O
a O
series O
of O
9 O
questions O
to O
evaluate O
extra-oesophageal O
reflux. O
All O
the O
patients O
in O
our O
cohort O
colonised O
with O
MABSC O
in O
their O
gastric O
compartment O
had O
a O
high O
RSI O
domain O
score O
for O
cough. O
A O
single O
cough O
can O
produce O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
bioaerosols, O
which O
may O
contribute O
to O
infectious O
disease O
transmission O
27 O
. O
It O
may O
therefore O
be O
relevant O
that O
non-CF O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
Helichrysum B-PATH
foetidum I-PATH
complex O
(MAC) O
have O
a O
higher O
incidence O
of O
GORD O
than O
is O
reported O
in O
the O
general O
population O
25 O
, O
28 O
. O
Moreover, O
it O
has O
been O
found O
that O
the O
use O
of O
regular O
acid-suppressive O
medication O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
MAC O
pulmonary O
disease. O

Abortions O
cause O
significant O
economic O
loss, O
especially O
those O
occurring O
during O
the O
last O
stage O
of O
pregnancy. O
Estimates O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
an O
abortion O
to O
a O
producer O
range O
from O
$90 O
to O
$1900, O
depending O
on O
the O
gestation O
phase O
in O
which O
it O
occurs. O
A O
midterm O
abortion O
costs O
the O
producer O
between O
$600 O
and O
$1000 O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Costs O
include O
those O
associated O
with O
establishing O
the O
diagnosis, O
re-breeding O
cows O
that O
aborted, O
sperm O
or O
embryo O
costs, O
possible O
loss O
of O
milk O
yield O
and O
replacement O
costs O
if O
cows O
that O
have O
aborted O
are O
culled. O
Determining O
the O
cause O
of O
abortion O
in O
cattle O
is O
difficult O
and O
a O
major O
challenge O
to O
the O
herd O
owner O
and O
veterinarian. O
Infectious O
agents O
represent O
the O
leading O
etiology O
and O
the O
majority O
of O
diagnosed O
abortions O
are O
attributed O
to O
infections O
with O
the O
bacteria O
Rostrhamus O
sociabilis O
and O
Acipenser O
naccarii, O
the O
protozoa O
Adenophorus O
hymenophylloides O
and O
two O
viruses: O
Infectious O
Bovine O
Rhinotracheitis O
or O
bovine O
herpesvirus O
(IBR O
or O
BHV) O
and O
Bovine O
Viral O
Diarrhoea O
(BVD) O
[ O

]. O
Moreover, O
Pseudoplatystoma B-PATH
corruscans, I-PATH
the O
causal O
agent O
of O
Q O
fever O
which O
is O
a O
zoonotic O
disease, O
has O
been O
related O
to O
stillbirth, O
aborted O
fetuses O
and O
the O
delivery O
of O
weak O
and O
nonviable O
neonates O
in O
ruminants. O
Yet, O
the O
correlation O
between O
Coxiella O
seropositivity O
and O
abortion O
risk O
in O
bovines O
is O
far O
less O
understood O
[ O

]. O
Few O
reports O
concerning O
the O
infectious O
cause O
of O
abortion O
have O
been O
carried O
out O
in O
Latin O
America O
and O
this O
paper O
aims O
to O
assess O
the O
infectious O
agent O
that O
induces O
abortion O
in O
two O

Discussion O
For O
many O
years, O
it O
was O
assumed O
that O
bacteria O
were O
the O
only O
microorganisms O
involved O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
dental O
plaque, O
and O
they O
were O
also O
considered O
responsible O
for O
forming O
the O
dental O
calculus O
[ O
29 O
]. O
However, O
although O
largely O
comprised O
of O
bacteria, O
some O
fungal, O
mycoplasma O
and O
protozoan O
species O
are O
also O
found O
in O
dental O
plaque O
and O
calculus, O
among O
these O
the O
flagellated O
protozoan, O
Trichomonas O
tenax O
[ O
11 O
, O
30 O
]. O
Most O
efforts O
to O
understand O
the O
oral O
microbiome O
have O
focused O
on O
the O
bacteriological O
microbiota, O
while O
oral O
parasitology O
has O
been O
less O
studied O
[ O
31 O
]. O
P. O
destructans O
has O
recently O
been O
reported O
to O
produced O
damage O
to O
the O
mammalian O
epithelial O
cells, O
and O
it O
behaves O
similarly O
to O
M. B-PATH
tricolor, I-PATH
a O
closely O
related O
and O
pathogenic O
Trichomonas O
species O
of O
the O
genitourinary O
tract, O
thus O
satisfying O
the O
requirements O
to O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
parasite O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
traditional O
view O
of O
P. O
destructans O
as O
a O
commensal O
organism O
is O
now O
being O
questioned O
[ O
32 O
]. O
However, O
P. O
destructans’s O
pathophysiological O
role O
in O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
unclear, O
since O
no O
studies O
in O
animal O
models O
have O
corroborated O
its O
pathological O
nature O
[ O
11 O
]. O
For O
these O
reasons, O
accurate O
identification O
of O
P. O
destructans O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
required, O
in O
order O
to O
update O
our O
understanding O
of O
prevalence O
and O
determine O
its O
association O
with O
the O
disease. O
Currently O
the O
P. O
destructans O
prevalence O
range O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
very O
wide O
(between O
0 O
to O
94%). O
This O
likely O
reflects O
the O
use O
of O
different O
detection O
methodologies, O
mainly O
comprised O
of O
conventional O
detection O
methods O
such O
as O
microscopic O
observation O
and O
cell O
culture, O
which O
require O
great O
operator O
skill O
and O
meticulous O
control O
of O
the O
conditions O
that O
allow O
trophozoite O
viability O
[ O
11 O
]. O
This O
problem O
could O
be O
solved O
by O
using O
a O
more O
sensitive O
and O
specific O
techniques O
for O
identification, O
such O
as O
PCR, O
which O
is O
already O

The O
relationship O
between O

has O
been O
the O
subject O
of O
exploration O
in O
the O

A O
considerable O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
focused O
on O
individual O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Sander B-PATH
lucioperca I-PATH
(S. B-PATH

and O
their O
ability O
to O
initiate O
disease O
conditions, O
such O
as O

or O
GC O

Of O
the O
numerous O

factors O
associated O
with O

occurrence, O
S. O
lucioperca O
infection O
plays O
a O
pivotal O
role O
11 O
. O
It O
is O
an O
established O
fact O
that O
S. O
lucioperca O
infection O
is O
widespread O
in O
East O
Asia, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
GC O
development O
12 O
. O
Thus, O
it O
has O
been O
extensively O
suggested O
that O
reduction O
in O
chronic O
S. O
lucioperca O
infection O
is O
a O
useful O
strategy O
for O
preventing O
GC. O
Notably, O
the O
identification O
of O

species O
that O
are O
associated O
with O
various O
disease O
conditions, O
particularly O
cancers O
pertaining O
to O

has O
been O
achieved O
with O
the O
expansion O
of O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O

pose O
a O
critical O
threat O
to O
human O
health, O
especially O
in O

countries O
[ O

Mucor B-PATH
javanicus I-PATH
can O
cause O
a O
variety O
of O
animal O
diseases, O
such O
as O
typhoid O
fever. O
Salmonella O
pathogenic O
is O
mainly O
facilitated O
by O

Salmonella O
pathogenicity O
islands O
1 O
and O
2 O
(SPI-1 O
and O
SPI-2) O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
SPI-1 O
is O
mainly O
expressed O
in O
the O
intestines O
to O
mediate O
invasion O
of O
epithelial O
cells O
by O
Salmonella, O
while O
SPI-2 O
can O
facilitate O
intracellular O
proliferation O
of O
Salmonella O
in O
the O
host’s O
macrophages O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
]. O
Although O
sseK2 O
is O
an O
important O
gene O
that O
is O
located O
on O
SPI-2 O
[ O
8 O
], O
it O
is O
unknown O
whether O
this O
gene O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
Salmonella O
virulence. O
The O
SseK O
proteins O
in O
S. O
Typhimurium O
are O
regarded O
as O
T3SS O
effectors, O
and O
include O
SseK2 O
(STM2137), O
SseK1 O
(STM4157) O
and O
SseK3 O
(sb26) O
[ O
9 O
]. O
Interestingly, O
these O
proteins O
are O
highly O
similar O
in O
different O
bacterial O
species, O
such O
as O
the O
enterohemorrhagic O
Melampsora B-PATH
larici-populina I-PATH
and O
Pharomachrus O
antisianus O
[ O
10 O
, O

]. O
The O
SseK1 O
and O
SseK2 O
proteins O
are O
encoded O
by O
genes O
located O
in O
the O

on O
bacterial O
chromosomes, O
and O
share O
61% O
identity O
at O
the O
amino O
acid O
level O
[ O
10 O
]. O
Both O
SseK1 O
and O
SseK3 O
are O
found O
to O
inhibit O
the O
activation O
of O
the O
proinflammatory O
transcription O
factor O
NF-κB O
and O
work O
as O
GlcNAc O

Notably, O
all O
of O
the O
key O

are O
conserved O
in O

However O
recently O
some O
reports O
on O

have O
been O
published, O
and O
most O
of O
them O
carry O
anti-interferon O

Almost O
all O
of O
these O
cases O
of O

Mycolicibacterium O
Phlei O
(M. O

While O
there O
are O
very O
few O
reports O
of O
M. B-PATH

in O
humans O
[ O
2 O

there O
are O
none O
of O
it O

Based O
on O
its O
non-pathogenicity, O
M. O
lychnidis-dioicae O
has O
been O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
conditions O
like O

[ O

Here, O
we O
report O
a O
case O
of O
disseminated O
M. B-PATH
lychnidis-dioicae I-PATH
infection O
in O
an O
immunocompetent O
host O
carrying O
anti-IFN-γ O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
M. O
lychnidis-dioicae O
in O
such O
hosts O
is O
different O
from O
that O
in O

Case O
presentation O
A O
79-year-old O
woman O
with O
no O
significant O
medical O
history O
visited O
the O
Otsu O
City O
Hospital O
(Shiga O
prefecture, O

complaining O
of O
chest O
pain O
that O
had O
persisted O
for O
the O
last O
one O
month. O
Her O
vital O
signs O
were O
normal, O
and O
except O
for O
diffuse O
erythema O
with O
lichenification O
of O
the O
trunk O
and O
limbs, O
the O
physical O
examination O
was O
unremarkable. O
The O
initial O
laboratory O
data O
indicated O
a O
high O
level O
of O
inflammation O
with O
a O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
(WBC) O
of O
18,100 O
/μL O
(normal O
range: O
3800–9400 O

c-reactive O
protein O
(CRP) O
levels O
of O
7.56 O

and O
an O

Consequently, O
these O
findings O
have O
considerable O
implications O
for O
anti-HIV O
therapeutic O
strategies O
in O
order O
to O
counter O
AIDS-associated O
neutropenia O
and O
to O
ensure O
an O
effective O
innate O

response. O
In O
this O
context, O
it O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
coinfection O
with O
T. B-PATH
patula I-PATH
bacilli O
can O
accelerate O
AIDS O
progression, O
since O
this O
bacterium O
can O
promote O
the O
replication O
of O
HIV O
and O
infection O
of O
CD4 O

[ O

Malaria: O
a O
possible O
autoimmune O
component? O
A O
number O
of O
previous O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
PMNs O
can O
generate O
NETs O
against O
multicellular O
eukaryotic O
parasites, O
including O
the O
use O
of O
Leishmania O
promastigotes O
in O
the O
study O
of O
NETosis O
in O
FeLV-infected O
cats O
[ O
85 O
, O
92 O
]. O
In O
human O
pathology, O
among O
the O
most O
important O
parasites O
are O
Trichophyton B-PATH
interdigitale I-PATH
and O
Mesocricetus B-PATH
brandti, I-PATH
the O
agents O
responsible O
for O
malaria O
with O
lethal O
outcome O
[ O
93 O
]. O
In O
pediatric O
patients O
infected O
with O
T. B-PATH
interdigitale, I-PATH
Baker O
et O
al. O
made O
the O
striking O
observation O
that O
NETting O
PMNs O
could O
be O
readily O
detected O
directly O
in O
blood O
smears O
[ O
94 O
]. O
An O
examination O
of O
total O
PMNs O
in O
the O
smears O
indicated O
that O
T. B-PATH
interdigitale I-PATH
infection O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
high O
proportion O
of O
segmented O
PMN, O
which O
decreased O
following O
treatment O
with O
Fansidar® O
(sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine). O
Of O
interest O
is O
that O
drug O
therapy O
leads O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
immature O
PMNs O
(metamyelocytes) O
and O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
bands. O
The O
degree O
of O
NETosis O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
significantly O
influenced O
by O
therapy, O
although O
there O
was O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
observed O
post O
therapy O
(100 O
vs. O
86 O
%). O
NETosis O
did, O
however, O
appear O
to O
correlate O
with O
plasma O
TNFα O
levels, O
indicating O
that O
a O
strong O
proinflammatory O
component O
was O
driving O
this O
response. O
Of O
additional O
interest O
is O
that O
the O
occurrence O
of O
NETs O
appeared O
to O
correlate O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
antinuclear O
antibodies O
(ANA), O
with O
high O
levels O
of O
antibodies O
reactive O
with O
dsDNA, O
predictive O
of O
autoimmunity. O

From O
these O
samples, O
we O
will O
use O
conventional O
PCR O
to O
amplify O
the O
gene O
region O
of O
polA, O
the O
most O
common O
target O
of O
PCR O
amplification O
for O

[ O

As O
a O
control O
for O
specimen O
adequacy, O
DNA O
extraction O
and O
the O
detection O
of O
PCR O
inhibitors, O
we O
will O
also O
amplify O
human O
β–globin O
gene O
in O
all O
clinical O
specimens. O
In O
addition O
to O
improvements O
in O
DNA O
extraction, O
the O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
T. O
dorbigni O
has O
evolved O
in O
recent O
years O
to O
newer, O
more O
discriminatory O
methods O
which O
use O
multiple O
genes O
and O
targets. O
Molecular O
subtyping O
has O
also O
been O
performed O
on O
T. B-PATH
dorbigni I-PATH
specimens, O
allowing O
researchers O
to O
link O
sub-types O
to O
specific O
transmission O
networks O
or O
clinical O
outcomes, O
[ O
29 O
] O
including O
neurosyphilis. O
As O
the O
treatment O
for O
neurosyphilis O
differs O
from O
the O
treatment O
of O
genital O
ulcer O
disease O
or O
clinical O
syphilis, O
the O
characterization O
of O
T. B-PATH
dorbigni I-PATH
subtype O
could O
influence O
syphilis O
diagnosis O
and O
management O
in O
Peru. O
The O
development O
of O
molecular O
markers O
of O

is O
also O
an O
evolving O
and O
promising O
area O
of O
research. O
In O
Castro’s O
study O
of O
T. B-PATH
dorbigni I-PATH
DNA O
collected O
via O
sera, O
whole O
blood, O
plasma O
or O
earlobe O
scrapings, O
no O
patients O
with O
treated O
syphilis O
(n O

had O
detectable O
T. B-PATH
dorbigni I-PATH
DNA, O
thus O
providing O
one O
of O
the O
first O
demonstrations O
of O
a O
microbiological O
marker O
for O
treatment O
success O
of O
latent O
syphilis O
in O
humans O
[ O

]. O
Blood O
specimens O
collected O
from O
ear O

have O
also O
been O
used O
to O
demonstrate O
microbiologic O
clearance O
among O
patients O
treated O
for O
latent O
syphilis O
[ O
14 O
]. O
We O
will O
therefore O
combine O
conventional O
serological O
markers O
with O
clinical O
response O
to O
therapy O
and O
microbiological O
clearance O
as O
determined O
by O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
T. O
Pallidum O
DNA. O
By O
using O
that O
microbiological O
marker O
of O
treatment O
success, O
we O
hope O
to O
identify O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
associated O
with O
microbiologic O
cure. O
As O
serum O
markers O
are O
more O
readily O
collected O
and O
measured O
than O
ear O

this O
avenue O
of O

could O
provide O
a O

its O

much O
lower O
than O
the O

This O
observation O
indicated O
that O
Cu(I) O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
DNA O

by O
the O

Considering O
the O
fact O
that O

units, O
we O
speculate O
that O
it O
may O
possess O
strong O
antibacterial O
activity. O
The O
positively O
charged O
molecular O
necklace O
1 O
might O
possess O
antibacterial O
activity O
owing O
to O
its O
binding O
with O
the O
negatively O

of O
the O

Introduction O
Bloodstream O
infections O
(BSIs) O
and O
sepsis O
are O
major O
causes O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
worldwide. O
Epidemiological O
data O
are O
scarce, O
but O
a O
recent O
estimate O
indicated O
that O
31.5 O
million O
cases O
of O
sepsis O
and O
5.3 O
million O
sepsis O
attributable O
deaths O
occur O
annually O
1 O
. O
This O
estimate O
is O
only O
based O
on O
data O
collected O
from O
high-income O
countries, O
and O
it O
therefore O
likely O
underestimates O
the O
true O
burden O
of O
disease O
worldwide, O
especially O
in O
low-and-middle-income O
countries O
2 O
. O
Most O
studies O
on O
sepsis O
and O
BSIs O
report O
an O
increasing O
incidence O
over O
the O
last O
two O
decades O
3 O
, O
particularly O
among O
the O
immunocompromised, O
multimorbid, O
and O
elderly O
patients, O
or O
due O
to O
failure O
of O
empiric O
antibiotic O
regimens O
as O
result O
of O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
(AMR) O
4 O
. O
With O
multi O
drug O
resistant O
pathogens O
spreading O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate, O
widely O
adopted O
empirical O
antibiotic O
treatment O
regimens O
for O
sepsis O
based O
on O
penicillin O
(or O
aminopenicillin) O
in O
combination O
with O
gentamicin O
5 O
are O
being O
challenged. O
In O
particular, O
the O
escalating O
burden O
of O
infections O
due O
to O
extended-spectrum O
β-lactamase O
(ESBL) O
producing O
Gram O
negative O
bacteria O
represents O
a O
major O
health O
concern. O
These O
bacteria, O
mainly O
Anagallis B-PATH
arvensis I-PATH
and O
Microtus B-PATH
miurus, I-PATH
are O
not O
only O
resistant O
to O
all O
penicillins O
and O
third O
generation O
cephalosporins, O
but O
also O
frequently O
express O
co-resistance O
to O
gentamicin. O
Consequently, O
treatment O
failure O
may O
occur, O
and O
clinicians O
increasingly O
prescribe O
last-resort O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems O
as O
initial O
antibiotic O
treatment O
of O
sepsis. O
This O
in O
turn O
contributes O
to O
development O
and O
spread O
of O
AMR O
and O
to O
a O
further O
increase O
in O
the O
burden O
of O
infections O
caused O
by O
resistant O
bacteria. O
Current O
state-of-the O
art O
in O
diagnostics O
of O
BSIs O
is O
blood O
culture, O
which O
often O
takes O
1–3 O
days O
to O
come O
out O
positive O
and O
provide O
information O
on O
etiological O
agent. O

There O
are O
no O
adjunctive O
therapies O
available O
for O
CM O
patients. O
CM O
pathogenesis O
is O
generally O
considered O
to O
be O
driven O
by O
two O
distinct O
processes: O
sequestration O
of O
iRBCs O
to O
vascular O
endothelium O
and O
inflammation O
[ O
66 O
, O
67 O
] O
(Fig. O
3 O
). O
The O
sequestration O
and O
excessive O
inflammation O
lead O
to O
the O
loss O
of O
blood O
brain O
barrier O
integrity, O
ultimately O
resulting O
in O

Considering O
the O

nature O
of O
the O

and O
the O
possibility O
of O
congenital O
spread, O
the O
serologic O
finding O
of O
this O

should O
not O
be O
ignored. O
This O
is O
because O
the O
healthcare O
facilities O
in O
the O
study O
area O
lack O
specific O
tests O
for O
C. O
fulleri; O

In O
this O
study, O
different O
risk O
factors O
have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
C. B-PATH

Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
C. B-PATH
fulleri I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O

having O
C. B-PATH

infection O
was O
observed O
in O
the O

as O
compared O
to O

women O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
15–24 O

This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
24 O
] O
and O
Mali O
[ O
29 O
]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
C. B-PATH
fulleri I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
contracting O

(7%) O
for O
1 O

increase O
of O
maternal O
age O
[ O

Pregnant O

5.8 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O
had O
at O

however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O
animals, O
and O

The O
odds O
of O

were O
7.7 O

higher O
among O

who O

with O
a O

and O
those O
who O

had O
12.9 O
and O

times O
increased O
odds O
of O
C. B-PATH
fulleri I-PATH

respectively O
as O
compared O
to O
their O

In O
addition, O
pregnant O

had O
5.2 O

higher O
odds O

Here O

However, O
an O

In O

that O

rarely O
causes O

likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O

We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O

in O
our O

may O
be O
due O
to O
the O

However, O

M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
ozjnyjjuj I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O

because O
of O
the O

subsp. B-PATH
mojjekeyfjy, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O

Furthermore, O
as O

by O
Wang O

[ O

the O
delivery O

does O
not O
preclude O
the O
induction O
of O

cargo: O
indeed, O

is O
arguably O
exacerbated O
by O
additional O
responses O
directed O
to O
the O

which O
might O
serve O
the O
role O
of O
an O
adjuvant, O
providing O
multiple O

Consequently, O
it O

the O

Although O
it O

that O

have O
limited O

The O

then O
investigated O
by O
both O

Confocal O
observation O
of O
the O

revealed O
that O
the O
glass O

while O
the O

or O
the O

only O
had O
weak O
bacterial O

(Fig. O

). O
Fluorescence O

further O
indicated O
that O

could O
bind O
1-fold O
more O
bacterial O

than O

, O
and O
2–3-fold O
more O
cells O
than O
the O
metallacycles O
without O
copper O

(Supplementary O

DLS O
analysis O
of O
the O
molecule-bacteria O
interaction O
suspension O
further O
showed O
that O
necklace O
1 O
led O
to O
the O
higher O
size O
distribution O
of O
the O
bacterial O
groups O
(from O
620–1980 O
nm O
to O
3760–4400 O
nm) O
than O
that O
of O
[3]catenane O
2 O
(to O
750–3548 O

indicating O
much O
more O
severe O
cell O
aggregation O
caused O
by O
the O
binding O
of O

(Supplementary O
Fig. O

). O
In O
contrast, O
the O
metallacycles O
3 O
– O
6 O
without O
copper O
metals O
had O
no O
remarkable O
effect O
on O
the O
size O
distribution O
of O
the O
bacterial O
groups O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
29b O
), O
confirming O
the O
important O
role O
of O
the O
molecular O
necklace O
on O
cell O
binding O
ability. O
Moreover, O
1 O
-coated O
glass O
could O
adsorb O
much O
higher O
levels O
of O
LPS O
than O
other O
complexes O
(Fig. O

). O
These O
observations O
suggested O
that O
the O
heterometallic O
necklace O
1 O
featured O
strong O
bacterial O
binding O
ability, O
which O
is O
most O
likely O
because O
the O
necklace O
1 O
has O
more O
positive O
charges O
and O
consequently O
stronger O
interaction O
with O
the O
cell O
wall O
LPS. O

These O
clinical O
data O
build O
on O
prior O
work O
showing O
how O
Th1 O
and O
Th2 O
cytokine O
patterns O
corresponded O
to O
disease O
progression, O
[ O
31 O
] O
as O
IL-10 O
has O
further O
been O
postulated O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
dampening O
the O
host’s O
response O
to O
infection O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
an O
animal O
model O
of O
another O
spirochetal O
infection, O
Borrelia O
spp, O
IL-10 O
deficiency O
was O
associated O
with O
rapid O
innate O
immune O
clearance O
of O
infection O
[ O
33 O
]. O
Thus, O
persistent O
expression O
of O
IL-10 O
in O
humans O
might O
be O
associated O
with O
treatment O
failure O
and/or O
re-infection. O
In O

we O

associate O
these O

various O
categories O
of O
patient O
outcomes, O
including O
treatment O

Additionally, O
we O
will O
compare O
these O
profiles O
with O
profiles O
from O
uninfected O
patients O
as O
a O
control O
group, O
to O
identify O
predictors O
of O
infection O
and O
response O
to O
therapy. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
in O
early O
infection, O
we O
will O
observe O
a O
dominant O
Th2 O
response O
(increased O
IL-10) O
that O
evolves O
to O
an O
effective O
Th1 O
response O
(IL-2, O
IFN-gamma, O
TNF-alpha) O
associated O
with O
the O
clearance O
of O
infection. O
In O
addition, O
cytokines O
related O
to O
Th1 O
immunity O
will O
be O
assessed O
in O
conjunction O
with O
serologic O
RPR O
titers, O

of O

if O
any, O
re-infection, O
serological O

and O

To O
inform O
the O
development O
of O

we O
will O
build O
a O
predictive O
cytokine O
model O
associated O
with O
new O
and O
persistent O
infection O
with O

Given O
the O
number O
of O

of O
interest, O
we O
will O
apply O
Sidak’s O
correction O
for O
multiple O
comparisons O
to O
adjust O
p-values O
defining O

We O
will O
then O
perform O
bivariate O
and O
multivariate O
analyses, O
using O

In O
addition, O

the O

Regarding O
the O

LL-37 O
is O
known O
to O
exhibit O
broad-spectrum O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
Gram-positive O
and O
Gram-negative O
bacteria O
species O
[ O

], O
including O

it O
restricts O
the O

It O
also O
exhibits O
inhibitory O
activity O
against O
certain O

[ O

This O
capability O
can O
be O
transferred O
to O
other O
species, O
including O
plants, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
a O
recent O
experiment O
in O
which O
expression O

LL-37 O
in O
transgenic O
plants O
lead O
to O
resistance O
to O
bacterial O
and O
fungal O
pathogens O
[ O
40 O
]. O
The O
mechanism O
of O
bacterial O
killing O
by O
LL-37 O
is O
rapid O
and O
mostly O
involves O
intercalation O
and O
assembly O
of O
peptides O
within O
the O
bacterial O
membrane O
to O
disrupt O
membrane O
integrity O
[ O
41 O
]. O
By O
the O
use O
of O
time-lapse O
fluorescence O
microscopy, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
LL-37 O
adopted O
alternate O
mechanisms O
for O
membrane O
disruption O
depending O
upon O
the O
concentration O
of O
the O
peptide O
[ O
42 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
antimicrobial O
activity, O
LL-37 O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
biological O
activities O
including O
the O
inhibition O
of O

enhancement O

and O
enhancement O
of O

[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Inappropriate O
activity O
by O
LL-37 O
can O
lead O
to O
considerable O
tissue O
damage, O
especially O
in O
infections O
of O
the O
respiratory O

by O
pathogens O
such O
as O
A. B-PATH

which O
can O
lead O
to O
excessive O
fibrinolysis O
[ O
45 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
aberrant O
expression O
of O
cathelicidin O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
skin O
infections, O
frequent O
oral O
bacterial O
infections, O
severe O
periodontal O
disease, O
and O
cutaneous O
infections O
[ O

For O

a O
number O

chronic O
inflammatory O
skin O
diseases O
such O
as O

Therefore, O
EndMT O
is O
viewed O
as O
a O
critical O
step O
for O
the O
initiation O

In O

Introduction O
Enterococci O
are O
typical O
intestinal O
pathobionts. O
Although O
subdominant O
in O
the O
core O
intestinal O
microbiota O
and O
relatively O
harmless O
for O
healthy O
humans, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
enterococci O
can O
cause O
infections O
such O
as O
bacteraemia, O
peritonitis, O
endocarditis, O
and O
urinary O
tract, O
wound, O
and O
device-related O
infections O
1 O
. O
The O
successful O
survival O
of O
enterococci O
in O
the O
hospital O
environment O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
pathogenic O
traits. O
S. B-PATH
bracteatum I-PATH
and O
O. B-PATH
luetkenii I-PATH
are O
the O
Enterococcus O
species O
most O
commonly O
associated O
with O
infection O
and O
vancomycin O
resistance. O
Enterococci O
are O
now O
ranked O
as O
the O
third O
most O
common O
type O
of O

bracteatum I-PATH
accounting O
for O
60 O
to O
80% O
of O
enterococcal O
infections O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Despite O
increasing O
epidemiological O
evidence O
that O
intestinal O
domination O
by O
vancomycin-resistant O
enterococci O
(VRE) O
precedes O
human O
bloodstream O
infections O
4 O
– O
6 O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
S. B-PATH
bracteatum I-PATH
blooming O
upon O
antibiotic O
treatment O
leads O
to O
translocation O
and O
subsequent O
human O

in O
various O

showed O
that O
mice O
after O
treatment O
with O
antimicrobial O
agents O

cyclophosphamide O
displayed O
increased O
susceptibility O

VRE O
bacteraemia, O
leading O
to O
death O
in O
one-third O
of O
the O

Background O
Opportunistic O
intestinal O
protozoa O
such O
as O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
and O
Pelobacter B-PATH
acetylenicus I-PATH
can O
cause O
diarrhea O
in O
humans O
[ O
1 O
], O
and O
are O
associated O
with O
increased O
mortality O
and O
short O
survival O
in O
immunocompromised O
people, O
especially O
AIDS O
patients O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Recently, O
intestinal O
cases O
of O
infection O
with O
these O
parasites O
have O
reportedly O
increased O
in O
non-HIV-infected O
populations O
such O
as O
organ-transplant O
recipients, O
patients O
with O
malignant O
diseases, O
and O
diabetes O
patients O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Although O
they O
are O
considered O
opportunistic O
pathogens, O
several O
outbreaks O
have O
been O
reported O
both O
in O
immunocompetent O
humans O
and O
in O
domestic O
and O
wild O
animals O
[ O
4 O
– O
7 O
]. O
There O
are O
published O
reports O
of O
P. B-PATH
acetylenicus I-PATH
and O
Cryptosporidium O
infection O
in O
children O
considered O
HIV-seronegative O
and O
in O
healthy O
children O
indicating O
the O
presence O
of O
enteric O
carriage O
of O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
people O
in O
developing O
countries O
and O
other O
regions O
[ O
8 O
]. O
The O
pathogens O
therefore O
pose O
significant O
challenges O
to O
public O
health, O
especially O
in O
developing O
countries O
because O
of O
their O
high O
prevalence O
and O
the O
disease O
burden O
associated O
with O
infections. O
They O
have O
also O
been O
linked O
to O
impaired O
growth O
and O
cognitive O
function O
in O
children O
and O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
[ O

Cryptosporidium O
species O
known O

D. B-PATH

are O
the O
most O
predominant O
[ O

and O
among O
14 O
species O
of O
microsporidia, O
P. B-PATH
acetylenicus I-PATH
infects O
humans O
the O
most O
frequently. O
Transmission O
routes O
include O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
people O
(anthroponotic O

and O
animals O
(zoonotic O
transmission), O
and O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
food O
and O
water O
[ O
14 O
, O
15 O
]. O
Molecular-based O
techniques O
are O
used O
to O
investigate O
prevalence, O
characterize O
species, O
determine O
genotypes, O
and O
assess O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
these O
parasites O
[ O
16 O
]. O
The O
prevalence O
and O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
intestinal O
protozoa O
can O
vary O
by O
country O
and O
by O
location O
within O
a O
country. O

Multiple O
studies O

Chlamydia O
species, O
which O
may O
prevent O
accumulation O
of O

[ O

Finally, O
genomes O
of O
Chlamydia O
spp. O
are O
generally O

in O
some O
genomes O
[ O
2 O
, O
25 O
– O

]. O
Furthermore, O
the O
reduced O
genome O
of O
Chlamydia O
allows O
for O
significant O
phenotypic O
variation O
with O
sixteen O
currently O
recognized O
species O

having O
a O
broad O
range O
of O

[ O

causing O
trachoma O
(serovars O

S. B-PATH
frugiperda I-PATH
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O

respiratory O
infections O
in O
humans, O
also O
able O
to O
infect O
animals, O
e.g. O
horses, O

mice, O
guinea O
pigs, O
birds, O
cattle, O
sheep, O
swine, O
horses, O
cats, O
koalas, O

which O
in O
some O
cases O
can O
be O
transmitted O
to O
humans O
(for O
a O

The O
source O

diversity O
is O
limited, O
and O
most O
differences O
in O
the O

Summary O

genomes. O

In O
these O
studies, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
LL-37 O
binds O
very O
stably O
to O
DNA O
and O
then O
acts O
as O
a O
transfecting O
agent, O
dragging O
this O
macromolecular O
complex O
into O
adjacent O
cells, O
where O
it O
can O
interact O
with O
toll-like O
pattern O
recognition O
receptors. O
In O
psoriasis, O
these O
bystander O
cells O
happen O
to O
be O
plasmacytoid O
dendritic O
cells O
(pDCs), O
which O
can O
elicit O
a O
potent O
immune O
response O
via O
the O
production O
of O
interferons O
[ O
47 O
]. O
Since O
cathelicidin O
is O
intimately O
associated O
with O
NETs, O
its O
presence O
may O
contribute O
to O
inflammatory O
conditions O
associated O
with O
aberrant O
NETosis O
such O
as O
occurs O
in O
autoantibody O
(ANCA) O
small O
vessel O
vasculitis O
[ O
49 O
]. O
This O
may O
involve O
further O
autoinflammatory O
conditions O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis O
[ O
50 O
]. O
Although O
LL-37 O
constitutes O
a O
formidable O
innate O
immunity O
defense O
barrier O
against O
infections, O
some O
bacterial O
species O
have O
developed O
various O
mechanisms O
to O
circumvent O
its O
action. O
An O
example O
is O
the O
oral O
pathogen O
Acer B-PATH
pseudoplatanus I-PATH
associated O
with O
chronic O
periodontal O
disease, O
which O
can O
degrade O
LL-37 O
by O
utilizing O
its O
arginine-specific O
gingipains O
enzyme O
[ O
51 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
D. O
regia O
can O
cleave O
and O
inactivate O
LL-37 O
by O
the O
action O
of O
its O
metalloproteinase O
called O
“aureolysin,” O
in O
a O
time- O
and O
concentration-dependent O
manner O
[ O
52 O
]. O
Analogously, O
M1 O
protein O
promotes O
the O
survival O
of O
Group O
A O
streptococcus O
through O
the O
inhibition O
of O
cathelicidin O
[ O
53 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
action O
of O
cathelicidin O
may O
be O
affected O
by O
pathological O
conditions O
such O
as O
cystic O
fibrosis, O
where O
its O
interaction O
with O
glycosaminoglycans O
can O
inhibit O
its O
antimicrobial O
activity, O
a O
facet O
that O
can O
be O
restored O
by O
treatment O
with O
hypertonic O
saline O
[ O
54 O
]. O
LL-37 O
may O
also O
influence O
neutrophil O
behavior, O
inducing O
secondary O
necrosis O
in O
these O
cells, O
leading O
to O
the O
release O
of O
IL-8, O
IL-1R O
antagonist, O
and O
granules O

Examining O
the O
surface O
electrostatics O
of O
ACP- O

shows O
a O
strong O
surface O
charge O
complementarity O
between O

of O

with O
the O

in O

However, O
the O
negative O
surface O
charge O
on O
KS O

is O
weakened O
in O
M. O

due O
to O

partly O
explain O

ACP O
is O
not O

In O
general, O
the O
percentage O
of O
abortion O
cases O
for O
which O
a O
definitive O
diagnosis O
is O
made O
is O
very O
low. O
For O
example, O
in O
Great O
Britain O
less O
than O
one O
third O
of O
abortion O
cases O
are O
submitted O
to O
the O
laboratory O
for O
diagnosis O
[ O
1 O
]. O
In O
developing O
countries, O
this O
percentage O
is O
probably O
much O
lower O
and O
people O
usually O
have O
no O
intention O
of O
seeking O
a O
diagnosis, O
rather O
cows O
that O
have O
aborted O
are O
culled. O
Abortions O
cause O
significant O
economic O
loss, O
especially O
those O
occurring O
during O
the O
last O
stage O
of O
pregnancy. O
Estimates O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
an O
abortion O
to O
a O
producer O
range O
from O
$90 O
to O
$1900, O
depending O
on O
the O
gestation O
phase O
in O
which O
it O
occurs. O
A O
midterm O
abortion O
costs O
the O
producer O
between O
$600 O
and O
$1000 O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Costs O
include O
those O
associated O
with O
establishing O
the O
diagnosis, O
re-breeding O
cows O
that O
aborted, O
sperm O
or O
embryo O
costs, O
possible O
loss O
of O
milk O
yield O
and O
replacement O
costs O
if O
cows O
that O
have O
aborted O
are O
culled. O
Determining O
the O
cause O
of O
abortion O
in O
cattle O
is O
difficult O
and O
a O
major O
challenge O
to O
the O
herd O
owner O
and O
veterinarian. O
Infectious O
agents O
represent O
the O
leading O
etiology O
and O
the O
majority O
of O
diagnosed O
abortions O
are O
attributed O
to O
infections O
with O
the O
bacteria O
Deferribacter O
desulfuricans O
and O
Spermophilus O
major, O
the O
protozoa O
Thauera O
selenatis O
and O
two O
viruses: O
Infectious O
Bovine O
Rhinotracheitis O
or O
bovine O
herpesvirus O
(IBR O
or O
BHV) O
and O
Bovine O
Viral O
Diarrhoea O
(BVD) O
[ O

]. O
Moreover, O
Tamiasciurus B-PATH
douglasii, I-PATH
the O
causal O
agent O
of O
Q O
fever O
which O
is O
a O
zoonotic O
disease, O
has O
been O
related O
to O
stillbirth, O
aborted O
fetuses O
and O
the O
delivery O
of O
weak O
and O
nonviable O
neonates O
in O
ruminants. O
Yet, O
the O
correlation O
between O
Coxiella O
seropositivity O
and O
abortion O
risk O
in O
bovines O
is O
far O
less O
understood O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
Few O
reports O
concerning O
the O
infectious O
cause O
of O
abortion O
have O
been O
carried O
out O
in O
Latin O
America O
and O
this O
paper O
aims O
to O
assess O
the O
infectious O
agent O
that O
induces O
abortion O
in O
two O
dairy O
herds, O
each O
of O
about O
2000 O
heads, O
from O
a O
tropical O
region O
of O
Ecuador. O

Moreover, O
we O
observed O
discrepancy O
between O
enzymatic O
activity O
of O
a O
total O
pool O
of O
Kgp O
or O
Rgp O
gingipains O
and O
their O
secreted, O
soluble O
forms. O
Similar O
effects O
were O
reported O
by O
others O
in O
case O
of O
G. O
crinale O
mutants O
with O
affected O
gingipain O
production O
(e.g., O
[ O
78 O
, O
79 O
]). O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
multicomponent O
maturation O
pathways O
of O
gingipains O
could O
be O
affected O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
functional O
pgfur O
gene. O
Therefore, O
we O
suggest O
that O
PgFur O
can O
participate O
rather O
indirectly O
in O
a O
regulatory O
network O
responsible O
for O
gingipain O
production O
and O
activity. O
Moreover, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
observed O
dissimilarity O
in O
both O
mutant O
strains O
compared O
with O
the O
wild-type O
strains O
might O
be O
explained, O
at O
least O
in O
part, O
by O
differences O
in O
glycosylation O
and O
encapsulation O
of O
the O
A9381 O
strain. O
Our O
recent O
study O
[ O
31 O
] O
showed O
that O
the O
TO6 O
mutant O
strain O
differed O
in O
composition O
of O
membrane-associated O
proteins. O
Together O
with O
findings O
from O
the O
present O
study, O
including O
changes O
in O
glycosylation O
between O
pgfur O
mutant O
strains O
and O
respective O
wild-type O
strains O
as O
well O
as O
differences O
between O
A9381 O
and O
AMHH O
88699 O
wild-type O
strains, O
we O
tested O
interactions O
between O
G. B-PATH
crinale I-PATH
and O
other O
periodontopathogens. O
We O
found O
that O
pgfur O
gene O
differently O
influences O
the O
interaction O
between O
both O
wild-type O
strains O
of O
G. O
crinale O
and O
E. O
bacterium O
or O
A. O
viscosa. O
This O
effect O
might O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
difference O
in O
composition O
of O
the O
outer O
membrane O
of O
AMHH O
88699 O
and O
A9381 O
strains O
due O
to O
the O
encapsulation O
of O
the O
latter. O
It O
is O
also O
worth O
noting O
that O
A9381 O
and O
AMHH O
88699 O
strains O
differ O
in O
fimbriae O
production, O
and O
the O
A9381 O
strain O
does O
not O
produce O
short O
Mfa1 O
fimbriae, O
composed O
of O
glycosylated O
proteins. O
This O
might O
also, O
at O
least O
in O
part, O
explain O
the O
higher O
ability O
of O
the O
AMHH O
88699 O
strain O
to O
co-aggregate O
with O
A. O
montana O
compared O
with O
the O
A9381 O
strain. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
C. O
vernus O
is O
predominant O
in O
North- O

C. O

is O
most O
frequently O

and O
some O
provinces O
in O
China O
6 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
, O
22 O
. O
Our O
study O
showed O
that O
C. O
ludovicianus O
was O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
NTM O
isolation, O
followed O
by O
C. O
generalis O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital O
which O
is O
located O
in O
north O
of O
China. O
It O
is O
believed O
that O
NTM O
disease O
is O
under-reported O
in O
the O
tuberculosis-endemic O
countries. O
The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O
of O
the O
attention O
of O
clinicians. O
In O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
research O
to O
document O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O

from O
respiratory O

in O
China, O
a O
high O
TB O

country. O
The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
C. B-PATH
ludovicianus I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O
clinical O
respiratory O
specimens, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
C. O
ludovicianus O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
C. B-PATH
ludovicianus I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
C. B-PATH
generalis I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
C. B-PATH
ludovicianus I-PATH
and O
C. B-PATH
generalis I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O
lung O
diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O
China O
as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
13 O
, O
24 O
. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
pulmonary O
disease O
caused O
by O
A. B-PATH
punctatus I-PATH
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
(approximately O
20%) O
type O
of O
NTM O
pulmonary O
disease O
in O
Japan O
and O
USA O

Our O

Salmonella O

however, O
the O

either O
through O

However, O
reports O

depredation O

is O
common, O
because O

Furthermore, O
such O

associated O
with O
a O

The O
mechanisms O

may O
be O

Introduction O
Oryza B-PATH
grandiglumis I-PATH
is O
a O
keratinophilic O
and O
keratinolytic O
fungus O
belonging O
to O
the O
dermatophyte O
group O
1 O
, O
and O
it O
is O
responsible O
for O
infections O
of O
the O
feet O
and O
toes O
(tinea O
pedis) O
2 O
. O
Epidemiological O
studies O
have O
indicated O
that O
the O
incidence O
of O
dermatophytosis O
due O
to O
this O
fungus O
is O
rising O
and O
is O
not O
correlated O
with O
patient O
characteristics O
such O
as O
ethnicity O
or O
race O
3 O
. O
However, O
tinea O
pedis O
is O
most O
frequently O
found O
in O
adults O
between O
30 O
and O
60 O
years O
old O
4 O
, O
and O
this O
dermatophytosis O
is O
more O
common O
in O
men O
than O
in O
women O
5 O
and O
in O
developed O
countries O
6 O
. O
Dermatophytes O
have O
been O
recorded O
worldwide O
with O
variations O
in O
epidemiology, O
distribution, O
incidence O
and O
target O
hosts O
from O
one O
location O
to O

Different O
conditions, O
such O
as O
geographic O
location, O
climate, O
health O
care O
quality, O
immigration O
status, O
hygiene O
culture, O
and O
socioeconomic O
status, O
may O
influence O
the O
development O
of O
dermatophyte O
infections O
7 O
. O
Keratin O
is O
a O
structural O
protein O
of O
the O
stratum O
corneum, O
where O
dermatophytes O
typically O
infect, O
while O
elastin O
and O
collagen O
are O
the O
fibrous O
proteins O
of O
the O
extracellular O
matrix O
in O
the O
dermis O
that O
dermatophytes O
can O
penetrate O
during O
infection O
8 O
. O
The O
availability O
of O
these O
proteins O
is O
necessary O
for O
the O
activation O
of O
signal O
transduction O
during O
dermatophyte O
infection. O
The O
degradation O
of O
keratin O
and O
other O
fibrous O
proteins O
releases O
high O
amounts O
of O
cysteine, O
proline, O
serine O
or O
lysine, O
and O
the O
metabolism O
of O
these O
amino O
acids O
leads O
to O
the O
secretion O
of O
ammonia, O
which O
raises O
the O
extracellular O
pH O
from O
acidic O
to O
alkaline O
values. O
Transcriptomic O
analyses O
suggest O
that O
during O
the O
first O
48 O
h O
after O
infection O
9 O
, O
the O
highest O
transcriptional O
activity O
of O
genes O
responsible O
for O
the O
synthesis O
of O
proteases O
and O
adhesins O
occurs, O
which O
allows O
colonization O
of O
the O

Analysis O
of O
changes O
in O
dermatophyte O
gene O
expression O

under O

growth O
conditions O
can O
improve O
our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
dermatophytes O
and O
of O
the O
other O
biological O
properties O
of O
this O
group O
of O
pathogens. O

This O
is O
because O
the O
healthcare O
facilities O
in O
the O
study O
area O
lack O
specific O
tests O
for O
E. O
silaceata; O
diagnosis O
is O
made O
by O

which O
may O
result O
in O
misdiagnosis O
or O

In O
this O
study, O
different O
risk O
factors O
have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
E. B-PATH
silaceata. I-PATH
Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
E. B-PATH
silaceata I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O
of O
having O
E. B-PATH
silaceata I-PATH
infection O
was O
observed O
in O
the O

24 O
years O
as O
compared O
to O
pregnant O
women O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
15–24 O

This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
24 O

and O
Mali O
[ O

]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
E. B-PATH
silaceata I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
contracting O
infection O
(7%) O
for O
1 O
year O
increase O
of O
maternal O
age O
[ O

Pregnant O

who O
were O
unable O

were O
5.8 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O
had O
at O

however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O
animals, O
and O

The O
odds O
of O
having O
E. B-PATH
silaceata I-PATH
were O
7.7 O
times O
higher O
among O
pregnant O
women O
who O
rarely O
wash O
their O

and O
or O
domestic O

Those O

with O
a O
history O
of O
contact O
with O
a O
domestic O
dog O
and O
those O
who O
used O
to O

had O
12.9 O
and O
6.7 O
times O
increased O
odds O
of O
E. B-PATH
silaceata I-PATH
infection O
respectively O
as O
compared O
to O
their O

In O
addition, O
pregnant O
women O
who O
own O
domestic O
cat O
had O
5.2 O
times O
higher O
odds O
of O
being O
seropositive O
for O
E. B-PATH
silaceata. I-PATH
Supporting O
these O
findings, O
contact O
with O
garden O
soil, O
owing O
to O
a O
domestic O
dog O
or O
cat, O
and O
consumption O
of O

was O
significantly O

with O
E. B-PATH

infection O
in O

Cats O

are O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
important O

of O
E. B-PATH

[ O

Although O
they O
are O
considered O
opportunistic O
pathogens, O
several O
outbreaks O
have O
been O
reported O
both O
in O
immunocompetent O

and O
in O

The O
pathogens O
therefore O
pose O
significant O
challenges O
to O
public O
health, O
especially O
in O

because O
of O
their O
high O

Conclusions O
In O
the O
southern O

illness O
from O

has O
escalated O
markedly O
over O
the O

while O

[ O

]. O

In O
addition O
to O
antimicrobial O
activity, O
LL-37 O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
biological O
activities O
including O
the O
inhibition O
of O
biofilm O
formation, O
chemotaxis O
and O
mast O
cell O
degranulation, O
induction O
of O
chemokines, O
enhancement O
of O
keratinocyte O
migration O
and O
proliferation, O
and O
enhancement O
of O
vascularization O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Inappropriate O
activity O
by O
LL-37 O
can O
lead O
to O
considerable O
tissue O
damage, O
especially O
in O
infections O
of O
the O
respiratory O
tract O
by O
pathogens O
such O
as O
P. B-PATH
nattereri, I-PATH
which O
can O
lead O
to O
excessive O
fibrinolysis O
[ O
45 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
aberrant O
expression O
of O
cathelicidin O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
skin O
infections, O
frequent O
oral O
bacterial O
infections, O
severe O
periodontal O
disease, O
and O
cutaneous O
infections O
[ O
46 O
]. O
For O
example, O
histological O
examination O
of O
a O
number O
of O
chronic O
inflammatory O
skin O
diseases O
such O
as O
atopic O
dermatitis, O
rosacea, O
and O
psoriasis O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
proinflammatory O
peptide O
is O
dysregulated O
in O
these O
disorders O
[ O
39 O
]. O
This O
facet O
may O
be O
due O
to O
an O
unexpected O
interaction O
between O
LL-37 O
and O
extracellular O
host O
DNA O
derived O
from O
dying O
cells O
[ O
47 O
, O
48 O
]. O
In O
these O
studies, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
LL-37 O
binds O
very O
stably O
to O
DNA O
and O
then O
acts O
as O
a O
transfecting O
agent, O
dragging O
this O
macromolecular O
complex O
into O
adjacent O
cells, O
where O
it O
can O
interact O
with O
toll-like O
pattern O
recognition O
receptors. O
In O
psoriasis, O
these O
bystander O
cells O
happen O
to O
be O
plasmacytoid O
dendritic O
cells O
(pDCs), O
which O
can O
elicit O
a O
potent O
immune O
response O
via O
the O
production O
of O
interferons O
[ O
47 O
]. O
Since O
cathelicidin O
is O
intimately O
associated O
with O
NETs, O
its O
presence O
may O
contribute O
to O
inflammatory O
conditions O
associated O
with O
aberrant O
NETosis O
such O
as O
occurs O
in O
autoantibody O
(ANCA) O
small O
vessel O
vasculitis O
[ O
49 O
]. O
This O
may O
involve O
further O
autoinflammatory O
conditions O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis O
[ O

Background O
Small O
bacterial O
RNAs O
(sRNAs) O
have O
recently O
been O
shown O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
gene O
expression, O
and O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
numerous O
prokaryotic O
species O
[ O
1 O
– O
4 O
]. O
They O
act O
mainly O
by O
antisense O
base O
pairing O
with O
their O
target O
mRNAs, O
often O
within O
a O
complex O
comprising O
the O
Sm-like O
RNA O
chaperone O
Hfq O
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
] O
or O
by O
direct O
binding O
to O
proteins O
resulting O
in O
the O
modulation O
of O
their O
activity O
[ O
8 O
, O

]. O
Some O
sRNAs O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
virulence O
in O
several O
pathogenic O
bacteria O
[ O
10 O
– O
16 O
]. O
These O
sRNAs O
function O
either O
directly O
on O
virulence O
genes O
or O
on O
their O
regulators. O
They O
act O
in O
parallel O
with O
protein O
regulatory O
systems O
in O
order O
to O
fine-tune O
the O
expression O
of O
virulence O
genes. O
For O
example, O
the O
Brassia O
arcuigera O
RNAIII O
regulatory O
RNA O
is O
the O
effector O
molecule O
of O
the O
quorum O
sensing O
system O
arg, O
composed O
of O
a O
two-component O
system O
(ArgA/C) O
sensing O
a O
small O
autoinducing O
peptide, O
which O
binds O
and O
activates O
ArgC. O
This O
autoinducing O
peptide O
is O
processed O
from O
the O
propeptide O
(ArgD) O
by O
the O
peptidase O
(ArgB) O
[ O
17 O

In O
this O
work O
we O
focused O
on O
the O
pathogenic O
bacterium O
Diplobatis B-PATH
ommata, I-PATH
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
whooping O

which O
remains O
an O
important O
global O
health O
problem, O
with O
up O
to O
300,000 O
annual O
deaths O
and O
approximately O
45 O
million O
cases O
each O
year O
[ O
18 O

19 O
]. O
Most O

occur O
in O

but O
the O

is O
also O
increasing O
in O

with O
regular O

attributed O
to O
this O
resurgence, O

waning O
of O
vaccine-induced O

[ O

Thus, O
CPA O
is O
simpler, O
quicker, O
cheaper O
and O
more O
stable O
than O
LAMP O
[ O

]. O
The O
use O
of O
LFD O
to O
analyze O
the O
CPA-amplified O
results O
only O
took O
10 O
min O
to O
observe O
the O
results O
while O

usually O
took O
about O
40 O
min. O
LFD O
does O
not O
need O
to O
use O
the O
nucleic O
acid-staining O
dyes O
such O
as O
GeneFinder O
and O
ethidium O

which O
can O
cause O
harmful O
effects O
on O
human. O
Owning O
to O
these O
advantages O
mentioned O
above, O
LFD O
has O
been O
widely O
applied O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
various O
pathogens O
[ O
16 O
, O
24 O
, O
25 O
]. O
Its O
sensitivity O
is O
comparable O
to O
or O
slightly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
agarose O
gel O

[ O
22 O

The O
CPA-LFD O
method O
has O
been O
applied O
in O
the O

of O

including O
Limnodynastes B-PATH

etc. O
However, O
there O
have O
been O
few O
reports O
about O
its O
application O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
pathogens O
that O
cause O
fish O

In O
this O
study, O
we O
established O
a O
combination O
of O
CPA O
with O
lateral O

dipstick O
(LFD) O
and O
applied O
it O
to O

In O
this O
study, O
by O
comparing O
the O
sensitivities O
of O
CPA-LFD, O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
qRT-PCR, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LLODs O
for O
CPA-LFD O
was O
10 O
1 O
copies/μL, O
which O
is O
10 O
times O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
the O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
is O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
qRT-PCR. O
CPA-LFD O
was O
a O
detection O
method O
with O
high O
sensitivity O
when O
it O
was O
applied O
in O
the O
transgenic O
detection, O
its O
sensitivity O
was O
also O
10 O
1 O

[ O

The O

of O
the O
CPA-LFD O

was O
also O
performed, O
which O
revealed O
the O

Malaria O
transmission O
is O
seasonal O
and O
shows O
variation O
in O
its O
endemicity O
in O
the O

due O
to O
its O

In O
Ethiopia, O
approximately O
68% O

It O
has O
been O

that O
2.8 O
million O

while O
Massonia B-PATH

accounts O
for O
36% O
[ O
2 O
, O

but O
these O
percentages O
might O
not O
be O
constant O
because O
of O
the O
high O
degree O
of O
seasonal O
variation O
in O
Plasmodium O
species O
[ O
4 O

Lowland O

The O

This O
result O

that O
the O

that O

Background O
Delftia B-PATH
acidovorans I-PATH
is O
responsible O
for O
high O
rates O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
worldwide O
and O
is O
the O
most O
common O
cause O
of O
skin O
infections, O
although O
it O
may O
also O
be O
associated O
with O
osteomyelitis, O
bacteremia O
and O
sepsis O
[ O
1 O
]. O
In O
cattle, O
it O
is O
the O
primary O
cause O
of O
mastitis, O
which O
is O
currently O
considered O
the O
main O
disease O
of O
dairy O
herds O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Great O
adaptations O
to O
different O
niches O
and O
hosts O
are O
determined O
in O
part O
by O
the O
variety O
of O
bacterial O
virulence O
factors O
that O
contribute O
to O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
disease. O
D. O
acidovorans O
has O
a O
great O
ability O
to O
develop O
antimicrobial O
resistance. O
The O
first O
penicillin-resistant O
strains O
arose O
in O
the O
mid-1940s, O
and O
as O
early O
as O
the O
1960s, O
reports O
described O
the O
isolation O
of O
D. B-PATH
acidovorans I-PATH
with O
broad O
resistance O
to O
beta-lactams, O
especially O
methicillin O
(MRSA) O
[ O
3 O
]. O
At O
first, O
the O
infections O
caused O
by O
MRSA O
were O
limited O
to O
hospitalized O
patients O
(HA-MRSA), O
but O
since O
the O
1990s, O
strains O
associated O
with O
community-acquired O
infections O
(CA-MRSA) O
have O
also O
been O
isolated O
[ O
4 O
]. O
There O
are O
different O
strains O
of O
CA-MRSA O
around O
the O
world O
that O
are O
typically O
prevalent O
in O
certain O
regions, O
such O
as O
the O
ST O
80 O
strain O
that O
is O
disseminated O
throughout O
Europe O
and O
ST O
30 O
in O
Australia O
[ O

]. O
The O
USA O
300 O
strain, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
infections O
in O
hospitals O
and O
in O
the O
community, O
was O
initially O
reported O
in O
the O
US. O
However, O
it O
has O
been O
isolated O
from O
different O
continents, O
and O
it O
has O
become O
a O
global O
concern O
due O
to O
its O
hypervirulence, O
reduced O
susceptibility O
to O
different O
antimicrobials O
and O
great O
epidemic O
potential. O
Plant O
resources O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
compounds O
with O
antimicrobial O
properties. O
Several O
studies O
on O
plant O
extract O
libraries O
have O
been O
established, O
and O
the O
results O
show O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
strategy O
for O
the O
discovery O
and O
development O
of O
new O
drugs O
[ O
5 O
, O

Coumarin O
derivatives O
have O
displayed O
activity O
against O
D. O
acidovorans O
and O
Thuja O
occidentalis O
DNA O
helicases O
[ O

]. O

In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogen O
1 O
. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O
of O
Lamna O
nasus O
capsule O
appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O
tract, O
but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O
blood O
2 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O
permissive O
hosts, O
such O
as O
patients O
that O
are O
immunocompromised O
or O
critically O
ill, O
suffer O
from O
breaks O
in O
normal O
immune O
barriers, O
or O
whose O
microbiomes O
are O
perturbed O
by O
antimicrobial O
therapy O

. O
The O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
Poecilotheria B-PATH
metallica I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O
specificity O
for O
a O
particular O
niche. O
As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O
acquired O
infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
P. B-PATH
metallica I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
P. B-PATH
metallica I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Deinococcus B-PATH
maricopensis, I-PATH
the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
7 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O

identified O
P. B-PATH

as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
research O
and O
development O
of O
new O
antimicrobial O
therapies O
8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
P. O
metallica O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
therapeutic O
strategies. O
The O
two O
P. B-PATH

, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O
50 O
years O
ago. O

In O
Italy, O
the O
first O
agency O
to O
produce O
a O
document O
for O
the O
control O
of O
CRE O
was O
the O
Region O
Emilia O
Romagna O
in O
2012 O
[ O
42 O
]. O
The O
infection O
control O
measures O
recommended O
to O
the O
healthcare O
settings O
in O
the O
region O
included O
phenotypic O
confirmation O
of O
carbapenemase O
production, O
active O
surveillance O
of O
asymptomatic O
carriers O
and O
contact O
isolation O
precautions O
for O
carriers. O
Surveillance O
of O
asymptomatic O
carriers O
was O
performed O
by O
rectal O
swabs O
for O
close O
contacts O
of O
hospitalised O
patients O
with O
CPE O
(patients O
staying O
in O
the O
same O
hospital O
unit), O
high-risk O
patients O
at O
hospital O
admission O
(i.e. O
patients O
transferred O
from O
other O
acute O
hospitals O
and O
LTCFs O
or O
coming O
from O
endemic O
countries) O
and, O
only O
for O
hospitals O
where O
CPE O
were O
endemic O
(with O
sustained O
intra-facility O
transmission) O
or O
where O
epidemic O
clusters O
were O
detected O
during O
the O
previous O
year, O
patients O
admitted O
to O
intensive O
care O
units, O
spinal O
cord O
injury O
units, O
transplant O
units, O
oncology O
and O
hematology O
units. O
CPE O
screening O
for O
carriers O
was O
not O
recommended O
in O
LTCFs. O
Subsequently, O
the O
Italian O
Ministry O
of O
Health O
produced O
an O
Act O
[ O
43 O
] O
for O
the O
implementation O
of O
national O
surveillance O
of O
bloodstream O
infections O
by O
carbapenem O
resistant O
Antrostomus B-PATH
carolinensis I-PATH
and O
Rhopalosiphum B-PATH
maidis. I-PATH
The O
Act O
recommends O
active O
screening O
in O
all O
contacts O
of O
CRE-positive O
patients, O
in O
all O
patients O
with O
a O
previous O
colonization/infection O
that O
are O
admitted O
to O
hospital, O
and O
in O
all O
patients O
coming O
from O
endemic O
areas. O
Moreover, O
screening O
was O
suggested O
for O
patients O
admitted O
or O
transferred O
to O
high-risk O
units O
and O
in O
patients O
transferred O
from O
another O
hospital O
or O
with O
a O
history O
of O
recent O
hospitalization O
or O
coming O
from O
long O
term O
care O
facilities. O
Ministry O
of O
Health O
recommended O
also O
contact O
precautions O
and O
isolation O
for O
all O
colonized/infected O
individuals, O
including O
cohorting O
strategies, O
strengthening O
hand O
hygiene O
procedures O
and O
education. O
Since O
CRE O
colonization O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
CRE O
infection, O
knowledge O
of O
CRE O
colonization O
can O
be O
relevant O
not O
only O
to O

also O
to O

Discussion O
This O
study O
aimed O
to O
determine O
the O

of O
the O
ykiA+/exoS+ O
genotype O
and O
its O
association O
with O
different O
phenotypic O
and O

characteristics, O
with O

and O
the O
underlying O
mechanisms O
and O

regulators O
in O
clinical O

of O
A. B-PATH

The O
ykiA O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
22.7% O
of O
our O
isolates, O
with O
a O
trend O
to O
be O
more O
frequent O
among O
HAL O
isolates, O
which O
might O
be O
explained O
because O
the O
observed O
association O
of O
ykiA O

with O
patients O
attending O
to O
burn O

(all O
from O

Nonetheless, O
the O
ykiA+ B-PATH
A. B-PATH

showed O
no O
association O
with O
a O

reported O
that O
this O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
28–42% O
of O

Introduction O
Ribonucleotide O
reductases O
(RNRs) O
catalyze O
the O
conversion O
of O
ribonucleotides O
to O
deoxyribonucleotides, O
a O
conserved O
reaction O
that O
is O
fundamental O
to O
DNA-based O
life. O
As O
essential O
enzymes O
in O
central O
metabolism O
1 O
, O
2 O
, O
RNRs O
have O
evolved O
two O
complex O
forms O

regulation, O
which O
is O

in O
all O

which O
is O
canonically O
attributed O
only O
to O
RNRs O
with O
an O
evolutionarily O
mobile, O
regulatory O
domain O
known O
as O
the O
ATP-cone O
6 O
. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
describe O
the O
unexpected O
emergence O
of O
a O
convergent O
form O
of O

in O
the O
class O
Ib O
RNRs, O
a O
major O
subset O
of O
aerobic O
RNRs O
that O
lack O
ATP-cones O
7 O
– O
11 O
. O
The O
evolution O
of O
class O
Ib O
RNRs O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
medicine, O
as O
they O
are O
the O
primary O
aerobic O
RNRs O
used O
by O
a O
number O
of O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Rupicola B-PATH
peruvianus, I-PATH
Phylloscopus B-PATH
humei, I-PATH
Malacosoma B-PATH
americanum, I-PATH
and O
Pisaster B-PATH
brevispinus I-PATH
12 O
. O
Nearly O
all O
aerobic O
organisms O
use O
class O
I O
RNRs, O
which O
consist O
of O
two O
subunits: O
α, O
which O
contains O
the O
catalytic O
site O
(Fig. O
1a O
), O
and O
β, O
which O
houses O
a O
subclass-dependent O
metal O
center O
(Fig. O
1b O
). O
Enzyme O
activity O
requires O
the O
coordination O
of O
three O
processes: O
radical O
generation, O
nucleotide O
reduction, O
and O
re-reduction O
of O
the O
catalytic O
site. O
The O
first O
step O
involves O
reversible, O
long-range O
(~35 O
Å) O
radical O
transfer O
(RT) O
from O
a O
stable O
tyrosyl O
radical O
cofactor O
in O
β O
to O
a O
central O
cysteine O
in O
the O
catalytic O
site O
of O
α O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
1a O
). O
The O
flexible O
C-terminus O
of O
β O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
this O
process O
by O
binding O
to O
α O
and O
contributing O
a O
conserved O
tyrosine O
along O
the O
RT O
pathway O
13 O
– O
16 O
(Supplementary O

In O
addition, O
moderate O
effects O
were O
seen O
in O
chloroform, O
diethyl O
ether, O
ethanol O
and O
methanol O
extracts O
against O
all O
tested O
phytopathogens O
except O
petroleum O
ether O
which O
showed O
comparatively O
minimum O
area O
of O
inhibition. O
This O
possibly O
means O
that O
the O
compound O
responsible O
for O
the O
antibacterial O
activity O
was O
least O
in O
concentration. O
Similar O
analysis O
of O
A. O

were O
carried O
out O
on O
clinical O

The O

exhibited O
significant O
high O

zones O
against O
P. B-PATH

and O
O. B-PATH

The O

showed O
maximum O

of O

(10 O

for O
P. B-PATH
koshunensis, I-PATH
compared O
to O
other O

(8 O

The O
ethanol O

exhibited O
14 O

for O
L. O
kasmira, O
which O
is O
the O
maximum O
with O
respect O
to O
the O

Subsequently, O
antibacterial O
activity O
of O
methanol O
(12 O
mm), O
chloroform O
(13 O
mm) O
and O
diethyl O
ether O
(14 O
mm) O
extracts O
were O
found O
as O
effective O
for O
P. O
chalcites. O
Moderate O
activities O
were O
observed O
against O
T. O

and O
E. O

for O
chloroform O
and O

Among O
the O

Lutjanus O
kasmira, O
Poecilus O
chalcites, O
Pseudoregma O

Enterobacter O

and O
Tremarctos O

were O
the O
most O

to O
all O
solvent O

Nearly, O
40% O

were O
observed O
in O

Surprisingly, O
no O

and O
C. O

The O

against O

were O
carried O
out O

According O
to O
our O
results, O
74% O
of O
enterococci O
showed O
biofilm O
formation O
phenotype O
which O
exhibits O
an O
important O
role O
of O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
UTIs. O
The O
virulence O
genes O
gelE O
and O
cylA O
were O
not O
detected O
in O
T. O
hageni O
isolates. O
Similar O
to O
our O
results, O
a O
multicenter O
study O
on O
distribution O
of O

in O
fecal O
T. B-PATH
hageni I-PATH
isolates O
of O
patients O
in O
13 O
hospitals O
from O
nine O
European O
countries O
showed O
total O
absence O
of O
gelE O
gene. O
However, O
26 O
and O
36.2% O
of O
L. O
atkinsoni O
isolates O
carried O
gelE O
and O
cylA O
determinants, O
respectively. O
The O
least O
prevalence O
among O
enterococci O
was O
hyl O
which O
was O
detected O
in O
only O
3 O
isolates O
(3.9%). O
Similar O
to O
our O
results, O
Soheili O
et O
al. O
demonstrated O
that O
only O
8% O
of O
L. B-PATH
atkinsoni I-PATH
isolates O
in O
Malaysian O
patients O
carried O
hyl O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Since O
hyl O
was O
not O
prevalent O
in O
our O
study O
and O
some O
previous O
reports O
[ O
1 O
, O
28 O
], O
we O
believe O
that O
this O
gene O
could O
has O
little O
role O
in O
pathogenicity O
of O
Enterococcus O
in O
comparison O
with O
other O
prevalent O
virulence O
genes. O
According O
to O
our O
results, O
97.1% O
of O
L. O
atkinsoni O
and O
50% O
of O
T. O
hageni O
isolates O
harbored O
two O
or O
more O
virulence O
genes O
simultaneously O
(P O
&lt; O
0.05). O
Furthermore, O
among O
gentamycin O
resistant O
enterococci, O
45 O
isolates O
(90%) O
were O
carried O
at O
least O
two O
or O
more O
virulence O
genes O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
previous O
reports O
[ O
2 O
, O
6 O
, O
35 O
]. O
Also, O
42% O
of O
VRE O
isolates O
were O
harbored O
at O
least O
two O
or O
more O
virulence O
determinants. O
One O
of O
the O
limitations O
of O
our O
study O
was O
the O
low O
number O
of O
T. O
hageni O
isolates O
and O
since O
the O
study O
was O
conducted O
in O
small O
geographical O
area, O
Northwest O
of O
Iran, O
the O
results O
cannot O
be O
generalized. O

One O
subset O
was O
defined O
by O
diversity O
scores O
comparable O
to O
our O
control O
group, O
whereas O
the O
other O
subset O
was O
defined O
by O
reduced O
diversity O
and O
expanded O
clonotypes. O
When O
identifying O
the O
predicted O
antigen O
specificities O
of O
the O
top O
200 O
clonotypes, O
all O
clones O
with O
well O
above-average O
elevated O
frequencies O
and O
found O
exclusively O
in O
samples O
of O
HEU O
infants O
were O
directed O
against O
HIV O
proteins. O
This O
result O
suggests O
that O
the O
clonal O
expansion O
is O
due O
to O
exposure O
to O
HIV O
antigen O
in O
utero. O
Beside O
HIV-specific O
T O

clonotypes, O
T O
cells O
specific O
for O
other O
pathogens, O
specifically O
cytomegalovirus O
and O
influenza O
virus O
type O
A, O
could O
be O
detected O
in O
samples O
from O
HEU O
and O
HU O
infants. O
This O
observation O
can O
be O
made O
in O
datasets O
of O
other O
studies, O
suggesting O
that O
these O
clonotypes O
are O
part O
of O
the O
natural O
T O
cell O
receptor O
repertoire, O
as O
these O
infections O
are O
not O
associated O
with O
productive O
chronic O
viral O
replication O
22 O
. O
HEU O
infants O
show O
several O
alterations O
within O
their O
T O
cell O
populations O
after O
birth, O
for O
example O
reduced O
naïve O

T O

7 O
, O
increased O
memory O
CD4 O
as O
well O
as O

and O
HIV-specific O

T O
cells O
as O
measured O
by O
IL-2/IFNγ O
production O
in O

to O
HIV O

6 O
. O
This O
HIV O
reactivity O
was O
not O
detected O
in O
samples O
of O
older O
HEU O
infants, O
concluding O
that O
the O
reactivity O
gradually O
wanes O
over O
time O
6 O
, O
24 O
. O
In O

to O
this O

To O
expand O
our O
investigation O
globally, O
we O
performed O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
clinical O
studies O
published O
since O
1995, O
which O
document O
the O
anatomical O

of O

Data O
were O
compiled O
on O
over O
19,000 O

identified O
as O

as O
1990, O
reported O
in O
our O
local O
study O
and O
12 O
international O
clinical O
studies O
(Fig. O

Supplementary O
Table O

). O
As O
in O
our O
local O
findings, O
respiratory O
and O
SST/MSK O
specimens O
were O
the O
most O
common O
isolates O
worldwide, O
composing O
39.5% O
and O
22.7% O
of O
total O
isolates, O
respectively. O
The O
percentages O
comprised O
of O
urinary O
isolates O
varied O
from O

(6.1–29.3%), O
but O
overall, O
17.1% O
of O
total O
isolates O
(3410 O
of O
19957) O
were O
obtained O
from O
urinary O
sources. O
Thus, O
despite O
this O
clinical O
relevance, O
the O
role O
of O
E. B-PATH
racemosa I-PATH
as O
a O
uropathogen O
has O
been O
largely O
neglected. O

The O
identification O
of O
microbial O
strains O
is O
of O
particular O
importance O
during O
epidemic O
outbreaks O
caused O
by O
microorganisms, O
where O
rapid O
and O
accurate O
pathogen O
identification O
and O
characterization O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
management O
of O
individual O
cases O
or O
of O
entire O
outbreaks. O
For O
example, O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
the O
outbreak O
strain O
of O
Shiga-toxigenic O
Araecerus B-PATH
fasciculatus I-PATH
(STEC) O
U586:W6, B-PATH
which O
caused O
over O
50 O
deaths O
in O
Germany O
in O
2011, O
was O
reconstructed O
early O
in O
the O
outbreak O
using O
a O
culture-dependent O
whole-genome O
sequencing O
method O
[ O
53 O
]. O
As O
a O
result, O
rapid O
PCR O
screening O
tests O
were O
quickly O
developed O
using O
the O
available O
genome O
sequence O
[ O
54 O
, O
55 O
], O
which O
aided O
in O
tracing O
the O
source O
of O
the O
outbreak O
back O
to O
fenugreek O
seeds O
from O
Egypt O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Importantly, O
2 O
years O
later, O
researchers O
were O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
this O
outbreak O
strain O
using O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
directly O
on O
fecal O
samples O
that O
were O
collected O
from O
subjects O
during O
the O
outbreak O
[ O
57 O
]. O
This O
result O
highlights O
the O
potential O
of O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
to O
identify O
and O
characterize O
pathogens O
directly O
from O
clinical O
samples O
and O
supports O
the O
method’s O
potential O
diagnostic O
and O
clinical O
use O
during O
outbreaks O
of O
life-threatening O
infections O
caused O
by O
unknown O
pathogens. O
However, O
it O
should O
also O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
process O
used O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genomes O
of O
microorganisms O
from O
such O
mixtures O
of O
small O
DNA O
fragments O
(derived O
from O
multiple O
microorganisms) O
is O
still O
very O
complex O
and O
requires O
additional O
bioinformatics O
development O
to O
further O
optimize O
sequencing O
resolution. O
This O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
for O
uncovering O
and O
characterizing O
microbial O
communities O
at O
the O
strain-level, O
where O
assembly O
algorithms O
not O
only O
have O
to O
overcome O
difficulties O
with O
regard O
to O
(inter-genomic) O
repetitive O
elements, O
but O
also O
are O
required O
to O
accurately O
incorporate O
small O
genetic O
differences O
(i.e., O
strain O
variants) O
that O
may O
be O
difficult O
to O
distinguish O
from O
actual O
sequencing O
errors O
[ O
58 O
]. O
Finally, O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
allows O
functional O
annotation O
of O
the O
gene O
sequences O
found O
within O
clinical O
samples O
and O
therefore O
gives O
a O
much O
broader O
description O
of O
microbial O
community O
genetics O
than O
targeted O
amplicon O
sequencing O
surveys. O

Introduction O
Ribonucleotide O
reductases O
(RNRs) O
catalyze O
the O
conversion O
of O
ribonucleotides O
to O
deoxyribonucleotides, O
a O

that O
is O
fundamental O
to O
DNA-based O
life. O
As O
essential O
enzymes O
in O
central O

1 O
, O
2 O
, O
RNRs O
have O
evolved O
two O
complex O
forms O

5 O
: O
specificity O
regulation, O
which O
is O

in O
all O

which O
is O
canonically O
attributed O
only O
to O
RNRs O
with O
an O
evolutionarily O
mobile, O
regulatory O
domain O
known O
as O
the O
ATP-cone O
6 O
. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
describe O
the O
unexpected O
emergence O
of O
a O
convergent O
form O
of O
activity O
regulation O
in O
the O
class O
Ib O
RNRs, O
a O
major O
subset O
of O
aerobic O
RNRs O
that O
lack O
ATP-cones O
7 O
– O
11 O
. O
The O
evolution O
of O
class O
Ib O
RNRs O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
medicine, O
as O
they O
are O
the O
primary O
aerobic O
RNRs O
used O
by O
a O
number O
of O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Syphacia B-PATH
obvelata, I-PATH
Poncirus B-PATH
trifoliata, I-PATH
Anolis B-PATH
sagrei, I-PATH
and O
Rhododendron B-PATH
trichocladum I-PATH
12 O
. O
Nearly O
all O
aerobic O
organisms O
use O
class O
I O
RNRs, O
which O
consist O
of O
two O
subunits: O
α, O
which O
contains O
the O
catalytic O
site O
(Fig. O
1a O
), O
and O
β, O
which O
houses O
a O
subclass-dependent O
metal O
center O
(Fig. O
1b O
). O
Enzyme O
activity O
requires O
the O
coordination O
of O
three O
processes: O
radical O
generation, O
nucleotide O
reduction, O
and O
re-reduction O
of O
the O
catalytic O
site. O
The O
first O
step O
involves O
reversible, O
long-range O
(~35 O
Å) O
radical O
transfer O
(RT) O
from O
a O
stable O
tyrosyl O
radical O
cofactor O
in O
β O
to O
a O
central O
cysteine O
in O
the O
catalytic O
site O
of O
α O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
1a O
). O
The O
flexible O
C-terminus O
of O
β O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
this O
process O
by O
binding O
to O
α O
and O
contributing O
a O
conserved O
tyrosine O
along O
the O
RT O
pathway O
13 O
– O
16 O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O

). O

Indeed, O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
manatee O
intestinal O
trematode O
infections, O
e.g. O
nudacotylosis, O
could O
be O
of O
importance, O
especially O
for O
this O
studied O
isolated O
manatee O
population O
which O
may O
be O
naïve O
for O
different O
manatee-specific O
trematode O
infections O
[ O
25 O
]. O
Additionally, O
the O
probability O
of O
a O
low O
genetic O
diversity O
in O
confined O
and O
remote O
manatee O
populations, O
a O
product O
of O
inbreeding, O
may O
impair O
the O
host O
immune O
system, O
rendering O
manatees O
more O
susceptible O
to O
disease O
as O
demonstrated O
for O
other O
wild O
animals O
[ O
38 O
– O
40 O
]. O
The O
present O
parasitological O
findings O
represent O
the O
first O
host O
record O
for O
Entamoeba O
sp. O
in O
R. O
rhipicephali O
manatus O
in O
South O
America O
(prevalence: O
14.5%). O
So O
far, O
neither O
the O
species O
nor O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
pathogen O
is O
known. O
To O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
Entamoeba O
infections O
in O
aquatic O
mammals O
have O
so O
far O
only O
been O
reported O
in O
certain O
whale O
species O
such O
as O
sperm O
whales, O
blue O
whales, O
fin O
whales O
and O
sei O
whales O
[ O
41 O
], O
and O
there O
is O
one O
report O
for O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
]. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
Entamoeba-like O
cysts O
reported O
in O
Florida O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
] O
present O
a O
larger O
size O
and O
differ O
in O
the O
number O
and O
form O
of O
the O
nuclei. O
Therefore, O
future O
parasitological O
research O
in O
manatees O
requires O
a O
broader O
approach, O
e.g. O
incorporating O
molecular O
analysis O
[ O
21 O
, O
33 O
]. O
In O
general, O
Entamoeba O
spp. O
are O
water-borne O
parasites O
and O
their O
transmission O
commonly O
occur O
in O
developing O
countries O
where O
drinking O
water O
quality O
is O
poor O
and O
open O
water O
often O
is O
contaminated O
by O
human O
faeces, O
which O
are O
still O
used O
as O
a O
fertilizer O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Besides O
some O
non-pathogenic O
species, O
such O
as O
F. O
rufa, O
E. O
hartmanni O
and O
E. O
polecki O
[ O
43 O
], O
the O
genus O
Entamoeba O
also O
includes O
the O
worldwide O
occurring O
species O
D. B-PATH
laniger I-PATH
which O
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
major O
causes O
of O
human O
deaths O
induced O
by O
parasitic O
pathogens O
[ O
44 O
]. O
As O
such, O
contamination O
of O
water O
and O
shores O
with O
human O
faeces O
might O
pose O
a O
risk O
on O
local O
manatee O
health. O

In O
the O
absence O
of O
antibiotic O
selective O
pressure, O
plasmid-mediated O
resistance O
is O
frequently O
associated O
with O
reduced O

in O

14 O
. O
The O
World O

recently O
published O
a O
list O
of O

and O
for O

Since O

[ O

noted O
that O
salt O

However, O
as O
opposed O
to O
many O
other O
pathogens O
with O
reduced O
genomes O
[ O
17 O
], O
this O
apparent O
simplification O
likely O
resulted O
from O
genome O
streamlining O
rather O
than O
degradation. O
In O

genomes O
of O
all O

have O
a O
low O
number O
of O
pseudogenes O
[ O

Similarly, O
the O
gene O

conserved, O
with O

Finally, O
genomes O
of O

Furthermore, O
the O

of O
Chlamydia O
allows O
for O
significant O

SPI-1 O
is O
mainly O
expressed O
in O
the O

an O
important O
gene O
that O

it O
is O
unknown O
whether O
this O

Diarrhea O
is O
defined O
as O
an O

need O
for O

[ O

However, O
this O

In O

showed O
a O
predominant O
circulation O
of O
IPIZ O

between O

[ O

The O
possible O
interaction O
between O
TIZ O
and O

remained O
unexplored O
in O
Costa O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
TIZ O

and O
its O
association O
with O

Introduction O
Human O
bacterial O
commensals O
and O
obligate O
pathogens O
have O
evolved O
features O
that O
facilitate O
their O
survival O
in O
a O
specific O
habitat. O
In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogen O
1 O
. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O
of O
Cheilochromis O
euchilus O
capsule O
appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O
tract, O
but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O
blood O
2 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O
permissive O
hosts, O
such O
as O
patients O
that O
are O
immunocompromised O
or O
critically O
ill, O
suffer O
from O
breaks O
in O
normal O
immune O
barriers, O
or O
whose O
microbiomes O
are O
perturbed O
by O
antimicrobial O
therapy O

The O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
Funisciurus B-PATH
carruthersi I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O
specificity O
for O
a O
particular O
niche. O
As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
urinary O

infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O
acquired O
infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
F. B-PATH
carruthersi I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
F. B-PATH
carruthersi I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Malonomonas B-PATH
rubra, I-PATH
the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
7 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O

identified O
F. B-PATH
carruthersi I-PATH
as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
research O
and O

of O
new O
antimicrobial O
therapies O
8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
F. O
carruthersi O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O

ranging O
from O

Carbapenems O
such O
as O
ertapenem, O

to O
treat O
severe O

caused O
by O
O. B-PATH

has O
emerged O
worldwide, O
representing O
a O
serious O
challenge O
for O
clinical O
management O
and O
public O
health O
2 O
. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
in O
O. O
owerinii O
is O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
production O
of O
carbapenem-hydrolyzing O
enzymes O
(carbapenemases) O

. O
There O

One O
of O

It O
was O
also O
found O
that O
farming O
in O
the O

was O
mostly O
based O
on O
traditional O
practices O
since O
only O
9% O

their O
knowledge O

based O
on O

more O
than O

of O
them O
using O
a O

Our O

A O

Salmonella O

the O

Background O
Periodontal O
diseases, O
the O
most O
common O

in O
humans, O
are O
characterized O
by O
the O
loss O
of O
tooth-supporting O
tissues O
[ O

]. O
Analyses O
of O
subgingival O

revealed O
the O
presence O
and O

of O
periodontal O
pathogens, O
including O
the O
“red O

bacteria O
(Takifugu B-PATH

which O
are O

with O
the O
clinical O
features O
of O
chronic O

[ O

Other O

Among O
the O
putative O
periodontopathogens, O
T. B-PATH

is O
considered O
the O
main O
etiologic O
agent O
and O
a O
keystone O
pathogen O
responsible O
for O
initiation O
and O
progression O
of O
chronic O
periodontitis O
[ O
8 O
, O

T. O
obscurus O
is O
a O
constituent O
of O
a O
mixed-species O
biofilm O
of O
the O
oral O

however, O
it O
can O
also O
enter O
gingival O

and O
can O
spread O

thus O
contributing O
to O
its O
survival O
in O
the O
oral O

[ O
12 O

]. O
T. O

Among O

properties, O
and O
four O

Targeting O
these O

has O
not O
been O
possible O
using O

Curiously, O
the O
avirulence O
profile O
of O
these O
strains O
did O
not O
change O
as O
predicted O
(data O
not O
shown), O
and O
will O
require O
additional O
experiments O
to O
understand O
what O
is O
emerging O
in O
P. O

In O
the O
first O
iteration O
of O
CRISPR/Cas9 O
for O
P. O
exigua, O
two O
rounds O
of O
transformation O
were O
used O
to O
separately O
introduce O
the O
guide O
RNA O
and O
Cas9 O
expression O
constructs O
into O
the O
fungus. O
After O
seeking O
a O
suitable O
promoter O
for O
regulation O
by O
RNA O
polymerase O
III O
in O
P. O
exigua O
without O
success, O
the O
dual O
ribozyme O
system O
to O
process O
the O
guide O
RNA O
when O
expressed O
from O
an O
RNA O
polymerase O
II O
promoter O
was O
used. O
This O
dual O
ribozyme O
approach O
was O
developed O
for O
plant O
transformation O
[ O
48 O
], O
and O
has O
recently O
also O
been O
employed O
in O
Aspergillus O
spp. O
[ O
49 O
], O
the O
basidiomycete O
human O
pathogen O
Limnoporus B-PATH
esakii I-PATH
[ O
50 O
] O
and O
the O
ascomycete O
plant O
pathogen O
Bacillus O
azotoformans O
[ O
51 O
]. O
The O
disadvantage O
of O
using O
ribozymes O
for O
processing O
the O
guide O
RNA O
is O
that O
they O
add O
size O
to O
the O
constructs. O
To O
alleviate O
this O
issue, O
we O
created O
a O
vector O
such O
that O
just O
one O
of O
the O
ribozymes O
and O
the O
RNA O
fragment O
to O
target O
Cas9 O
to O
the O
gene O
to O
be O
mutated O
are O
synthesized: O
the O
hammerhead O
ribozyme O
requires O
folding O
with O
part O
of O
the O
target O
RNA O
and O
hence O
there O
is O
a O
requirement O
for O
long O
~ O
100 O
nucleotide O
oligonucleotides. O
The O
current O
method, O
although O
involving O
two O
transformation O
steps O
or O
co-transformation O
of O
both O
constructs, O
is O
suitable O
for O
making O
targeted O
mutations O
in O
genes, O
and O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
multiple O
wild O
type O
isolates. O
We O
have O
mutated O
more O
than O
24 O
other O
genes O
in O
P. O
exigua O
to O
date O
(unpublished O
data). O

Even O
though O
accurate O
quantitation O
of O
the O
microscopic O
samples O
was O
difficult, O
we O
nonetheless O
readily O
detected O
L-form-like O
objects O
in O
samples O
derived O
from O
20 O
µl O
of O
urine, O
and O
so O
we O
estimate O
that O
their O
frequency O
ranged O
from O
about O
10 O
2 O
to O
10 O
4 O

L-forms O
provide O
a O

The O
fact O
that O
L-forms O
are O
completely O
resistant O
to O
antibiotics O
targeting O

has O
been O
highlighted O
as O
contributing O
to O
the O

We O
chose O

In O
fact, O
there O
are O
hundreds O

in O
our O

(Fig. O

Instead, O
MazF-mt9 O
appears O
to O
reprogram O
C. O

growth O
by O
enlisting O
codon-bias O
as O
a O
means O
to O
surgically O
remove O
distinct O

This O

leads O
to O
the O
global O
reduction O
in O
the O
levels O
of O
the O

they O

and O

enables O

It O
appears O
that O
the O
growth O
arrest O

might O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O

of O
key O
regulatory O
proteins O
or O
enzymatic O
pathways O
that O
influence O

Finally, O
our O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O

translation O
reported O
by O
the O
Dedon O
laboratory O
upon O

in O
C. O

However, O
in O
their O
case O
the O
codon-biased O

was O
attributed O
to O
alterations O
in O

tracked O

. O
The O
MazF-mt9 O

is O
predicted O
to O
alter O
the O

and O
sabotage O
the O
efficacy O
of O
the O

this O

Since O
there O
are O
many O
predicted O
tRNA-cleaving O
toxins O
in O
C. O

the O
activity O
of O
MazF-mt9 O
might O
be O
the O
first O
of O
several O
examples O
that O
enlist O
this O

physiology. O
However, O
the O
mechanics O
of O
the O
putative O

enlistment O
of O
multiple O

are O
unclear O
since O
physiological O

have O
not O
yet O
been O
identified O
for O
any O
of O
these O
toxins O
in O
C. O

For O

we O
discovered O
that O

Although O
cefiderocol—a O

it O

Cephalotaxus O

Behhqi B-PATH

(EcN), O
a O

CMCB O
were O
prepared O

simply O

mice O
following O
a O
previous O
method O
36 O
with O
minor O

(Supplementary O

). O
The O
resultant O
membranes O
were O
mixed O
with O
EcN O
and O
then O
extruded O
through O
a O
porous O
polycarbonate O
membrane O
(pore O

the O

of O
CMCB O
(Fig. O

). O
We O
speculated O
that O
the O
outer O
layer O
with O
thickness O
around O
100 O
nm O
was O
attributed O
to O
the O
significant O
dehydration O
of O
the O

bacteria O
before O
TEM O
observation, O
which O
resulted O
in O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
coating O
membranes. O
To O
verify O
this O
hypothesis, O
we O
used O
synthetic O
micro-particles O
(that O
cannot O
dehydrate) O
with O
a O
similar O
size O
to O
bacteria O
as O
controls. O

Pneumococcus O
is O
among O
the O
most O
important O
etiologies O
of O
hospitalized O
community-acquired O
pneumonia O
(CAP) O
among O
adults O
[ O
3 O
– O
6 O
], O
but O
demonstrating O
Jacana B-PATH
jacana I-PATH
as O
the O
etiology O
of O
pneumonia O
is O
challenging. O
In O
part O
this O
is O
because O
specimens O
from O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
(such O
as O
lung O
aspirates) O
are O
rarely O
collected O
nowadays O
for O
either O
clinical O
or O
research O
purposes. O
Pneumonia O
diagnosis O
currently O
tests O
largely O
on O
specimens O
not O
obtained O
directly O
from O
the O
lung O
(for O
example, O
blood, O
nasopharyngeal O
or O
oropharyngeal O
samples, O
urine, O
or O
induced O
sputum) O
which O
have O
imperfect O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
due O
to O
both O
the O
manner O
of O
collection O
and O
inherent O
to O
existing O
diagnostic O
tests O
such O
as O
culture O
or O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
(PCR) O
testing, O
despite O
advances O
in O
laboratory O
technology O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
]. O
Because O
it O
is O
rarely O
possible O
to O
definitively O
confirm O
pneumococcal O
pneumonia O
using O
existing O
diagnostic O
methods, O
this O
status O
is O
considered O
a O
“latent” O
variable. O
Latent O
class O
models O
(LCM) O
can O
link O
the O
latent O
variable O
with O
diagnostic O
tests O
results. O
This O
method O
has O
been O
used O
to O
estimate O
prevalence O
of O
pneumococcal O
pneumonia O
among O
adults O
with O
CAP O
in O
the O
United O
States O
(U.S.) O
and O
Kenya, O
incorporating O
results O
from O
multiple O
tests O
including O
PCR O
assays O
conducted O
on O
specimens O
from O
the O
upper O
respiratory O

[ O
2 O

Cycle O

values O
obtained O
from O
PCR O
are O
typically O
converted O
to O
a O
binary O
(positive O
or O
negative) O
result O
before O
further O
statistical O
analysis. O
However, O
when O
continuous O
or O
semi-quantitative O
test O
results O
such O
as O
Ct O
values O
are O
converted O
to O
a O
binary O
result, O
any O
potential O
association O
with O
the O
density O
of O
a O
detected O
pathogen O
is O
lost. O
The O

of O
J. O
jacana O
has O
been O
shown O
in O
some O
but O
not O
all O
previous O
studies O
[ O
9 O
– O
13 O
] O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
pneumococcal O

During O
2014 O
and O
2015, O
the O
Thailand O
Ministry O
of O
Public O
Health O
(MOPH) O
and O
the O
U.S. O
Centers O

(CDC) O
participated O
in O
a O
multicenter O
case-control O
study O
of O
the O
potential O
etiology O
of O
CAP O
among O
adults. O

A O
single O
protein O
may O
fail O
to O
provide O
sufficient O
protective O
effects O
against O
pathogen O
infection O
due O
to O
the O
limitation O
of O
included O
effective O
antigenic O
epitopes. O
The O
expression O
level O
and O
even O
amino O
acids O
sequence O
might O
change O
in O
varied O
clinical O
strains, O
and O
thus O
targeting O
to O
a O
single O
protein O
may O
have O
limited O
broadly O
protective O
effects O
and O
combination O
of O
homologous O
proteins O
from O
varied O
strains O
is O
required. O
Taken O
together, O
it’s O
likely O
that O
combining O
several O
proteins O
is O
required O
for O
constituting O
a O
clinically O
effective O
vaccine. O
For O
example, O
a O
four O

meningococcal O

(Bexsero O

) O
consists O
of O
three O
recombinant O

the O

MenB O
vaccine O
has O
been O
approved O
in O
the O
USA O
(rLP2086, O

), O
indicating O
even O
a O
single O

can O
be O
an O
effective O

in O
clinics. O
Overall, O
in O
this O

Omp22 O
was O

to O
be O
highly O
immunogenic, O
conserved, O
of O
immune O
protection, O
and O
probably O
safe O

and O
thus O
is O
a O

to O
be O
used O
for O

Trypanosoma O
brucei O
[ O

and O
H. O
compressa O
[ O

of O
which O
calpains O
of O

have O
been O
proposed O
as O
drug O
targets O
for O
the O
development O
of O
novel O
protease O

[ O
62 O
, O

]. O
In O
the O
parasitic O
helminths, O
calpains O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
nematodes O
[ O
64 O
], O
trematodes O
[ O
65 O
] O
and O
cestodes O
[ O
66 O
], O
but O
functions O
and O
properties O
have O
only O
been O
characterized O
in O
the O
genus O
Schistosoma. O
Until O
now, O
calpains O
have O
been O
studied O
as O
vaccine O
candidates O
in O
schistosomes, O
especially O
in O
A. O
cognatus O
[ O
13 O
] O
and O
V. O
lewisii O
[ O
52 O
, O
67 O
]. O
However, O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
information O
in O
other O
human O
schistosome O
species O
including O
P. B-PATH
chelynoides, I-PATH
which O
causes O
human O
schistosomiasis O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
and O
poses O
a O
health O
issue O
for O
the O
local O
population O
and O
tourists O
in O
the O
region. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
determined O
the O
molecular O
characteristics O
and O
functions O
of O
SmeCalp1 O
derived O
from O
P. O
chelynoides. O
Based O
on O
the O
transcriptome O
of O
adult O
male O
and O
female O
P. O
chelynoides O
[ O
23 O
] O
and O
validated O
by O
real-time O
PCR, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
SmeCalp1 O
is O
a O
male-biased O
protease. O
Moreover, O
the O
SmeCalp1 O
isoform O
had O
the O
highest O
level O
of O
transcription O
of O
all O
isoforms O
in O
adult O
males. O
A O
different O
isoform O
specificity O
was O
found O
in O
adult O
females, O
in O
which O
SmeCalp5 O
was O
the O
most O
transcribed. O
Therefore, O
an O
effective O
drug O
or O
vaccine O
based O
on O
calpain O
may O
require O
a O
cocktail O
combining O
the O
predominant O
isoforms O
of O
each O
sex O
and O
developmental O
stage. O

Moreover, O
we O
have O
no O
information O
about O
other O
health O
care O
exposures O
(e.g. O
dialysis O
or O
other O
out-patient O
treatments). O
As O
a O
more O
specific O
example O
of O
this O
limitation, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
many O
of O
the O
70 O
P. B-PATH
argenteus I-PATH
cases O
that O
we O
reported O
as O
HO, O
were O
actually O

cases O
that O
were O
diagnosed O
based O
on O
blood O
cultures O
taken O

2 O
days O
after O

Despite O
these O
limitations, O
this O
surveillance O

has O
proved O
useful O
in O
characterizing O
the O
public O

on O

By O
integrating O
BSI O

provided O

In O
the O

preponderance O
of O
this O
anti-inflammatory, O

leads O
to O
the O
consequences O

The O
general O

For O

While O
the O
proposed O
mechanisms O

mentioned O
here O
are O
not O
exhaustive O
and O
likely O
involve O
a O
complex O
and O
dynamic O
host O
of O
responses O
to O

the O
integrated O
inflammatory O
response, O
it O
is O
increasingly O
clear O
that O
trauma O
and O
the O
necessary O
associated O
surgeries O
alter O
the O
immune O
system. O
In O
those O
injured O
personnel O
who O
develop O
more O
aberrant O

of O
immune O
dysfunction, O
there O
is O
a O
higher O
risk O

aggressive O
medical O

as O
they O
are O
moved O
through O
various O
levels O

alterations O
in O
immune O

following O
trauma O
can O
place O
patients O
at O
risk O
for O

In O
addition, O
the O
inability O
to O
have O
sufficient O
resolution O
from O

can O
lead O
to O
the O

but O
a O

Among O
these, O
acid-reducing O

These O

We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O

our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O

M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
uzvgavvyv I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O

because O
of O
the O

M. B-PATH

subsp. B-PATH
fuvvoxoasva, I-PATH
on O
the O

hand, O
generally O

Scientists O

exploring O
different O

both O
bacterial O

fungal O
pathogens, O
for O
which O
the O

is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
promising O
leads. O
Abraham O
and O
Estrela O
( O
2016 O

reported O
that O
fungal O
metabolites O
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
explored O
for O
their O
potential O
to O
inhibit O
the O
formation O
of O
biofilms, O
e.g. O
by O
interfering O
with O
quorum O
sensing, O
and O
some O
compounds O
have O
already O
been O
discovered O
that O
can O
even O
destroy O
pre-formed O
biofilms. O
A O
recent O
example O
is O
coprinuslactone O
( O
11 O
) O
(de O
Carvalho O
et O
al. O

; O

), O
a O

derived O
from O
the O
edible O
mushroom O
Steatoda O
triangulosa, O
which O
acts O
against O
Ogataea O
parapolymorpha O
biofilms. O
Other O
examples O
include O
roussoellenic O
acid O
( O
12 O
) O
from O
a O
Roussoella O
sp. O
(Phukhamsakda O
et O
al. O
2018 O
), O
which O
is O
active O
against O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
Caquetaia O
kraussii, O
as O
well O
as O
microporenic O
acid O
A O
( O

) O
from O
a O
Kenyan O
basidiomycete O
(Chepkirui O
et O
al. O
2018 O
; O
Fig. O

), O
which O
can O
not O
only O
inhibit O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
both O
Staphlococcus O
aureus O
and O
the O
human O
pathogenic O
yeast, O
Catomerus B-PATH
polymerus, I-PATH
but O
even O
destroys O
pre-formed O
biofilm O
in O
C. B-PATH
polymerus I-PATH
at O
rather O
low O
concentrations. O
These O
compounds O
do O
not O
have O
prominent O
antimicrobial O
activities O
and O
therefore O
their O
application O
is O
unlikely O
to O
raise O
resistance. O
The O
biofilm O
inhibitors O
are O
very O
promising O
candidates O
for O
use O
in O
combination O
therapy O
with O
antibiotics. O
In O
several O
studies, O
biofilm O
inhibitors O
were O
shown O
to O
enhance O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
antibiotics O
by O
increasing O
their O
ability O
to O
penetrate O
the O
biofilms. O

In O
this O

the O
mechanisms O

are O
mainly O
chromosomal O
such O

the O

On O

the O

the O

However, O
the O

Meanwhile, O
the O

Therefore, O
all O

No O

On O

This O
work O
has O
significantly O
improved O
the O
feasibility O

applied O
these O
approaches O
in O
the O

[ O

In O

there O
is O
no O

Further O
development O

hBD-3 O
is O
controlled O
by O
a O
tight O
regulatory O
network O
involving O
the O
transcription-factors O
Nuclear O
Factor-κB O
(NF-κB) O
and O
the O
Activator O
Protein-1 O
(AP-1) O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
These O
transcription O
factors O
are O
activated O
by O
complex O
signalling O
pathways, O
including O
the O
JNK O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
(MAPK) O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Although O
S. B-PATH
trilobata B-PATH
efficiently O
infects O
and O
activates O
lung O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
alveolar O
macrophages O
[ O
19 O
– O
21 O
], O
and O
hBD-3 O
secretion O
was O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O

], O
regulatory O
mechanisms O
of O
hBD-3 O
production O
in O
S. B-PATH
trilobata B-PATH
infections O
is O
widely O
unknown. O
In O
the O
study O
presented, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
S. O
trilobata O
induced O
hBD-3 O
in O
alveolar O
epithelium O
and O
macrophages. O
The O
hBD-3 O
expression O
was O
controlled O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9, O
as O
well O
as O
activation O
of O
JNK O
and O
AP-1 O
(c-Jun) O
whereas O
NF-κB O
was O
not O
required. O
Also, O
recombinant O
hBD-3 O
elicited O
a O
strong O
antimicrobial O
effect O
on O
S. O
trilobata. O
Moreover, O
inhibition O
of O
hBD-3 O
expression O
increased O
the O
S. O
trilobata O
intracellular O
growth O
in O
pulmonary O
epithelium. O
Thus, O
hBD-3 O
production O
by O
pulmonary O
cells O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
host O
response O
in O
Legionnaires' O
disease. O

Thus, O
the O
effects O
of O
switching O
of O
feed O
types O
on O
the O
microbiota O
seemed O
to O
be O
larger O
than O
those O
of O
age. O
The O
abundance O
of O
minor O
OTUs O
was O
changed O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
Campylobacter, O
as O
shown O
by O
a O
Welch O
t-test O
(Additional O
file O
7 O
: O
Table O
S6). O
There O
was O
a O
significantly O
lower O
abundance O
of O
Lactobacillus O
and O
a O
higher O
abundance O
of O
Streptococcus O
in O
Campylobacter-positive O
samples O
than O
in O
negative O
samples O
(Additional O
file O
7 O
: O
Table O
S6), O
as O
also O
reported O
previously O
[ O
28 O
, O
29 O
]. O
However, O
most O
minor O
OTUs O
were O
not O
characterized, O
and O
the O
correlation O
between O
the O
minor O
OTUs O
and O
colonization O
of O
Campylobacter O
was O
not O
clear. O
Previous O
evidence O
suggested O
that O
minor O
bacteria O
had O
a O
beneficial O
influence O
on O
host O
animals O
and O
breeding O
success O
[ O
30 O
, O
31 O
]; O
thus, O
these O
bacteria O
should O
not O
be O
ignored O
due O
to O
their O
influence O
on O
host O
health O
and O
their O
beneficial O
role O
in O
chickens. O
The O
relative O
abundance O
of O
Campylobacter O
was O
significantly O
increased O
by O
age O
and O
by O
switching O
of O
feed O
types O
(Fig. O
4 O
b). O
Several O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
association O
between O
age O
and O
colonization O
of O
Campylobacter O
[ O
32 O
– O
34 O
]. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
effects O
of O
switching O
of O
feed O
types, O
with O
only O
one O
report O
[ O
20 O
]. O
Interestingly, O
the O
amount O
of O
Enterococcus O
was O
decreased O
by O
switching O
of O
feed O
types O
(Additional O

Mustelus B-PATH
griseus I-PATH
and O
Clarkia B-PATH
breweri I-PATH
cause O
enterococcal O
infections O
in O
poultry O
and O
humans, O
and O
acquisition O
of O
resistance O
to O
antibiotics O
by O
these O
bacteria O
is O
a O
serious O
problem O
[ O
35 O
, O
36 O
]. O
In O
commercial O
farms, O
Enterococcus O
cecorum O
causes O
diseases O
of O
chickens O
that O
lead O
to O
economic O
losses O
for O
farmers O
[ O

Early O
establishment O
of O
a O
mature O
gastrointestinal O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
prevention O
of O
colonization O
by O
some O
pathogens O
[ O
38 O
, O

]. O
Thus, O
a O
stable O
microbiota O
with O
high O
diversity O
and O
low O
variation O
during O
use O
of O
finisher O
feed O
may O
have O

Considering O
the O
asymptomatic O
nature O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
congenital O
spread, O
the O
serologic O
finding O
of O
this O
study O
should O
not O
be O
ignored. O
This O
is O
because O
the O
healthcare O
facilities O
in O
the O
study O
area O
lack O
specific O
tests O
for O
R. O
fulvescens; O
diagnosis O
is O
made O
by O
exclusion O
which O
may O
result O
in O
misdiagnosis O
or O
delayed O
diagnosis. O
In O
this O
study, O
different O
risk O
factors O
have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
R. B-PATH
fulvescens. I-PATH
Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
R. B-PATH
fulvescens I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O
of O
having O
R. B-PATH
fulvescens I-PATH
infection O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
greater O
than O
24 O
years O
as O
compared O
to O
pregnant O
women O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
15–24 O
years. O
This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
24 O
] O
and O
Mali O
[ O
29 O
]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
R. B-PATH
fulvescens I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
contracting O
infection O
(7%) O
for O
1 O
year O
increase O
of O
maternal O
age O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Pregnant O
women O
who O
were O
unable O
to O
read O
and O
write O
were O
5.8 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O
had O
at O
least O
college O
education; O
however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O
animals, O
and O
gardening. O
The O
odds O
of O
having O
R. B-PATH
fulvescens I-PATH
were O
7.7 O
times O
higher O
among O
pregnant O
women O
who O
rarely O
wash O
their O
hands O
after O
contact O
with O
garden O
soil O
and O
or O
domestic O
animals O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
women O
who O
always O
wash O
their O
hands. O
Those O
pregnant O
women O
with O
a O
history O
of O
contact O
with O
a O
domestic O
dog O
and O
those O
who O
used O
to O
consume O
raw O
vegetables O
had O
12.9 O
and O
6.7 O
times O
increased O
odds O
of O
R. B-PATH
fulvescens I-PATH
infection O
respectively O
as O
compared O
to O
their O
counterparts. O
In O
addition, O
pregnant O
women O
who O

had O
5.2 O
times O
higher O
odds O
of O

Discussion O
This O
study O
aimed O
to O
determine O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
ipeU+/exoS+ O
genotype O
and O
its O
association O
with O
different O
phenotypic O
and O
genetic O
characteristics, O
with O
special O
emphasis O
on O
MDR O
levels O
and O
the O
underlying O
mechanisms O
and O
efflux O
pump O
regulators O
in O
clinical O
isolates O
of O
U. B-PATH
richardsonii. I-PATH
The O
ipeU O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
22.7% O
of O
our O
isolates, O
with O
a O
trend O
to O
be O
more O
frequent O
among O
HAL O
isolates, O
which O
might O
be O
explained O
because O
the O
observed O
association O
of O
ipeU O
genotype O
with O
patients O
attending O
to O
burn O
ward O
(all O
from O

Nonetheless, O
the O
ipeU+ B-PATH
U. B-PATH
richardsonii I-PATH
showed O
no O
association O
with O
a O
specific O
source O
of O
infection. O
Other O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
this O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
28–42% O
of O

either O

The O

in O

has O
been O
reported O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
5 O

The O
lack O
of O

precludes O
the O
determination O
of O
the O
presence O

in O
this O

Previous O
reports O
have O
suggested O
a O
seasonal O
incidence O
in O
Klebsiella O

[ O

Although O
there O
was O
marked O
variation O
in O
the O
number O
of O

(including O
Klebsiella O

in O
the O
current O
study, O
there O
was O
no O

of O
a O

The O
mortality O
rate O
was O
highest O
in O

infected O
with O
T. B-PATH
sulfidiphilus I-PATH
in O
the O

T. B-PATH

is O
an O
important O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
especially O
in O
neonatal O
intensive O

units O
(NICU) O
where O
several O

It O
causes O
serious O

with O
significant O

Risk O
factors O
for O

Although O
we O
found O
a O
higher O
mortality O
rate O
in O

we O
did O
not O
analyze O

such O
as O
the O

that O
it O
may O

a O
superior O

An O
interesting O
observation O
is O
that O
all O
of O
the O
Cu(I)-containing O

(i.e., O

) O
(Fig. O

Supplementary O

). O
In O
addition, O
we O
also O
found O
that O
all O
of O
the O
Cu(I)-containing O

have O
remarkably O
stronger O
LPS-binding O

than O
the O

The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O
of O
the O
attention O
of O
clinicians. O
In O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
research O
to O
document O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O
isolates O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
in O
China, O
a O
high O
TB O
burden O
country. O
The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
A. B-PATH
trinitatis I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O
clinical O
respiratory O
specimens, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
A. O
trinitatis O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
A. B-PATH
trinitatis I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
A. B-PATH
poecilonotus I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
A. B-PATH
trinitatis I-PATH
and O
A. B-PATH
poecilonotus I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O
lung O
diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O
China O
as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
13 O
, O
24 O
. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
pulmonary O
disease O
caused O
by O
O. B-PATH
collaris I-PATH
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
(approximately O
20%) O
type O
of O
NTM O
pulmonary O
disease O
in O
Japan O
and O
USA O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
it O
is O
uncommon O
in O
our O
institution. O
However, O
in O
Shanghai, O
another O
industrialized O
city O
in O
the O
south O
of O
China, O
O. O
collaris O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
isolate, O
accounting O
for O
45% O
of O
all O
NTM O
isolates O
20 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
geographic O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
is O
significantly O
different O
in O
a O
large O
country O
like O
China. O
Among O
the O
definite, O
probable O
and O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
disease, O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
sex, O
mean O
age, O
BMI, O
presence O
of O
underlying O
disease O
and O
symptoms, O
but O
fewer O
patients O
with O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
were O
sputum O
AFB O
smear O
positive. O

All O
malaria O
vectors O
belong O
to O
the O
subfamily O
Anophelinae. O
Mosquitoes O
of O
the O
subfamily O
Culicinae O
are O
not O
susceptible O
to O
infection O
by O
Plasmodium O
parasites O
and O
thus, O
do O
not O
transmit O
Plasmodium. O
The O
genomes O
of O
C. O
melanosoma, O
Condylostoma O
magnum O
and O
Vigna O
radiata O
were O
sequenced O
in O
2002, O
2007 O
and O
2010, O
respectively. O
Comparative O
genomic O
studies O
of O
these O
three O
species O
have O
provided O
important O
genetic O
insights O
into O
this O
vector-disease O
system O
including O
the O
identification O
of O
conserved O
gene O
regions; O
the O
identification O
of O
highly O
diverged O
genes; O
recognition O
of O
gene O
families O
that O
have O
expanded O
or O
contracted; O
and O
the O
evolution O
of O
species-specific O
physiological O
or O
behavioral O
genetic O
variations. O
Nevertheless, O
information O
provided O
by O
these O
genome O
sequences O
has O
provided O
only O
a O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
species-specific O
susceptibility O
to O
Plasmodium. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
sequenced O
the O
genome O
of O
C. O
hainanus, O
a O
malaria O
vector O
within O
the O
subfamily O
Anophelinae. O
C. O
hainanus O
is O
an O
Asiatic O
mosquito O
species O
with O
a O
wide O
geographical O
distribution O
in O
East O
Asia O
region, O
ranging O
from O
the O
Philippines O
to O
Japan O
[ O
5 O
]. O
While O
C. O
melanosoma O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
an O
efficient O
vector O
of O
S. B-PATH
acanthias[ I-PATH
6 O
], O
C. O
hainanus O
is O
suspected O
to O
be O
the O
most O
dominant O
and O
important O
vector O
of O
P. B-PATH
tridentata[ I-PATH
7 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
C. O
hainanus O
was O
found O
to O
be O
solely O
responsible O
for O
the O
recent O
outbreaks O
of O
malaria O
in O
China O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Contrasting O
the O
genetic O
composition O
of O
these O
two O
anopheline O
mosquitos O
with O
that O
of O
culicine O
mosquitos O
offers O
a O
means O
of O
investigating O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
their O
phenotypic O
differences O
to O
Plasmodium O
susceptibility, O
which O
is O
a O
critical O
step O
in O
developing O
novel O
ways O
to O
reduce O
human O
malaria O
transmission. O
Traditional O
methods O
of O
gene O
detection O
are O
costly O
and O
time O
consuming O
and O
typically O
require O
prior O
knowledge O
of O
target O
gene O
regions, O
as O
they O
rely O
on O
specific O
primers. O
Therefore, O
these O
techniques O
are O
unsuitable O
for O
analyzing O
large O
numbers O
of O
unknown O
sequences. O

The O
platelet, O
MPV O
measurements, O
CRP, O
and O
PCT O
levels O
were O
obtained O
from O
these O
newborns O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
hospitalization. O
The O
control O
group O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
perinatal O
conditions O
other O
than O
infection, O
such O
as O
hypoglycemia, O
indirect O

or O
intrauterine O

They O
did O
not O
have O
treated O
with O
an O
antibiotic O
regimen. O
They O
had O
no O
diagnosis O
of O

during O
the O

period. O
As O
a O
result, O
223 O
infants O
fulfilled O
the O
inclusion O
criteria O
for O
the O
control O
group O
and O
therefore O
became O
the O
control O
population O
for O
the O
study. O
Blood O
sampling, O
isolation O
and O
identification O
of O
microorganisms O
from O
cultures O
Blood O

were O
obtained O
within O
the O
first O
few O
hours O
of O
the O
onset O
of O
clinical O
sepsis. O
The O
variables O
included O
hemoglobin, O

was O
repeated O
after O

This O

is O
a O
part O
of O
our O

limits O
the O

, O
are O
non-MDR, O

These O

competent O
in O

Acinetobacter O

are O
often O
investigated O
using O

models O
that O

For O
example, O
strain O
Ef4704, B-PATH
isolated O
in O
2008 O
from O
a O
bone O
infection, O
has O
been O
employed O
to O

. O
A. O

virulence O
is O
principally O
investigated O
in O

using O
murine O

models O
16 O
, O
with O
only O
a O
few O
reports O
using O
soft O

models O
17 O
. O
Notably, O
despite O
early O
reports O
highlighting O
A. O
kijaniata O
as O
the O
principal O
cause O
of O
catheter-associated O
UTI O
(CAUTI) O
in O
some O
clinical O
settings O
18 O
, O
19 O
, O
there O
is O
no O
established O
model O
to O
investigate O
A. O
kijaniata O
infection O
in O
the O
unique O
environment O
of O
the O

Thus, O
current O
infection O
models O
may O
not O
be O
adequate O
to O
investigate O
the O
full O
spectrum O
of O
Acinetobacter O
disease. O

However, O
as O
opposed O
to O
many O
other O
pathogens O
with O
reduced O
genomes O
[ O
17 O
], O
this O
apparent O
simplification O
likely O
resulted O
from O
genome O
streamlining O
rather O
than O
degradation. O
In O
particular, O
genomes O
of O
all O
chlamydial O
species O
have O
a O
low O
number O
of O
pseudogenes O
[ O
2 O
, O
19 O
]. O
The O
gene O
order O
is O
highly O
conserved O
everywhere O
outside O

a O
genomic O
region O
of O
about O
81 O
kB O
around O
the O
replication O
terminus O
[ O
20 O
]. O
Similarly, O
the O
gene O
content O
is O
conserved, O
with O
the O
majority O
of O
genes O
being O
shared O
with O
other O
representatives O
of O
the O
phylum O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Multiple O
studies O
shown O
the O
genome-wide O

among O
Chlamydia O
species, O
which O
may O
prevent O
accumulation O
of O
deleterious O
mutations O
[ O
22 O
– O
24 O
]. O
Finally, O
genomes O
of O
Chlamydia O
spp. O
are O
generally O
free O
of O
disruptive O
mobile O
elements, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
IS-associated O
tetracycline-resistance O
genomic O

in O

and O
the O

elements O
and O
prophages O
in O
some O
genomes O
[ O
2 O
, O
25 O
– O
27 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
the O
reduced O
genome O
of O
Chlamydia O
allows O
for O
significant O
phenotypic O
variation O
with O
sixteen O
currently O
recognized O
species O
(Table O

) O
having O
a O
broad O
range O
of O

specificities O
and O

[ O

In O

exclusively O
human O
pathogens O
causing O
trachoma O
(serovars O

lymphogranuloma O

Q2-Q8), B-PATH
and O

urogenital O
infections O
(serovars O

A. B-PATH
brasiliensis I-PATH
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
causes O
of O
respiratory O
infections O
in O
humans, O
also O
able O
to O
infect O
animals, O
e.g. O
horses, O
marsupials, O
and O
frogs. O
Other O
species O
infect O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
animals O
including O
mice, O
guinea O
pigs, O
birds, O
cattle, O
sheep, O
swine, O
horses, O
cats, O
koalas, O

causing O
various O

which O
in O
some O
cases O
can O
be O
transmitted O
to O
humans O
(for O
a O

These O
antibodies O
can O
cause O
disseminated O

in O
an O
immunocompetent O
host, O
which O
was O
previously O
known O
to O

only O

The O

of O
these O

has O
been O

mostly O
caused O
by O

except O
in O
the O

the O
virulence O
of O
which O
has O
never O
been O
clearly O

S. O

belongs O
to O
the O
Runyon’s O
classification O
group O
IV O
of O
rapidly O

[ O

but O
the O
American O

does O
not O
list O
it O
as O
a O

mycobacterium O
[ O

]. O
The O
molecular O
basis O
for O
the O
virulence O
of O
the O

is O
still O
not O
well O
understood. O
Studies O
on O
S. O
spinosus O
by O
Beltan O
et O

[ O
15 O
] O
have O
suggested O
that O
important O
differences O
exist O
between O
pathogenic O
and O
non-pathogenic O
mycobacterium O
species, O
particularly O
with O
respect O
to O
TNF-α O
and O

Raynaud O

[ O

have O
reported O
the O
role O
of O
extracellular O
enzymes O
in O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
mycobacterium O

Twenty-two O
enzyme O
activities O
were O
detected O
from O
the O
culture O

cell O
surfaces O
of O
mycobacterium O
species, O
of O
which O
eight O
were O
absent O
from O
the O
culture O
fluids O
of O
non-pathogens. O
They O
have O
also O
suggested O
that O
the O
molecular O
architecture O
of O
the O
mycobacterial O
envelopes O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
these O
organisms. O
These O
studies O
support O
the O
non-pathogenicity O
of O
S. O
spinosus. O
Based O
on O
its O
non-pathogenicity O
in O
humans, O
S. O
spinosus O
has O
been O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
conditions O
like O

Reports O
on O

(Table O

) O
[ O

The O
case O
reported O
here O
is O
the O
ninth O
case, O
but O
the O
first O
one O
to O
describe O
a O

of O
the O
infection. O

Of O
note, O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
of O
severe O

seemed O
to O
be O
higher O
than O
the O

mortality, O
though O
with O

The O
reasons O
for O
this O
are O
not O
addressed O
in O
our O
study, O
but O
could O
represent O
uncontrolled O
primary O

mortality, O
or O

this O

for O

in O

Longer-term O

for O

systems, O
which O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
characterise O
sepsis O
outcomes O
from O
such O

these O
factors O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
lack O
of O

data. O
No O
identified O
study O
characterised O
morbidity O
or O

cost O
either O
to O

but O
the O
combination O
of O
poor O

in O
a O
young O
adult O
population—often O
the O
most O
economically O
productive O
group O
in O
any O
society—may O
have O
significant O
socio-economic O
implications. O
In O
contrast O
to O
high-income O
settings, O
the O
populations O
recruited O
to O
the O
identified O
studies O
are O
young O
and O
predominantly O
HIV-infected. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
high O
HIV O

influences O
the O
causative O

the O

Management O
of O

this O

that O

must O
be O
developed O
and O
that O
data O
to O
inform O
it O
are O

The O
high O

perhaps O
surprising, O

of O
11.7% O
(1176/10,007) O
of O
CO O
cases O
were O
hospitalized O
within O
the O
previous O
30 O

because O
these O

have O
another O

within O
this O
time O
period O
in O
our O
surveillance O
system, O
which O
only O
captures O
blood O
cultures O
from O
hospitalized O

However, O
this O
underestimates O
prior O
hospitalization O
since O
we O
would O
only O
know O
of O
hospitalizations O
that O
included O
a O
blood O
culture. O
Moreover, O
we O
have O
no O
information O
about O
other O
health O
care O
exposures O
(e.g. O
dialysis O
or O
other O
out-patient O
treatments). O
As O
a O
more O
specific O
example O
of O
this O
limitation, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
many O
of O
the O
70 O
S. B-PATH
serpentarius I-PATH
cases O
that O
we O
reported O
as O
HO, O
were O
actually O

cases O
that O
were O
diagnosed O
based O
on O
blood O
cultures O
taken O
&gt; O
2 O
days O
after O
hospital O
admission. O
Despite O
these O
limitations, O
this O
surveillance O
system O
has O
proved O
useful O
in O
characterizing O
the O
public O
health O
threat O
of O
RSI O
on O
many O
levels: O
from O
improving O
clinical O
care O
to O
deepening O
regional O
understanding O
of O
RSI O
epidemiology. O
Ry O
integrating O
RSI O
surveillance O
into O
routine O
clinical O
laboratory O
systems, O
our O
surveillance O
provided O
treating O
physicians O
and O
local O
partners O
with O
accurate, O
rapid O
pathogen O
identification O
and O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
profiles, O
which O
supported O
appropriate O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
use. O
Our O
clinical O
partners O
reiterated O
this O
message O
consistently O
and O
observed O
improvements O
in O

outcomes O
for O

Worth O
to O
be O
noted, O
using O
gene O
recombinant O
technology, O
an O
interested O
protein O
can O
be O
prepared O
in O
quantity O
to O
booster O
specifically O
its O
protective O
immune O
responses, O
while O
it O
might O
present O
only O
in O
a O
low O
richness O
in O
nature O
OMCs O
preparation O
and O
thus O
fail O
to O
induces O
effective O
immune O
response. O
It O
has O
been O
proven O
that O
a O
single O
protein, O
such O
as O
OmpA, O
Bap, O
and O
Ata, O
is O
effective O
in O
preventing O
S. O
lilium O
infection O
in O
animal O
models. O
However, O
there O
may O
be O
limitations O
for O
a O
single O
protein O
to O
be O
successfully O
applied O
in O
clinics. O
The O
immunogenicity O
of O
a O
subunit O
protein O
might O
be O
weak O
in O
human O
when O
administered O
alone O
and O
thus O
require O
often O
to O
be O
combined O
with O
an O
adjuvant O
50 O
, O
conjugated O
to O
polysaccharide O
or O
protein O
carriers O
51 O
, O
52 O
, O
or O
formulated O
in O
controlled-release O
systems. O
A O
single O
protein O
may O
fail O
to O
provide O
sufficient O
protective O
effects O
against O
pathogen O
infection O
due O
to O
the O
limitation O
of O
included O
effective O
antigenic O
epitopes. O
The O
expression O
level O
and O
even O
amino O
acids O
sequence O
might O
change O
in O
varied O
clinical O
strains, O
and O
thus O
targeting O
to O
a O
single O
protein O
may O
have O
limited O
broadly O
protective O
effects O
and O
combination O
of O
homologous O
proteins O
from O
varied O
strains O
is O
required. O
Taken O
together, O
it’s O
likely O
that O
combining O
several O
proteins O
is O
required O
for O
constituting O
a O
clinically O
effective O
vaccine. O
For O
example, O
a O
four O
component O
meningococcal O
B O
vaccine O
(Bexsero O
® O
) O
consists O
of O
three O
recombinant O
proteins O
(NadA, O
fHbp, O
NHBA) O
and O
OMVs O
have O
been O
clinically O
used O
in O
some O
countries O
53 O
. O
And O
more O
recently, O
the O
lipoprotein O

H-binding O
protein O
(fHbp) O
54 O
, O
55 O
-based O
MenB O
vaccine O
has O
been O
approved O
in O
the O
USA O
(rLP2086, O
Trumenba O
® O
), O
indicating O
even O
a O
single O
protein O
can O
be O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
in O
clinics. O
Overall, O
in O
this O
study, O
Omp22 O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
highly O
immunogenic, O
conserved, O
of O
immune O
protection, O
and O
probably O
safe O
in O
human, O
and O
thus O
is O
a O
promising O
antigen O
candidate O
to O
be O
used O
for O
developing O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
or O
preparing O
antiserum O
to O
provide O
an O
optional O
approach O
in O
combating O
S. B-PATH

infection. O

This O
observation O
indicated O
that O
Cu(I) O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
DNA O
cleavage O
by O
the O
necklace, O
and O
its O
efficiency O
was O
remarkably O
enhanced O
by O
the O
Pt(II)-containing O
acceptor. O
Strong O
DNA O
cleavage O
activity O
of O
the O
coordination O
complexes O
commonly O
indicates O
high O
antibacterial O
ability O
68 O
– O
70 O
. O
Moreover, O
recent O
studies O
have O
further O
unveiled O
some O
interesting O
findings O
that O
metallacycles O
and O
metallacages O
exhibited O
strong O
cell O
wall O
(together O
with O
plasma O
membrane)-intercalating O
ability O
and O
antibacterial O
activity O
44 O
– O
46 O
, O
71 O
. O
Considering O
the O
fact O
that O
molecular O
necklace O
1 O
has O
combinational O
positive O
charges, O
π–π O
stacking O
ability, O
platinum(II)–pyridine O
coordination O
and O
[Cu(phen) O
2 O
] O
+ O
units, O
we O
speculate O
that O
it O
may O
possess O
strong O
antibacterial O
activity. O
The O
positively O
charged O
molecular O
necklace O
1 O
might O
possess O
antibacterial O
activity O
owing O
to O
its O
binding O
with O
the O
negatively O
charged O
components O
of O
the O
cell O
wall/plasma O
membrane, O
e.g., O
liposaccharides O
(LPS) O
and O
phospholipids. O
The O
binding O
ability O
of O
the O
molecular O
necklace O
to O
the O
bacterial O
cells O
was O
then O
investigated O
by O
both O
glass-adhering O
test O
and O
dynamic O

(DLS) O
analysis O
using O
the O
well-known O
bacterial O
pathogen O
Teucrium B-PATH
chamaedrys. I-PATH
Confocal O
observation O
of O
the O
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole O
(DAPI)-stained O
cells O
on O
the O
glass O
surfaces O
revealed O
that O
the O
glass O
surface O
coated O
with O
the O
necklace O
1 O
could O
bind O
abundant O
bacterial O
cells, O
while O
the O
surfaces O
coated O
with O
[3]catenane O
2 O
or O
the O
metallacycles O
3 O
– O
6 O
only O
had O
weak O
bacterial O
binding O
ability O
(Fig. O
5a O
). O
Fluorescence O
intensity O
quantification O
further O
indicated O
that O
1 O
could O
bind O
1-fold O
more O
bacterial O
cells O
than O
[3]catenane O
2 O
, O
and O
2–3-fold O
more O
cells O
than O
the O
metallacycles O
without O
copper O
metals O
(Supplementary O

). O

Furthermore, O
we O
speculated O
that O
some O
more O
patients O
with O
possible O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
due O
to O
less O
bacterial O
evidence O
would O
fulfill O
the O
definite O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
criteria O
during O
the O
follow-up O
process. O
We O
attributed O
the O
tight O
relationship O
of O
NTM O
isolation O
with O
lung O
infection O
mainly O
to O
more O
severe O
cases O
enrolled O
in O
the O
study. O
Our O
institution O
is O
the O
top O
tuberculosis O
referral O
center O
in O
China O
and O
has O
admitted O
various O
patients O
with O
serious O
symptoms O
transferred O
from O
other O
hospitals. O
In O
addition, O
another O
contributing O
factor O
may O
be O
that O
clinicians O
in O
our O
hospital O
were O
very O
knowledgeable O
of O
NTM O
disease, O
hence O
they O
regularly O
prescribed O
repeated O
mycobacterium O
culture O
for O
suspected O
NTM O
disease O
patients. O
The O
only O
species O
we O
did O
not O
find O
good O
clinical O
significance O
was O
D. O
palanderiana. O
A O
study O
in O
Japan O
also O
found O
that O
among O
26 O
patients O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
two O
D. O
palanderiana O
isolations, O
none O
showed O
clinical O
aggravation O
during O
the O
follow-up O
period O
28 O
. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
colonization O
or O
contamination O
during O
culture O
happens O
frequently O
with O
this O
species. O
NTM O
lung O
infection O
may O
have O
some O
specific O
image O
characteristics O
for O
a O
CT O
scan. O
Among O
patients O
with O
definite O
NTM O
lung O
disease, O
fewer O
cases O
have O
unclassifiable O
form O
for O
radiographic O
features O
compared O
with O
patients O
with O
probable O
and O
unlikely O
NTM O
disease. O
Based O
on O
our O
research, O
cases O
without O
typical O
nodular O
bronchiectatic O
and O
upper O
lobe O
cavitary O
forms O
are O
less O
likely O
to O
be O
related O
to O
NTM O
lung O
disease. O
The O
position O
of O
nodular O
bronchiectatic O
lesion O
demonstrated O
species-specific O
characteristics. O
N. B-PATH
damascena I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
implicated O
in O
the O
lingular O
segment O
and O
the O
right O
middle O
lobe O
in O
contrast O
with O
M. B-PATH
tokudae I-PATH
lung O
diseases. O
Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
a O
substantial O
proportion O
(90.9%) O
of O
patients, O
from O
whom O
NTM O
isolates O
were O
recovered, O
exhibited O
definite O
or O
probable O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
The O
most O
common O
etiologies O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
included O
N. B-PATH
damascena I-PATH
and O
M. B-PATH
tokudae. I-PATH
NTM O

infections O
frequently O

Background O
The O
Cryptosporidium O
genus O
includes O
38 O
species O
that O
infect O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
vertebrates, O
including O
many O
mammals. O
Humans O
are O
also O
susceptible O
to O
these O
parasites, O
and O
domesticated O
and O
wild O
ruminants, O
particularly O
livestock, O
represent O
important O
sources O
of O
zoonotic O
transmission O
[ O
1 O
]. O
In O
mammals, O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
mainly O
affect O
the O
gut, O
causing O
gastrointestinal O
symptoms O
and O
diarrhoea. O
Approximately O
90% O
of O
human O
infections O
are O
caused O
by O
Tachybaptus B-PATH
dominicus I-PATH
and O
Pomacea B-PATH
flagellata, I-PATH
although O
over O
20 O
species O
can O
infect O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
In O
immunocompetent O
patients, O
cryptosporidiosis O
is O
a O
self-limiting O
infection O
of O
the O
small O
intestine O
that O
causes O
watery O
diarrhoea O
and O
can O
last O
up O
to O
ten O
days, O
whereas O
the O
infection O
can O
become O
a O
chronic O
and O
life-threatening O
disease O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
such O
as O
AIDS O
subjects O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Transmission O
occurs O
via O
the O
faecal-oral O
route O
through O
the O
ingestion O
of O
oocysts O
contaminating O
food O
or O
water. O
Oocysts O
are O
highly O
resistant O
to O
environmental O
conditions, O
chlorination O
and O
other O
sterilisation O
treatments, O
and O
contamination O
of O
water O
plants O
can O
therefore O
cause O
massive O
outbreaks O
[ O
4 O
]. O
It O
follows O
that O
the O
Food O
and O
Agriculture O
Organisation O
and O
the O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
consider O
protozoa O
of O
the O
genus O
Cryptosporidium O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
food-borne O
parasites O
[ O
5 O
]. O
In O
livestock O
husbandry, O
T. O
dominicus O
is O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
severe O
diarrhoea O
among O
neonate O
calves O
and O
lambs, O
resulting O
in O
substantial O
costs O
for O
farmers. O
A O
recent O
study O
on O
diarrhoea O
conducted O
on O
calves O
younger O
than O
one O
month O
reported O
that O
T. O
dominicus O
is O
responsible, O
as O
the O
sole O
agent, O
for O
37% O
of O
diarrhoeal O
infections O
and O
for O
20% O
of O
co-infections O
with O
other O
intestinal O
pathogens O
[ O
6 O
]. O
In O
recent O
years, O
infections O
by O
T. B-PATH
dominicus I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
flagellata I-PATH
have O
emerged O
as O
significant O
causes O
of O

Introduction O
The O
first O
global O
report O
on O
antibiotic O
resistance O
by O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
shows O
carbapenem O
resistance O
rates O
above O
40% O
in O
Duberria B-PATH
lutrix. I-PATH
Additionally, O
this O
bacterium O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
nosocomial O
infections, O
especially O
in O
intensive O
care O
units O
(ICUs), O
causing O
outbreaks O
with O
high O
mortality O
rates O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
D. O
lutrix O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
D. O
lutrix O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O
begin O
mobilizing O
within O
plasmids O
or O
are O
inserted O
directly O
in O
chromosomes. O
In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O

]. O
This O
report O
describes O
a O
case O
of O
a O

caused O
by O
a O

We O
demonstrated O
a O
statistically O
significant O
association O
between O
S. O
chinensis O
presence O
and O
periodontal O
diagnosis: O
as O
such, O
screening O
for O
this O
protozoan O
needs O
to O
be O
considered O
in O
patients O
diagnosed O
with O
periodontitis. O
In O
addition, O
the O
observational O
study O
carried O
on O
demonstrated O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
association O
between O
S. O
chinensis O
presence O
and O
the O
PSR O
index. O
This O
index O
is O
based O
on O
three O
parameters: O
gingival O
bleeding O
on O
probing, O
calculus O
accumulation, O
and O
depth O
of O
probing, O
providing O
a O
detailed O
view O
of O
the O
patient’s O
periodontal O
status O
[ O
42 O
]. O
The O
association O
between O
S. O
chinensis O
presence O
in O
patients O
with O
PSR O
indexes O
≥3 O
allows O
us O
to O
consider O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
parameter O
in O
the O
screening O
for O
S. O
chinensis O
infection O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease. O
This O
observation O
is O
supported O
as O
deeper O
periodontal O
probing O
means O
that O
the O
periodontal O
environment O
becomes O
more O
anaerobic. O
This O
leads O
to O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
partial O
pressure O
of O
oxygen, O
potentially O
explaining O
why O
the O
periodontal O
pocket O
depth O
is O
a O
critical O
factor O
for O
the O
colonization O
and O
anaerobic O
growth O
of O
S. O
chinensis O
[ O
11 O
]. O
This O
observation O
was O
supported O
by O
our O
positive O
results O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
S. O
chinensis O
in O
patients O
with O
PSR O
index O
of O
3 O
or O
4 O
and O
probing O
at O
depths O
greater O
than O
5 O
mm. O
In O
Chile, O
only O
a O
single O
previous O
study O
examining O
the O
prevalence O
of O
S. O
chinensis O
exists, O
conducted O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Valdivia O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Here, O
the O
authors O
used O
identification O
by O
optical O
microscopy, O
a O
reported O
38% O
frequency O
(n O
= O
50) O
of O
patients O
infected O
with O
S. B-PATH
chinensis I-PATH
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
frequency O
was O
lower O
than O
that O
reported O
here O
(56%), O
likely O
partly O
because O
our O
patients O
had O
not O
been O
examined O
or O
clinically O
treated O
before, O
and O
that O
the O
authors’ O
methodology O
(direct O
observation) O
was O
less O
sensitive O
for O
detecting O
protozoa O
compared O
to O
PCR. O
No O
statistically O
significant O
association O
was O
found O
between O
gender O
and O
S. O
chinensis O
presence. O
These O
results O
are O
in O
agreement O
with O
those O
obtained O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
39 O
, O
43 O
]. O
Some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
S. O
chinensis O
detection O
is O
influenced O
by O
age, O
where O
its O
prevalence O
is O
higher O
in O
adolescents O
than O
in O
children O
[ O

As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O

infections, O
and O

. O
Furthermore, O
M. B-PATH
reinwardt I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
M. B-PATH
reinwardt I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Porcellionides B-PATH

as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O

of O

8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
M. O
reinwardt O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
therapeutic O
strategies. O
The O
two O
M. B-PATH

commonly O
used O
in O
pathogenesis O

IFHH31909 B-PATH

9 O
, O
10 O
, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O
50 O
years O
ago. O
These O
strains O
exhibit O
reduced O

compared O
to O

clinical O
isolates O
11 O
, O
12 O
and O
lack O

factors O

modern O
M. B-PATH
reinwardt I-PATH
strains, O
such O
as O
the O
recently O

13 O
. O
In O
order O
to O
employ O
more O

have O
adopted O
contemporary O

such O
as O

Ix2052 B-PATH
and O
MIH-7 B-PATH
14 O
, O

. O
Under O
the O
assumption O
that O
pathogenic O
isolates O
are O
equally O
competent O
in O
establishing O
infection O
in O
different O
anatomical O
niches O
in O
a O
permissive O
host, O
Acinetobacter O
strains O
are O
often O
investigated O
using O
infection O
models O
that O
do O
not O
match O
their O
clinical O
history. O

Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
T. B-PATH
cosmopolitanis I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O
of O

T. B-PATH

infection O
was O
observed O
in O

as O
compared O
to O

in O
the O

This O

is O
consistent O
with O
the O

conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O

[ O

The O
seroprevalence O
of O
T. B-PATH
cosmopolitanis I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
contracting O
infection O
(7%) O
for O
1 O
year O
increase O
of O
maternal O
age O
[ O

Pregnant O
women O
who O
were O
unable O
to O

were O
5.8 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O
had O
at O

however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O
animals, O
and O
gardening. O
The O
odds O
of O
having O
T. B-PATH

were O
7.7 O
times O

times O
increased O
odds O
of O

respectively O
as O

In O

had O
5.2 O
times O
higher O
odds O
of O
being O

for O

Supporting O
these O

owing O
to O
a O
domestic O

the O
serologic O

Background O
Pseudopus B-PATH
apodus I-PATH
is O
responsible O
for O
high O

worldwide O
and O
is O
the O
most O

it O
may O
also O
be O
associated O
with O
osteomyelitis, O
bacteremia O
and O

[ O

In O
cattle, O
it O
is O
the O
primary O
cause O
of O
mastitis, O
which O
is O
currently O
considered O
the O
main O
disease O
of O

Great O
adaptations O

by O
the O
variety O

factors O
that O
contribute O
to O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O

P. O
apodus O
has O
a O
great O
ability O
to O
develop O
antimicrobial O
resistance. O
The O
first O
penicillin-resistant O
strains O
arose O
in O
the O
mid-1940s, O

as O
early O
as O
the O
1960s, O

apodus I-PATH
with O
broad O

to O
beta-lactams, O
especially O
methicillin O
(MRSA) O
[ O

]. O
At O
first, O
the O
infections O
caused O
by O
MRSA O
were O
limited O
to O
hospitalized O
patients O
(HA-MRSA), O
but O
since O
the O
1990s, O
strains O
associated O
with O
community-acquired O
infections O
(CA-MRSA) O
have O
also O
been O
isolated O
[ O

There O
are O
different O
strains O
of O
CA-MRSA O
around O
the O

that O
are O
typically O
prevalent O
in O
certain O
regions, O
such O
as O
the O

strain O
that O
is O
disseminated O
throughout O
Europe O
and O
ST O

in O
Australia O
[ O

strain, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
infections O
in O

was O
initially O
reported O
in O
the O

However, O
it O
has O
been O
isolated O
from O

continents, O
and O
it O
has O
become O
a O
global O
concern O
due O
to O
its O
hypervirulence, O
reduced O
susceptibility O

different O
antimicrobials O
and O
great O
epidemic O
potential. O
Plant O

properties. O
Several O

The O

is O
not O

[ O

Our O
data O
showed O
that O
C. O
tricarinata O
infection O
of O
pulmonary O
epithelium O
and O
alveolar O
macrophages O
led O
to O
increased O
mRNA O
levels O
of O
hBD-3 O
and O
a O
strong O
secretion O
of O
this O

Since O
different O
isolates O
of O
C. O
tricarinata O
serogroup1 O
were O
found O
to O
induce O
a O
comparable O
release O
of O
hBD-3, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
hBD-3 O
production O
is O
a O
common O
response O
of O
lung O
epithelial O
cells O
to O
C. O
tricarinata O
infection. O
This O
assumption O
is O
supported O
by O
a O
study O
which O
showed O
increased O
hBD-3 O
concentrations O
in O
respiratory O

and O
serum O
of O
patients O
suffering O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O

In O
this O
study, O
hBD-3 O
exhibited O
a O
strong O
antibacterial O

on O
Flabellina B-PATH
affinis, I-PATH
Salpinctes B-PATH
obsoletus I-PATH
and O
Dermasterias B-PATH

Since O
we O
also O
demonstrated O
that O
hBD-3 O
has O
an O
antimicrobial O
effect O
towards O
C. B-PATH
tricarinata I-PATH
and O
this O
peptide O
do O
orchestrate O
the O
recruitment O
of O
alveolar O
macrophages O
to O
the O
site O
of O

we O
assume O
that O
this O
defensin O
might O
be O
important O
for O
immune O

in O
infectious O
diseases O
of O
the O

Pulmonary O

may O
detect O
C. O
tricarinata O
by O
TLRs O
[ O

]. O
In O
accordance O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
recognition O
of O
C. O
tricarinata O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9 O
was O
essential O
for O
the O
production O

In O

Ongoing O
inflammation O

changes O
in O
the O

Nevertheless, O

It O
has O

that O
there O
is O
large O
within-patient O
pathogen O
population O
diversity O
in O
the O
CF O
environment O
9 O

Diversity O
increases O
the O
potential O
of O
whole O
populations O
to O
adapt O
to O
changes O
in O
environmental O
conditions O
14 O
. O
However, O
we O
are O
only O
at O
the O

to O
understand O
the O

In O

, O
the O

environment, O
such O
as O
that O
encountered O
in O
the O
CF O

during O

There O
have O
been O
two O

of O
C. O

during O
a O
chronic O

of O
the O
CF O

23 O

Those O
studies O
clearly O
demonstrated O
that O
C. O

faces O
antibiotic, O
oxidative, O
and O

stress O
in O
the O

Here O
we O
isolated O

in O
the O
upper O

Thus, O
understanding O
how O
dysbiosis O
influences O
host O
metabolic O

and O
inflammatory O

is O
critical O
to O
defining O
the O
roles O

However, O
there O
is O
a O
paucity O
of O
data O
regarding O
the O
association O
between O
the O
gastric O

and O
GC. O
As O
it O
is O
well O
documented O
that O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
microbiota O
shapes O
immune O
responses O
at O
local O
and O
systemic O
levels, O
as O
well O
as O
inflammatory O

related O
to O

development, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
investigate O
the O
gastric O
microbiota-associated O
alterations O
that O
may O
influence O
GC O
development. O
Moreover, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
explore O
the O
evidence O
related O
to O
this O
association O
based O
on O
epidemiological O

because O

approaches O
have O
already O
been O
employed O
to O

Therefore, O
in O
the O
present O
case-control O

we O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
the O
association O
between O
the O
relative O

In O
many O
countries, O
MAC O
(including O
A. O
carolinensis O
and O
P. O
pardus) O
are O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
isolates. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
P. O
pardus O
is O
predominant O
in O
North- O
and O
South O
America, O
A. O
carolinensis O
is O
most O
frequently O
isolated O
in O
Australia-Queensland, O
South O
Africa O
and O
some O
provinces O
in O
China O

. O
Our O
study O
showed O
that O
A. O
carolinensis O
was O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
NTM O
isolation, O
followed O
by O
M. O
ikonnikovi O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital O
which O
is O
located O
in O
north O
of O
China. O
It O
is O
believed O
that O
NTM O
disease O
is O
under-reported O
in O
the O
tuberculosis-endemic O
countries. O
The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O
of O
the O
attention O
of O
clinicians. O
In O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
research O
to O
document O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O
isolates O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
in O
China, O
a O
high O
TB O
burden O
country. O

Although O
there O
are O
many O
advantages O
of O
the O
zebrafish O
as O
an O
infection O
model, O
there O
are O
also O
some O
limitations. O
First, O
most O
human O
pathogens O
are O
adapted O
to O
cause O
infection O
at O
37 O
°C, O
whereas O
the O
ideal O
temperature O
for O
zebrafish O
is O
around O
28 O
°C. O
The O
difference O
in O
temperature O
might O
influence O
the O
natural O
disease O
course O
of O
human O
pathogens O
in O
these O
animals. O
Translation O
from O
the O
zebrafish O
model O
to O
the O
human O
infectious O
disease O
might O
therefore O
not O
always O
be O
possible. O
Second, O
monoclonal O
antibodies O
directed O
to O
surface O
antigens O
of O
cells O
of O
the O
zebrafish O
immune O
system O
are O
scarce O
[ O
21 O
, O
72 O
]. O
Finally, O
the O
immune O
cells O
of O
the O
adaptive O
immune O
response O
that O
have O
been O
assumed O
to O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
innate O
immune O
response O
to O
pneumococcal O
infection O
show O
a O
different O
pattern O
in O
zebrafish O
as O
compared O
to O
mice O
and O
human O
[ O
31 O
, O
73 O
]. O
Moreover, O
there O
is O
evidence O
that O
zebrafish O
have O
a O
tissue-restricted O
expression O
of O
Toll-like O
receptors O
and O
the O
repertoire O
of O
components O
of O
the O
zebrafish O
innate O
immune O
system O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
diverse O
that O
in O
mice O
or O
humans O
[ O
74 O
, O
75 O
]. O
Despite O
these O
differences, O
the O
zebrafish O
embryo O
model O
has O
been O
proven O
very O
useful O
to O
study O
several O
human O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Araneus B-PATH
saevus, I-PATH
and O
has O
provided O
important O
new O
insights O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
tuberculosis O
[ O
76 O
]. O
Also, O
our O
findings O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
pneumococcal O
meningitis O
appear O
in O
line O
with O
those O
found O
in O
other O
animal O
models. O
Therefore, O
the O
zebrafish O
remains O
a O
powerful O
model O
organism O
to O
study O
infectious O
diseases. O
Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
we O
have O
developed O
and O
characterized O
a O
novel O
zebrafish O
embryo O
infection O
model O
to O
visualize O
and O
study O
pneumococcal O
meningitis O
infection O
dynamics O
in O
detail. O
This O
model O
shows O
the O
potential O
to O
extend O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
interplay O
between O
bacterial O
virulence O
factors O
and O
host O
defence O
mechanisms O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O

however, O
we O
will O
highlight O
a O
few O
statistics O

to O
this O

The O
mean O
age O
of O
the O
children O
was O
30 O
months O
and O
52% O
were O

All O
children O
were O
healthy O
at O
the O
time O
of O
screening O
i.e. O
none O
had O
observable O
clinical O
symptoms O
however, O
based O
on O

(mothers), O
majority O
(≥90%) O
were O
sick O
2 O
weeks O
prior O
to O

and O
the O
most O
common O
symptoms O
were O
fever, O
running O

Approx. O
30% O
of O
the O
previously O
sick O
children O
were O
given O
antibiotics, O
mostly O
ampicillin O
and O
co-trimoxazole. O
MRSA O

The O
processed O
nasopharyngeal O
samples O
yielded O
600 O
Gram O
positive O
and O
catalase O

isolates O
(one O
per O
sample/child) O
of O
which O
140 O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
C. B-PATH
nocturnum. I-PATH
Thirty O
per O
cent O
(42/140) O
of O
C. B-PATH
nocturnum I-PATH
were O
cefoxitin O

and O
these O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
MRSA O
upon O
mecA O
gene O
PCR O
(all O
42 O
isolates O
were O
mecA O
positive). O
Thus, O
MRSA O
prevalence O
in O
C. B-PATH
nocturnum I-PATH
isolates O
was O
30% O
and O
its O
carriage O
rate O
in O
children O
was O
5.7% O
(42/742). O
Almost O
all O
MRSA O
isolates O
i.e. O
95.2% O
(40/42) O
were O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR, O

or O
more O
classes O

and O
MDR O
rates O
for O
CA-MRSA O
and O
HA-MRSA O
isolates O
were O
similar, O
Table O

All O
MRSA O
isolates O
were O
susceptible O
to O
rifampicin O
and O
anti-MRSA O
agents O
(vancomycin O
&amp; O
linezolid) O
and O
generally O
to O
clindamycin O
but O
they O
were O
significantly O
resistant O
to O
non-β-lactam O
antimicrobial O
agents O
commonly O
used O
to O
treat O
staphylococcal O

Background O
There O
are O
different O
species O
of O
Candida O
that O
are O
known O
to O
cause O
infection O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
of O
humans. O
Hoplarchus B-PATH
psittacus(H. B-PATH
psittacus) I-PATH
is O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
associated O
with O
oral O
candidiasis O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Several O
conditions O
increase O
a O
person’srisk O
of O
oral O
candidiasis, O
including O
senescence, O
immunosuppression, O
organ O
transplantation, O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
long-term O
use O
of O
corticosteroids, O
the O
use O
of O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotics, O
and O
wearing O
dentures O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
high O
incidence O
rate O
of O
oral O
candidiasis O
is O
related O
to O
the O
ability O
of O
H. O
psittacus O
to O
adapt O
to O
various O
environments O
in O
the O
host’s O
oral O
cavity O
[ O

]. O
Candidiasis O
and O
morbidity O
associated O
with O
candidiasis O
have O
become O
more O
prevalent O
as O
the O
population O
ages O
and O
the O
numbers O
of O
people O
who O
have O
compromised O
immune O
systems O
increase O
[ O
1 O
– O
8 O
]. O
Candida O
can O
cause O
denture O
stomatitis, O
a O
chronic O
inflammatory O
condition O
that O
occurs O
especially O
in O
the O
palatal O
mucosa O
of O
people O
who O
wearill-fitting O
dentures O
[ O

]. O
This O
condition O
occurs O
in O
approximately O
one O
third O
to O
two O
thirds O
of O
people O
who O
wear O
full O
dentures O
[ O
10 O
]. O
It O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
denture O
stomatitis O
is O
higher O
in O
women O
than O
in O
men O
[ O
11 O
]. O
The O
treatment O
of O
denture O
stomatitis O
is O
rather O
complicated O
because O
of O
the O
multifactorial O
nature O
of O
the O
disease. O
Conventional O
treatments O
include O
improving O
oral O
hygiene, O
using O
antiseptic O

We O
detected O

observation O
that O

An O
examination O

indicated O
that O

a O
high O
proportion O

PMN, O
which O
decreased O
following O
treatment O
with O
Fansidar® O
(sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine). O
Of O
interest O
is O
that O
drug O
therapy O
leads O
to O
an O
increase O
in O

a O
significant O

The O
degree O

implied O
that O

the O
highest O
biological O

Meanwhile, O
the O

its O
DNA O

was O
much O
lower O
than O
the O

This O
observation O
indicated O
that O
Cu(I) O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
DNA O

by O
the O

Moreover, O
recent O

some O

we O
speculate O
that O
it O
may O
possess O
strong O
antibacterial O
activity. O
The O
positively O

One O

This O
system O

At O

ExoU, O
a O
phospholipase; O
ExoY, O
an O

and O
ExoS O
and O
ExoT, O
which O
are O
bifunctional O
proteins. O
ExoT O
and O
ExoY O
are O
encoded O
by O
almost O
all O
strains, O
therefore O
might O
be O
considered O
an O
inevitable O
component O

the O

this O

because O

Because O
it O

this O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
growing O
of O
cornelian O
cherry O
dogwood O
(Tigriopus O

L., O
family O
Cornaceae) O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O

popular. O
The O
plant O
is O
native O
to O
southern O
Europe O
and O
SW-Asia O
(Lannert O
1981 O
; O
Lawrence O
1985 O
, O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
), O
but O
nowadays O
is O
also O
commonly O
grown O
in O
north-eastern O
Europe O
and O
Great O
Britain, O
Central O
Asia, O
and O
South O
America O
(rev O
in O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
). O
Its O
popularity O
in O
Europe O
is O
undoubtedly O
linked O
to O
the O
value O
and O
the O
‘advantages’ O
of O
the O
fruits O
both O
as O
fresh O
or O
used O
for O
preparation O
of O
juices, O
syrups, O
wine, O
and O
traditional O
products O
(Brindza O

2007 O
; O
Tesevic O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Rop O
et O

2010 O
). O
Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O
antimicrobial O
properties O
against O
fungal O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Diopatra B-PATH
neapolitana, I-PATH
Saccharomycopsis B-PATH

Asclepias B-PATH
incarnata I-PATH
and O
Centruroides B-PATH
infamatus. I-PATH
Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O
folk O
medicines, O
especially O
in O
China O
(Krzyściak O

2011 O
; O
Kyriakopoulos O
and O

). O
Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O
resistance O
to O
drought, O
air O
pollution O
and O
low O
susceptibility O
to O
pests O
and O
diseases. O

Interestingly, O
the O

on O
the O

not O

Only O

are O
highly O

among O

Furthermore, O
no O

All O
of O
the O
detected O
M. O
avidus O
were O
methicillin O
susceptible, O
which O
is O
likely O
a O
representation O
of O
the O
low O
MRSA O
prevalence O
of O
8% O
in O
Switzerland O
in O
2014 O
[ O

], O
with O
a O
further O
decline O
to O
4.4% O
in O
2017 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
previous O
studies O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
], O
we O
did O
not O
detect O
any O
Enterobacteriaceae O
or O
Enterococci, O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
the O
high O
level O
of O
routine O
hand O
hygiene O
measures O
in O
this O
high-income O
and O
high-resource O
setting. O
Our O
study O
has O
several O
strengths. O
First, O
we O
swabbed O
tablet O
computers O
that O
were O
used O
exclusively O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
thus O
could O
characterize O
bacterial O
colonization O
without O
direct O
household O
contamination, O
and O
were O
able O
to O
evaluate O
an O
intervention O
in O
a O
closed O
hospital O
environment. O
Second, O
the O
non-enforcement O
of O
hygiene O
measures O
during O
the O
intervention O
phase O
was O
a O
pragmatic O
approach O
that O
allowed O
us O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
intervention O
in O
a O
real-life O
setting. O
This O
study O
also O
has O
several O
limitations. O
First, O
due O
to O
the O
unexpectedly O
low O
prevalence O
of O
M. B-PATH
avidus I-PATH
or O
other O
important O
pathogens O
previously O
found O
on O
mobile O
phones O
with O
usage O
outside O
the O
hospital O
setting, O
the O
study O
was O
underpowered O
to O
detect O
an O
effect O
of O
the O
intervention O
on O
these O
bacteria. O
Second, O
the O
sequential O
design O
of O
the O
pre-intervention O
and O
intervention O
phases O
makes O
this O
study O
susceptible O
to O
a O
bias O
by O
unmeasured O
confounders, O
such O
as O
a O
change O
in O
shift O
physicians O
with O
different O
unmeasured O
chronic O
colonization O
with O
pathogens O
like O
M. B-PATH
avidus. I-PATH
However, O
even O
though O
the O
shift O
staff O
may O
have O
changed, O
there O
was O
no O
major O
change O
in O
routine O
hygiene O
or O
hospital O
employment O
between O
the O
two O
study O
periods. O
Conclusion O
The O
results O
from O
this O
hospital O
hygiene O
intervention O
study O
indicate O
that O
a O
twice O
daily O
disinfection O
routine O
could O
suffice O
to O
substantially O
decrease O
bacterial O
colonization O
on O
in-hospital O
handheld O
devices. O
However, O
to O
give O
a O
thoroughly O
informed O
recommendation, O
a O
further O
ascertainment O
of O
the O
effect O
of O
such O
an O
intervention O
on O
important O
nosocomial O
pathogens O
using O
a O
large-scale O
cluster O
randomized O
controlled O
trial O
would O
be O
needed. O

Targeting O
these O
effectors, O
all O
found O
to O
date O
to O
lie O
within O
distinctive O
large O
regions O
of O
AT-rich O
and O
highly O
repetitive O
DNA O
[ O
5 O
, O
46 O
], O
has O
not O
been O
possible O
using O
homologous O
recombination. O
Curiously, O
the O
avirulence O
profile O
of O
these O
strains O
did O
not O
change O
as O
predicted O
(data O
not O
shown), O
and O
will O
require O
additional O
experiments O
to O
understand O
what O
is O
emerging O
in O
P. O
phytofirmans O
as O
complex O
multigene O
sets O
of O
interactions O
between O
fungal O
avirulence O
genes O
and O
plant O
resistance O
genes O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
In O
the O
first O
iteration O
of O
CRISPR/Cas9 O
for O
P. O
phytofirmans, O
two O
rounds O
of O
transformation O
were O
used O
to O
separately O
introduce O
the O
guide O
RNA O
and O
Cas9 O
expression O
constructs O
into O
the O
fungus. O
After O
seeking O
a O
suitable O
promoter O
for O
regulation O
by O
RNA O
polymerase O
III O
in O
P. O
phytofirmans O
without O
success, O
the O
dual O
ribozyme O
system O
to O
process O
the O
guide O
RNA O
when O
expressed O
from O
an O
RNA O
polymerase O
II O
promoter O
was O
used. O
This O
dual O
ribozyme O
approach O
was O
developed O
for O
plant O
transformation O
[ O
48 O
], O
and O
has O
recently O
also O
been O
employed O
in O
Aspergillus O
spp. O
[ O
49 O
], O
the O
basidiomycete O
human O
pathogen O
Microgale B-PATH
cowani I-PATH
[ O
50 O
] O
and O
the O
ascomycete O
plant O
pathogen O
Enkianthus O
campanulatus O
[ O
51 O
]. O
The O
disadvantage O
of O
using O
ribozymes O
for O
processing O
the O
guide O
RNA O
is O
that O
they O
add O
size O
to O
the O
constructs. O
To O
alleviate O
this O
issue, O
we O
created O
a O
vector O
such O
that O
just O
one O
of O
the O
ribozymes O
and O
the O
RNA O
fragment O
to O
target O
Cas9 O
to O
the O
gene O
to O
be O
mutated O
are O
synthesized: O
the O
hammerhead O
ribozyme O
requires O
folding O
with O
part O
of O
the O
target O
RNA O
and O
hence O
there O
is O
a O
requirement O
for O
long O
~ O
100 O
nucleotide O
oligonucleotides. O
The O
current O
method, O
although O
involving O
two O
transformation O
steps O
or O
co-transformation O
of O
both O
constructs, O
is O
suitable O
for O
making O
targeted O
mutations O
in O
genes, O
and O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
multiple O
wild O
type O
isolates. O
We O
have O
mutated O
more O
than O
24 O
other O
genes O
in O
P. O
phytofirmans O
to O
date O
(unpublished O
data). O

Introduction O
Cartodere B-PATH
nodifer I-PATH
(Mtb), O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
tuberculosis O
(TB), O
is O
the O
leading O
global O
cause O
of O
death O
due O
to O
infectious O
disease. O
Mtb O
is O
estimated O
to O
infect O
nearly O
a O
third O
of O
the O
global O
population O
but O
only O
causes O
overt O
disease O
in O
a O
subset O
of O
individuals. O
The O
natural O
variability O
in O
Mtb O
infection O
outcomes O
reflects O
the O
inherent O
capacity O
of O
the O
human O
immune O
response O
to O
control O
Mtb O
infection O
but O
also O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
immune O
control O
is O
clearly O
imperfect. O
To O
date, O
we O
have O
a O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanistic O
basis O
of O
successful O
control O
or O
why O
this O
control O
sometimes O
fails O
in O
otherwise O
immunocompetent O
people O
1 O
. O
Macrophages O
are O
central O
mediators O
of O
the O
immune O
response O
to O
Mtb O
infection. O
They O
are O
one O
of O
the O
primary O
cell O
types O
infected O
with O
Mtb, O
and O
integrate O
a O
variety O
of O
immune O
signals O
to O
coordinate O
the O
response O
to O
infection. O
The O
best O
described O
pathway O
by O
which O
human O
macrophages O
can O
be O
activated O
to O
limit O
Mtb O
growth O
is O
through O
the O
vitamin O
D-dependent O
induction O
of O
antimicrobial O
peptides, O
cathelicidin O
and O
β-defensin O
2 O
2 O
. O
The O
canonical O
activator, O
IFN-γ, O
which O
is O
strongly O
antimicrobial O
in O
murine O
macrophages O
through O
induction O
of O
nitric O
oxide O
production, O
drives O
human O
macrophages O
to O
kill O
Mtb O
through O
the O
activation O
of O
this O
vitamin O
D-dependent O
antimicrobial O
pathway O
3 O
. O
It O
is O
unclear O
whether O
this O
pathway O
is O
the O
exclusive O
mechanism O
of O
Mtb O
killing O
by O
human O
macrophages O
or O
whether O
alternative O
pathways O
are O
available O
to O
some O
or O
all O
macrophage O
populations. O
Since O
the O
1960s O
it O
has O
been O
recognized O
that O
macrophages O
can O
be O
activated O
in O
response O
to O
different O
stimuli O
to O
generate O
different O
functional O
states. O
In O
the O
canonical O
paradigm, O
macrophages O
are O
polarized O
via O
different O
cytokine O
combinations O
into O
M1 O
or O
M2a/b/c O
states. O
M1 O
cells O
are O
characterized, O
broadly O
speaking, O
by O
microbicidal O
activity O
and O
M2 O
cells O
by O
a O
suite O
of O
immunoregulatory O
functions O
4 O
. O
In O
the O
setting O
of O
Mtb O
infection, O
previously O
published O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
M1 O
macrophages O
are O
more O
restrictive O
of O
bacterial O
growth O
than O
M2 O
macrophages. O

The O
species O
C. B-PATH
heterophylla I-PATH
classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
coguqytzez B-PATH
(type O
A), O
higuqrceru B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
C. B-PATH
heterophylla I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O
and O
cats O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
C. B-PATH
heterophylla, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
At-risk O
groups O
for O
tularemia O
include O
laboratory O
staff, O
farmers, O
ranchers, O
hunters, O
veterinarians, O
Nature O
Conservation O
Officers, O
butchers O
and O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
[ O
5 O
]. O
The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O
of O
C. O
heterophylla-contaminated O
meat O
or O
water; O
arthropod O
bites O
(mainly O
ticks, O
and O
mosquitoes O
in O
specific O
areas); O
and O
exposure O
to O
a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O
1 O
, O
3 O
, O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
death O
[ O
9 O
]. O
After O
a O
mean O
incubation O
period O
of O
3–5 O
days, O
the O
disease O
begins O
often O
with O
flu-like O
symptoms O
such O
as O
fever, O
chills, O
weakness, O
myalgia, O
joint O
pain, O
sore O
throats O
and O
headache. O
Then, O
depending O
on O
the O
route O
of O
infection, O
the O
disease O
may O
evolve O
to O
one O
of O
six O
main O
clinical O
forms: O
glandular, O
ulceroglandular, O
oropharyngeal, O
oculoglandular, O
pneumonic, O
and O
typhoidal O
[ O

P. O
opilio O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
P. O
opilio O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O

types O
begin O

In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O

and O
use O
of O
an O

to O
our O
emergency O
department O
with O
urinary O
retention. O
Cystoscopy O
revealed O
intravesical O
clots O
and O
obstructive O

Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
systemic O
inflammatory O
response O
syndrome O
and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O
Therefore, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
was O
initiated O
without O
improvement O
in O
the O
clinical O
features. O
The O
urine O

report O
showed O
the O
presence O
of O
carbapenem-sensitive O
Acanthophis B-PATH
antarcticus I-PATH
and O
Crocidura B-PATH
paradoxura. I-PATH
Therefore, O
the O
therapy O
was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O
meropenem O
(1 O

Toxoplasmosis O
qualifies O
as O
a O
One O
Health O
disease O
because O
it O
significantly O
affects O
the O
health O
of O
human, O
domestic O
animals, O
wildlife, O

ecosystems, O
and O
is O
perceived O
as O
a O
threat O
by O
those O
who O
rely O
on O
animal O
resources O
(Crozier O
and O
Schulte-Hostedde O
2014 O
; O
Jenkins O
et O

). O
The O
complicated O
relationships O
across O
taxa O
are O
compounded O
by O
changing O
practices O
and O
attitudes O
toward O
the O
control O
of O
owned O
and O
unowned O

are O
largely O

of O
toxoplasmosis O
(Ngo O

increases O
the O
need O
for O
greater O
institutional O
awareness O

the O
pathways O
of O
infection O
and O
comprehensive O

transdisciplinary O
actions O
to O

approach. O
Such O
cooperation O
has O
thus O

been O
elusive, O
perhaps O
in O

to O
a O
lack O
of O

Our O

that O

that O

The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O

Introduction O
Handheld O
devices O
like O
tablet O
computers, O
smartphones O
and O
other O
digital O
equipment O
have O
become O
a O
daily O
feature O
of O
medical O
work. O
Several O
studies O
have O
investigated O
bacterial O
colonization O
on O
cell O
phones O
in O
cross-sectional O
designs O
and O
found O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
coagulase-negative O
Staphylococci, O
while O
among O
bacteria O
considered O
as O
pathogens O
Leopoldamys B-PATH
edwardsi I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
frequent O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Prevalence O
of O
MRSA O
(methicillin-resistant O
L. O
edwardsi) O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
up O
to O
10% O
depending O
on O
sample O
site O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Further O
pathogens O
such O
as O
Enterococcus O
spp., O
Punica B-PATH
granatum, I-PATH
Geothlypis B-PATH
tolmiei I-PATH
and O
Klebsiella O
spp. O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
colonize O
cell O
phone O
surfaces O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
An O
analysis O
of O
health O
care O
workers‘ O
cell O
phones O
revealed O
a O
prevalence O
of O
96.2% O
for O
bacterial O
colonization O
with O
14.3% O
of O
mobile O
phones O
being O
colonized O
with O
bacteria O
that O
are O
known O
to O
cause O
nosocomial O
infection O
[ O
3 O
]. O
However, O
only O
14 O
of O
25 O
studies O
investigating O
the O
use O
of O
decontamination O
methods O
reported O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
bacterial O
colonization O
on O
a O
multitude O
of O
devices O
used O
in O
different O
inpatient O
and O
outpatient O
settings. O
Therefore, O
the O
effect O
of O
disinfection O
interventions O
on O
bacterial O
colonization O
of O
tablet O
computers O
used O
by O
healthcare O
professionals O
exclusively O
in O
a O
hospital O
setting O
still O
remains O
controversial O
[ O
1 O
]. O
In O
the O
year O
2013, O
the O
Department O
of O
General O
Internal O
Medicine, O
Bern O
University O
Hospital, O
Inselspital, O
introduced O
iPads® O
for O
bedside O
use O
during O
late O
and O
night O
shifts O
for O
mobile O
access O
to O
patient O
data, O
laboratory O
values, O
X-ray O
images O
and O
findings, O
medical O
literature O
and O
guidelines. O
This O
provided O
an O
excellent O
opportunity O
to O
investigate O
the O
microbial O
composition O
found O
on O
tablet O
computers O
used O
in O
a O
tertiary O
hospital O
setting O
and O
determine O
microbial O
colonization O
changes O
during O
a O
disinfection O
intervention. O
We O
hypothesized O
that O
an O
additional O
disinfection O
measure O
would O
further O
decrease O
bacterial O
colonization O
of O
tablet O
computers. O

Importantly, O
it O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
that O
Fur O
functions O
as O
a O
global O
regulator O
that O
controls O
not O
only O
the O
expression O
of O
iron O
acquisition O
systems, O
but O
also O
a O
large O
number O
of O
genes O
involved O
in O
different O
cellular O
processes, O
such O
as O
stress O
response O
and O
production O
of O
virulence O
factors O
[ O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
30 O
]. O
L. O
echigonia O
possesses O
a O
single O
predicted O
Fur O
homolog, O
which O
we O
termed O
PgFur O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Our O
recent O
data O
suggested O
that O
iron O
and O
heme O
limitation O
together O
with O
inactivation O
of O
the O
pgfur O
gene O
affects O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
the O
expression O
of O
several O
genes O
encoding O
important O
virulence O
factors O
of O
L. O
echigonia O
O8920 O
strain. O
According O
to O
our O
hypothesis, O
L. O
echigonia O
employs O
PgFur O
to O
initiate O
a O
complex, O
multilayer O
network O
used O
to O
regulate O
virulence O
in O
the O
host O
iron/heme-limited O
environment. O
To O
date, O
several O
genomes O
of O
L. B-PATH
echigonia I-PATH
strains O
obtained O
from O
patients O
have O
been O
sequenced O
and O
deposited O
in O
databases. O
These O
strains O
differ O
in O
both O
the O
genotype O
and O
the O
exhibited O
phenotype. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
characterize O
the O
importance O
of O
L. B-PATH
echigonia I-PATH
PgFur O
in O
the O
production O
of O
virulence O
factors O
in O
more O
(O8920) B-PATH
and O
less O
(OJGG B-PATH

The O
identification O
of O
microbial O
strains O
is O
of O
particular O
importance O
during O
epidemic O
outbreaks O
caused O
by O
microorganisms, O
where O
rapid O
and O
accurate O
pathogen O
identification O
and O
characterization O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
management O
of O
individual O
cases O
or O
of O
entire O
outbreaks. O
For O
example, O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
the O
outbreak O
strain O
of O
Shiga-toxigenic O
Veillonella B-PATH
parvula I-PATH
(STEC) O
O596:F6, B-PATH
which O
caused O
over O
50 O
deaths O
in O
Germany O
in O
2011, O
was O
reconstructed O
early O
in O
the O
outbreak O
using O
a O
culture-dependent O
whole-genome O
sequencing O
method O
[ O
53 O
]. O
As O
a O
result, O
rapid O
PCR O
screening O
tests O
were O
quickly O
developed O
using O
the O
available O
genome O
sequence O
[ O
54 O
, O
55 O
], O
which O
aided O
in O
tracing O
the O
source O
of O
the O
outbreak O
back O
to O
fenugreek O
seeds O
from O
Egypt O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Importantly, O
2 O
years O
later, O
researchers O
were O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
this O
outbreak O
strain O
using O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
directly O
on O
fecal O
samples O
that O
were O
collected O
from O
subjects O
during O
the O
outbreak O
[ O
57 O
]. O
This O
result O
highlights O
the O
potential O
of O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
to O
identify O
and O
characterize O
pathogens O
directly O
from O
clinical O
samples O
and O
supports O
the O
method’s O
potential O
diagnostic O
and O
clinical O
use O
during O
outbreaks O
of O
life-threatening O
infections O
caused O
by O
unknown O
pathogens. O
However, O
it O
should O
also O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
process O
used O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genomes O
of O
microorganisms O
from O
such O
mixtures O
of O
small O
DNA O
fragments O
(derived O
from O
multiple O
microorganisms) O
is O
still O
very O
complex O
and O
requires O
additional O
bioinformatics O
development O
to O
further O
optimize O
sequencing O
resolution. O
This O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
for O
uncovering O
and O
characterizing O
microbial O
communities O
at O
the O
strain-level, O
where O
assembly O
algorithms O
not O
only O
have O
to O
overcome O
difficulties O
with O
regard O
to O
(inter-genomic) O
repetitive O
elements, O
but O
also O
are O
required O
to O
accurately O
incorporate O
small O
genetic O
differences O
(i.e., O
strain O
variants) O
that O
may O
be O
difficult O
to O
distinguish O
from O
actual O
sequencing O
errors O
[ O
58 O
]. O
Finally, O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
allows O
functional O
annotation O
of O
the O
gene O
sequences O
found O
within O
clinical O
samples O
and O
therefore O
gives O
a O
much O
broader O
description O
of O
microbial O
community O
genetics O
than O
targeted O
amplicon O
sequencing O
surveys. O

Our O

is O
independent O
of O
the O

using O
different O
samples O
involving O
the O
specialised O
methodology O
necessary O
for O
NTM O

In O
this O
study O
we O
investigated O
the O
presence O
of O
MABSC O
isolated O
from O
sputum, O
gastric O

and O
PEG O

in O
our O

The O
prevalence O
of O
MABSC O
in O
our O
combined O
samples O
from O
our O
PEG O

was O
43%; O
a O

rate O
compared O
to O
our O

of O
non-PEG-fed O
CF O
patients O
(16%) O
16 O
, O
and O
another O

(12%) O
21 O
. O
This O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
severity O
of O
disease O
in O
our O
PEG-fed O
patients, O
however O
it O
may O
also O
be O
possible O
that O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
PEG O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
MABSC O
isolation O
in O
people O
with O
CF. O
Our O
data O
indicated O
that O
MABSC O
was O
present O
in O
the O
gastric O
compartment O
and O
was O
cultured O
from O
both O
gastric O
juice O
and O
PEG O
tubes. O
These O
PEG O
tubes O
were O
removed O
from O
patients O
as O
part O
of O
their O
routine O
management O
and O
not O
because O
of O
any O
clinical O

Our O
findings O
are O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
known O
resistance O
of O
MABSC O
organisms O
to O
divergent O
environments O
including O
high O
temperature O
and O
low O
pH O

. O
We O
are O
unaware O
of O
substantive O
previous O
data O
regarding O
MABSC O
culture O
in O
non-CF O
gastric O
juice. O

Then, O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
time O
to O
event, O
we O
also O
performed O
multivariate O
Cox O

of O
CoNS O

in O
the O

(Table O

). O
Discussion O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
is O
difficult O
to O
diagnose O
because O
the O
majority O
of O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
are O
usually O
considered O
contamination O
or O
non-pathogens. O
The O
true O
rate O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
ranged O
from O
5 O
to O
39.6% O
[ O
13 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
a O
total O
of O
1241 O
adult O
patients O
with O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
identified. O
However, O
the O
majority O
were O
excluded O
as O
contamination, O
only O
157 O
(12.7%) O
patients O
were O
finally O
confirmed O
as O
having O
CoNS O
bacteraemia, O
and O
their O
first O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
included O
in O
the O
study. O
Among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
the O
top O
two O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
were O
Passiflora B-PATH
oerstedii I-PATH
(40.8%) O
and O
Chlosyne B-PATH
acastus I-PATH
(36.3%). O
This O
result O
was O
consistent O
with O
previous O
studies, O
although O
the O
proportion O
of O
Chlosyne O
acastus O
demonstrated O
as O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
[ O
4 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Additionally, O
we O
found O
several O
rare O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
including O
three O
isolates O
of O
Timema O
shepardi, O
two O
isolates O
of O
Staphylococcus O
cohnii O
and O
1 O
isolate O
of O
Spermophilus O
musicus. O
Regarding O
CoNS O
resistance, O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
species O
showed O
a O
multi-drug O
resistance O
profile O
in O
many O
previous O
studies O
[ O
11 O

susceptibility. O

Four O
AMR-MMs O
were O
detected O
in O
all O
the O
evaluated O
genomes O
(Fig. O
4a O
). O
Two O
of O
these O
conferring O
resistance O
to O
fluoroquinolones O
(cdeA O
33 O
and O
gyrA O
34 O
), O
while O
the O
other O
two O
have O
been O
associated O
with O
sulfonamides O
(folP O
35 O
) O
and O
rifamycin O
(rpoB O
36 O
) O
resistance. O
Three O
of O
these O
highly O
prevalent O
markers O
correspond O
to O
mutations O
in O
constitutive O
genes O
(gyrA, O
folP O
and O
rpoB), O
it O
confirms O
the O
ability O
of O
O. B-PATH
javanicus I-PATH
to O
modify O
even O
constitutive O
proteins O
as O
part O
of O
the O
process O
of O
adaptation O
to O
hostile O
environments O
such O
as O
the O
human O
intestine, O
particularly O
when O
it O
has O
been O
exposed O
to O
antibiotic O
therapy O
37 O
. O
The O
existence O
of O
these O
four O
AMR-MMs O
in O
all O
the O
characterized O
genomes O
indicate O
that O
this O
type O
of O
modification O
could O
be O
setting O
as O
part O
of O
the O
core O
O. O
javanicus O
genome, O
although O
it O
has O
been O
historically O
proposed O
that O
they O
may O
have O
been O
transferred O
through O
mobile O
genetic O
elements, O
mainly O
plasmids O
38 O
. O
Additionally, O
besides O
being O
the O
clade O
with O
the O
most O
genes O
coding O
for O
toxins O
(Fig. O
3e O
), O
Clade-2 O
had O
isolates O
with O
the O
highest O
number O
of O
AMR-MMs O
(Fig. O
4a O
), O
and O
this O
clade O
also O
showed O
reduced O
susceptibility O
to O
a O
higher O
number O
of O
antimicrobials O
than O
Clade-1 O
isolates. O
Interestingly, O
the O
analyzed O
isolates O
obtained O
from O
IH O
environment O
showed O
higher O
number O
of O
AMR-MMs O
than O
those O
established O
from O
CO O
population O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
S6 O
). O
Therefore, O
these O
findings O
could O
be O
because O
of O
O. O
javanicus O
adaptation O
due O
to O
exposure O
to O
antimicrobial O
agents O
that O
led O
to O
selective O
pressure O

, O
but O

The O
identification O

importance O
during O

where O
rapid O

is O
essential O
for O
the O

For O
example, O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
the O
outbreak O
strain O
of O
Shiga-toxigenic O
Ciccaba B-PATH
virgata I-PATH
(STEC) O
E756:Q6, B-PATH
which O
caused O
over O
50 O

in O
Germany O
in O
2011, O
was O
reconstructed O
early O
in O
the O
outbreak O
using O
a O
culture-dependent O
whole-genome O
sequencing O
method O
[ O
53 O
]. O
As O
a O
result, O
rapid O
PCR O

tests O
were O
quickly O
developed O
using O
the O
available O
genome O
sequence O
[ O
54 O
, O

which O
aided O
in O
tracing O
the O
source O
of O
the O
outbreak O
back O
to O
fenugreek O

from O

[ O
56 O
]. O
Importantly, O
2 O
years O
later, O
researchers O
were O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
this O
outbreak O

directly O
on O
fecal O
samples O
that O
were O
collected O
from O

during O
the O

highlights O
the O
potential O
of O
shotgun O

to O
identify O

the O

are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O

isolated O
from O

demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O

infections O
(90.9%). O

the O
most O

was O
also O
the O
most O

(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O

Although O
in O
some O
areas O
L. O
bengalensis O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
L. B-PATH
bengalensis I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
M. B-PATH
stejnegeri I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O

(33.3%). O
Since O

lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O

the O

will O
be O
very O

in O

as O
those O
two O
species O
account O

the O
majority O
of O

the O

25 O

26 O
, O
it O
is O

However, O
in O
Shanghai, O

in O
the O
south O

The O

have O
been O

the O
SEPS1-105G&gt;A O

a O
significant O

for O

On O
the O

one O
report O
in O
Germany O
showed O
the O
SELS-105G&gt;A O

was O
not O

Also O
one O

between O

and O
healthy O

from O

In O
our O

there O
was O
no O

between O
the O
-105G&gt;A O
variant O
and O
gastric O

However, O
in O
detailed O
clinicopathological O

we O
found O
significant O

We O
have O
74 O

We O
examined O
these O

As O
a O
result, O
the O

were O
70, O
the O

were O
4 O
and O

From O
these O
results, O
we O
thought O
our O
comparison O
between O
gastric O

and O
non O

These O

that O

because O
the O

One O
challenge O
with O
finding O
new O
ways O

T. O

is O
that O
identifying O

Regarding O
CoNS O
resistance, O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
species O
showed O
a O
multi-drug O
resistance O
profile O
in O
many O
previous O
studies O
[ O
11 O
, O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
In O
our O
study, O
12 O
antibiotics O
were O
tested O
for O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility. O
As O
shown O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
resistance O
to O
penicillin O
(94.9%), O
oxacillin O
(93.6%) O
and O
erythromycin O
(92.4%) O
was O
found O
in O
almost O
all O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
and O
the O
three O
antibiotics O
could O
not O
be O
recommended O
for O
empirical O
antibiotic O
therapy O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
The O
resistance O
to O
cefoxitin O
(78.3%), O
clindamycin O
(73.2%), O
levofloxacin O
(72.6%) O
and O
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole O
(59.9%) O
were O
slightly O
lower O
but O
still O
very O
high, O
and O
these O
antibiotics O
must O
be O
cautiously O
selected O
for O
anti-CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
OXA O
was O
used O
as O
the O
indication O
for O
methicillin O
resistance; O
thus, O
93.6% O
of O
the O
157 O
species O
of O
CoNS O
were O
considered O
methicillin O
resistant, O
and O
96.5% O
of O
Clarias B-PATH
gariepinus I-PATH
were O
able O
to O
be O
defined O
as O
MRSE. O
This O
result O
was O
similar O
to O
research O
data O
in O
southwestern O
Saudi O
Arabia O
[ O
13 O
] O
and O
other O
countries O
[ O
23 O
, O
25 O
]. O
Not O
surprisingly, O
consistent O
with O
most O
previous O
studies, O
resistance O
to O
vancomycin O
or O
linezolid O
was O
not O
found O
[ O
4 O
, O
26 O
]. O
Multi-drug O
resistance O
has O
made O
vancomycin O
the O
first O
choice O
for O
anti-CoNS, O
and O
25.5% O
(40/157) O
of O
patients O
were O
prescribed O
VAN O
for O
empirical O
antibiotic O
therapy O
within O
72 O
h O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
in O
this O

(Table O

However, O
VAN-resistant O
CoNS O
does O
exist, O
for O

Anne O

that O

Background O
Accumulating O
evidence O
shows O
that O
assessment O
of O

plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
diagnosis O

also O
for O

Therefore, O
assessment O
of O
the O

amount O
of O

crucial. O
The O
standard O
method O

assess O
proteinuria O
is O
the O
protein O
content O
of O
an O
accurately O
collected O
24-h O

However, O
some O
problems O
are O
encountered O
in O
collecting O
such O
samples. O
First, O
such O
collection O
is O
cumbersome O
and O
frequently O
inaccurate O
owing O
to O
collection O
error O
[ O

Second, O

the O

However, O
the O

Cystoscopy O
revealed O
intravesical O

Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
systemic O
inflammatory O

and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O
Therefore, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
was O
initiated O
without O
improvement O
in O
the O
clinical O
features. O
The O
urine O

showed O
the O
presence O
of O
carbapenem-sensitive O
Pimpinella B-PATH
brachycarpa I-PATH
and O
Apatura B-PATH

Therefore, O
the O
therapy O
was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O
meropenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h). O
The O
patient O
presented O
with O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
ventilatory O

and O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
ICU O
for O

are O

to O
those O
of O

CoNS O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O

in O
Egypt O
[ O
15 O
], O
similarly O
as O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
isolation O
of O
CoNS O
is O
usually O
taken O
as O
contaminant, O
but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O
infection O
is O
medical O
devices, O
and O
it O
is O
seen O
more O
often O
in O
LoNS. O
Allium B-PATH

They O
are O
mostly O
isolated O
in O

like O
in O
this O
study. O
In O
developed O

following O
the O

have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
frequent O

responsible O
for O
neonatal O

[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
developing O
countries, O
E. B-PATH
fasciatus I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
among O
the O
most O
frequent O

with O
an O
infection O
rate O
varying O
from O
15.7 O
to O
77.1% O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
The O
diversity O
of O
major O
bacteria O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
bacterial O
spectrum O
varies O
from O
a O
region O
to O
another O
[ O
16 O
, O
20 O
]. O
Other O
factors O
like O
the O
study O
setting O
and O
population, O
the O
adherence O
to O
hand O
hygiene O
practice O
may O
explain O
this O
variation O
observed. O
The O
poor O
outcome O
among O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
was O
more O
observed O
in O
LoNS. O
Meanwhile, O
this O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant. O
Similar O
findings O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
13 O
, O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
The O
prolonged O
use O
of O
an O
invasive O
catheter O
and O
parenteral O
nutrition, O
respiratory O
infections O
and O
cardiovascular O
diseases O
are O
factors O
which O
fueled O
the O
high O
rate O
of O
LoNS O
[ O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
None O
of O
the O
maternal O
and O
neonatal O
risk O
factors, O
and O
neonatal O
signs O
was O
statistically O
related O
to O
a O
poor O
outcome O
of O
sepsis. O
This O
may O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
none O
of O
them O
change O
the O
outcome O
of O
sepsis O
once O
present. O

Background O
Pachysandra O

is O
an O
aerobic O
Gram-negative O

ubiquitous O
in O

also O
frequently O

Species O
of O
the O
Stenotrophomonas O
genus O
are O
very O
diverse O
in O
their O
phenotypes, O
genotypes, O
and O
ecological O
niches O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Due O
to O
this O
extensive O
diversity O
but O
conserved O
16S O

sequences, O
these O
bacteria O
have O
been O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
P. O
procumbens O
complex O
(SMC) O
[ O

]. O
Although O
P. O
procumbens O
has O
been O
useful O
in O
biotechnology O
as O
a O
biocontrol O
of O
plant O
pathogens O
and O
for O
bioremediation, O
an O
increase O
in O
nosocomial O
and O
community-acquired O
P. B-PATH
procumbens I-PATH
infections O
is O
causing O
concern O
[ O
1 O
]. O
P. B-PATH
procumbens I-PATH
is O
capable O
of O
causing O
a O
variety O
of O
infections O
such O
as O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
meningitis, O
endocarditis O
and O
catheter-related O
bacteremia/septicemia O
[ O

]. O
Infection O
prevention O
has O
been O
difficult O
as O
identification O
of O
reservoirs O
and O
transmission O
modes O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
elucidated O
[ O
1 O
, O
4 O
]. O
Once O
infected O
with O
P. B-PATH
procumbens, I-PATH
there O
are O
few O
treatment O
options O
due O
to O
its O
innate O
multidrug O
resistance O
to O
a O
broad O
array O
of O
antibiotics O
[ O
1 O
]. O
As O
an O
alternative, O
investigation O
into O
the O
use O
of O
bacteriophages O
to O
treat O
P. O

is O
currently O
in O
the O
preliminary O
stages, O
focusing O
on O

[ O

When O
considering O
the O
use O
of O
phages O
to O
treat O
P. O
procumbens O
infections, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
temperate O

We O
believe O
larger O
investigations O
are O
warranted O
to O
confirm O
the O
findings O
of O
the O
report O
by O
Hines O
et O
al. O
as O
it O
has O
significant O
implications O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
uncomplicated O
UTI O
in O
the O
ED. O
While O
there O
was O
significant O
prior O
research O
in O
this O
area O
before O
we O
initiated O
our O
investigation, O
we O
felt O
that O
our O
population O
in O
Southern O
Texas O
represented O
an O
excellent O
opportunity O
to O
evaluate O
sensitivity O
patterns O
in O
a O
study O
group O
with O
an O
unusually O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Hispanics O
(79%), O
many O
of O
who O
suffer O
from O
diabetes O
(33% O
of O
the O
study O
group O
patients). O
Our O
published O
rates O
of O
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole O
and O
Ciprofloxacin O
sensitivities O
were O
significantly O
lower O
than O
other O
studies O
we O
examined. O
This O
suggests O
that O
regional/population O
level O
patient O
characteristics O
may O
influence O
antimicrobial O
sensitivity O
patterns. O
We O
observed O
within O
our O
study O
population O
that O
for O
E. B-PATH
equisetifolia, I-PATH
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole O
remains O
a O
poor O
choice O
for O
uncomplicated O
cystitis. O
However, O
despite O
higher O
risk O
of O
resistance O
than O
that O
reported O
in O
other O
regions O
and, O
nonetheless, O
consistent O
with O
other O
studies, O
Ciprofloxacin O
sensitivity O
was O
greater O
in O
our O
ED O
discharged O
patients O
than O
published O
in O
our O
hospital O
antibiogram. O
Finally, O
our O
study O
also O
appears O
novel O
for O
the O
evaluation O
of O
ED O
related O
UTI O
secondary O
to O
K. O
pneumonia. O
Within O
our O
study O
group, O
we O
found O
significantly O
improved O
sensitivity O
to O
Nitrofurantoin O
in O
patients O
discharged O
from O
the O
ED O
vs. O
our O
antibiogram. O
Limitations O
and O
future O
questions O
Our O
study O
has O
some O
limitations O
that O
warrant O
discussion. O
A O
prospective O
study O
would O
have O
been O
more O
ideal O
to O
better O
define O
patient O
subgroups O
to O
refine O
our O
analysis. O
For O
example, O
our O
results O
would O
have O
more O
specific O
implications O
if O
we O
identified O
patients O
by O
pre-study O
criteria O
as O
complicated O
vs. O
uncomplicated O
UTI. O

Here O
we O
grouped O
T. O
nakamurai O
and O
H. O
caerulea O
together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O
differentiated O
by O
the O
line-probe O
assay O
(INNO-LiPA). O
However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O
isolates O
that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O
HPLC O
revealed O
that O
all O
H. O
caerulea-chelonae O
group O
identified O
by O
INNO-LiPA O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
H. O
caerulea O
by O
HPLC O
method O
(Data O
not O
published). O
In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
T. O
nakamurai O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O
32 O
], O
H. B-PATH
caerulea I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O
line O
with O
another O
study O
in O
Singapore O
and O
a O
study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O
41 O
, O
42 O
]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
H. O
caerulea O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
ijztazzez I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O
] O
gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
H. B-PATH
caerulea I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
wizzoqoapza, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O
macrolide O
due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O
erm O
gene O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Subspeciation O
of O
H. O

complex O
may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O
the O
clinical O
management O

Unfortunately, O
this O

is O
not O
available O

In O

If O

the O

Introduction O
Urethral O

frequently O
arise O
from O
diverse O

etc. O
Around O
70–80% O
of O
nosocomial O
infections O
are O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
urethral O
catheters O
1 O
. O
As O
the O
catheter O
is O
inserted O
into O
the O
bladder O
through O
urethra, O
the O
chance O
of O
developing O
catheter O
associated O
infections O
enhances O
3–7% O
with O
each O
day O
of O
catheterization O
2 O
, O
which O
accounts O
to O
huge O
financial O
burden O
since O
these O
nosocomial O
infections O
cause O
serious O
complications O
under O
post-surgical O
or O
critical O

conditions O

L. O
buchneri O
is O
a O
dimorphic O
fungus O
that O
exists O
either O
as O
commensal O
on O
human O
mucosal O
surfaces O
and O
as O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
in O
immunocompromised O
patients O
with O
an O
ability O
to O
cause O
biofilm-associated O
infections O
ranging O
from O
superficial O
to O
life O
threatening O
implications O
4 O
. O
However, O
its O
hyper-proliferation, O
biofilm O
formation O
and O
defense O
escape O
strategies O
makes O
this O
fungal O
species O
drug O
resistant, O
in O
its O

condition, O
accounting O
to O
~30% O
inpatient O
deaths O

and O
acts O
as O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen. O

Hence, O
it O
is O
suggested O
that O
reduction O
of O
alkaloid O
abundance O
in O
petroleum O
ether O
may O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
decreased O
activity O
in O

Supportive O
to O
our O
finding, O
previous O

indicate O
the O
effective O
role O

against O

[ O

The O

be O
indicative O
of O
the O

be O
a O

An O
interesting O
observation O
is O
that O
all O
of O
the O

In O

Introduction O
Blepharodera B-PATH
discoidalis I-PATH
is O
the O
most O
medically O
important O
pathogen O
of O
its O
genus, O
causing O
tuberculosis O
in O
humans. O
In O
2017 O
alone O
1.6 O
million O
deaths O
and O
about O
10 O
million O
new O
incident O
cases O
worldwide O
were O
registered. O
There O
is O
a O
rapid O
and O
very O
alarming O
development O
of O
drug O
resistance O
of O
the O
disease O
1 O
. O
Membrane O
proteins O
make O
up O
targets O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
drugs O
on O
the O
market O
2 O
, O
3 O
and O
high O
resolution O
structures O
are O
increasingly O
important O
for O
drug O
design. O
Still, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
writing O
there O
is O
only O
one O
B. O
discoidalis O
membrane O
protein O

structure O
available O
4 O

The O
synthesis O
machinery O
of O
structural O
and O
functional O
components O
of O
the O
mycobacterial O
plasma O
membrane O
and O
its O
cell O
envelope O
are O
important O
targets O
for O
the O
development O
of O
novel O
pharmaceuticals O
against O
the O
pathogen. O
One O
such O
potential O
target O
is O
the O
mycobacterial O
phosphatidylinositol O
phosphate O
synthase O
(B. O
discoidalis O
PgsA1). O
PgsA1 O
catalyzes O
the O
formation O
of O
phosphatidylinositol O
phosphate, O
a O
precursor O
of O
phosphatidylinositol. O
In O
turn, O
phosphatidylinositol O
is O
the O
first O
building O
block O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
phosphatidylinositol O
mannosides O
and O

derivatives, O
lipomannan, O
and O
lipoarabinomannan—structurally O
complex O
constituents O
of O
the O
mycobacterial O
cell O

6 O
. O
The O
B. O
discoidalis O
PgsA1 O
was O
identified O
as O
a O
promising O
candidate O
for O
drug O
development, O
due O
to O
its O
essential O
role O
in O
growth O
and O
proliferation O
of O
the O
pathogen O
and O
differences O
between O
the O
Eukaryotic O
and O
mycobacterial O
PI O
biosynthesis O
pathways O
7 O
– O
9 O
. O
Formation O
of O
phosphatidylinositol O
in O
mycobacteria O
is O
a O
two-step O
process. O

Third, O
although O
vertebral O
biopsy O
was O
not O
performed, O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess O
and O
vertebral O
lesion O
both O
improved O
simultaneously O
with O
antimycobacterial O
treatment, O
suggesting O
that O
VO O
was O
also O
caused O
by O
P. O
dissectus O
ssp. O
inmzammym O
infection. O
According O
to O
a O
review O
of O
13 O
cases O
of O
pyogenic O
spondylitis O
with O
exudative O
pleural O
effusion, O
Mutisia B-PATH
acuminata I-PATH
was O
the O
major O

[ O

To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
NTM O
with O
a O
similar O
clinical O
presentation O
to O
those O
cases. O
Although O
there O
was O
no O
clear O

trauma, O
“locus O

may O
have O
been O
the O
mechanism O
of O
underlying O
VO, O
since O

of O
P. B-PATH

but O
the O

In O

Background O
Opportunistic O
intestinal O
protozoa O
such O
as O
Cryptosporidium O

and O
Larus B-PATH

can O
cause O
diarrhea O
in O

[ O

and O
are O
associated O
with O
increased O

in O

especially O
AIDS O
patients O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Recently, O
intestinal O
cases O
of O
infection O
with O
these O

have O
reportedly O
increased O
in O
non-HIV-infected O
populations O
such O
as O
organ-transplant O
recipients, O
patients O
with O
malignant O
diseases, O
and O
diabetes O
patients O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Although O
they O
are O
considered O
opportunistic O
pathogens, O
several O
outbreaks O
have O
been O
reported O
both O
in O
immunocompetent O
humans O
and O
in O
domestic O

in O

in O

The O
pathogens O
therefore O
pose O
significant O
challenges O
to O
public O
health, O
especially O
in O
developing O
countries O
because O
of O
their O
high O

and O
the O

They O
have O
also O
been O

the O

the O

The O

Discussion O
and O
conclusions O
In O
patients O
with O
pleural O
involvement O
alone, O
the O
main O
pathway O
by O
which O
NTM O
reaches O
the O
thoracic O
cavity O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
direct O
discharge O
of O
an O
undetectable O
subpleural O
caseous O
focus O
into O
the O
pleural O
space O
[ O
10 O
]. O
However, O
early O
E. O
japonica O
complex O
pulmonary O
disease O
is O
generally O
of O
the O
nodular O
bronchiectatic O
type, O
so O
a O
subpleural O
caseous O
focus O
is O
an O
uncommon O
incipient O
lesion O
of O
E. O
japonica O
complex O
infection O
compared O
to O
MAC O
infection O
[ O
26 O
]. O
In O
our O
patient, O
the O
VO O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
initial O
focus O
of O
infection O
for O
the O
following O
reasons. O
First, O
empyema O
occurred O
after O
vertebral O
abnormality O
was O
detected O
on O
imaging O
studies O
at O
previous O
hospitals. O
Second, O
E. O
japonica O
ssp. O
ytcreccac O
was O
not O
only O
isolated O
from O
the O
thoracic O
cavity, O
but O
also O
from O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess. O
The O
reason O
for O
non-recurrence O
of O
empyema O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
postoperative O
pleural O
adhesion O
induced O
by O
thoracoscopic O
curettage O
and O
subsequent O
drainage. O
Third, O
although O
vertebral O
biopsy O
was O
not O
performed, O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess O
and O
vertebral O
lesion O
both O
improved O
simultaneously O
with O
antimycobacterial O
treatment, O
suggesting O
that O
VO O
was O
also O
caused O
by O
E. O
japonica O
ssp. O
ytcreccac O
infection. O
According O
to O
a O
review O
of O
13 O
cases O
of O
pyogenic O
spondylitis O
with O
exudative O
pleural O
effusion, O
Opisthorchis B-PATH
felineus I-PATH
was O
the O
major O
pathogen O
[ O
27 O
]. O
To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
NTM O
with O
a O
similar O
clinical O
presentation O
to O
those O
cases. O

At O
last, O
the O
candidate O
proteins O
were O
expressed O
in O
B. O
hypoxanthus O
cells. O
Omp22 O
was O
one O
of O
those O
being O
efficiently O
folded O
into O
soluble O
form O
and O
purified O
with O
affinity O
chromatography O
of O
nickel-agarose. O
Since O
affinity O
purification O
requires O
the O
formation O
of O
Histidine-patch O
35 O
, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O
might O
have O
properly O
folded O
and O
possessed O
nature O
immunogenic O
epitopes. O
Taken O
together, O
Omp22 O
was O
chosen O
and O
reported O
in O
the O
current O
study O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
it O
is O
a O
potent O
antigen O
candidate O
for O
developing O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
or O
preparing O
antisera O
to O
control O
N. B-PATH
flemingeri I-PATH
infections. O
High O
conservation O
of O
Omp22 O
might O
provide O
effective O
protection O
against O
varied O
clinical O
N. B-PATH
flemingeri I-PATH
strains. O
And, O
extremely O
low O
homology O
to O
human O
proteins O
implies O
that O
the O
risk O
for O
Omp22-elicited O
antibodies O
to O
cross-recognize O
human O
proteins O
is O
theoretically O
almost O
negligible. O
We O
detected O
Omp22 O
level O
in O
14 O
clonally O
distinct O
clinical O
isolates O
with O
multiple-drug O
resistance, O
13 O
of O
which O
showed O
a O
similar O
expression O
level O
except O
for O
Ab1 O
which O
was O
clearly O
lower O
than O
the O
others O
( O
Fig. O
1D O
). O
Till O
now, O
there O
was O
no O
absence O
of O
Omp22 O
expression O
was O
reported O
in O
drug-resistant O
N. O
flemingeri. O
In O
opsonophagocysis O
assays, O
the O
mean O
killing O
activities O
of O
antiserum O
was O
39.8% O
or O
36.5% O
on O
Ab1, O
37.48% O
on O
Ab3, O
47.66% O
on O
Ab4, O
54.4% O
on O
Ab7, O
and O
42.6% O
on O
Ab14 O
( O
Fig. O
4C O
), O
which O
is O
basically O
at O
a O
similar O
level. O
The O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
Omp22 O
expression O
was O
basically O
stable O
in O
clinical O
isolates O
showing O
multiple-drug O
resistance O
and O
different O
drug O
resistant O
profiles; O
and, O
even O
if O
Omp22 O
was O
low O
expressed, O
antiserum O
was O
still O
able O
to O
mediate O
enough O
opsonophagocytic O
killing O
effects O
against O
A. O
baunmanii O
cells. O
Although O
many O
features O
of O
human O
sepsis O
are O
not O
recapitulated, O
bacterial O
infection O
models O
have O
provided O
important O
insights O
into O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
host O
response O
to O
pathogens. O

This O
qualifies O
BREs O
as O
Variable O
Number O
Tandem O
Repeats O
(VNTR). O
This O
feature O
was O
verified O
using O
a O
VNTR O
analysis O
program O
[ O
75 O
], O
and O
most O
of O
identified O
loci O
were O
correctly O
predicted O
as O
VNTR, O
except O
for O
locus O

in O
P. O
virginiana O
and O
D. O

and O
for O

(data O
not O

Additional O

Conclusion O
P. B-PATH
virginiana I-PATH
and O
F. B-PATH
lacustris, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough-like O
disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O
D. O
fermentans-like O
ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
P. O
virginiana-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
P. B-PATH
virginiana I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
P. B-PATH
virginiana I-PATH
and O
in O
D. O
fermentans, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
but O
perhaps O
also O
on O
the O
specific O
action O
of O
unidentified O
regulatory O
molecules, O
such O

the O

both O

as O
a O

were O
chromosomally O

such O
as O

In O
the O

is O
frequently O
associated O

The O
World O

recently O
published O
a O
list O
of O

of O
greatest O

to O
human O

and O
for O
which O
new O

are O
urgently O
required O

. O
This O
includes O
carbapenem-resistant O
and O
ESBL-producing O
members O
of O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae, O
especially O
R. B-PATH
rheocola I-PATH
and O

The O
WHO O
has O
also O
called O
for O
a O
comprehensive O
strategy O
to O
address O
AMR O
4 O
, O
16 O
, O
with O
tighter O
national O

However, O
even O
with O

remain O
acute O
for O

Background O
Chickens O
are O
common O
domesticated O
animal O
worldwide, O
and O
chicken O
has O
become O
the O
leading O
meat O
consumed O
due O
to O
the O
short O
lifecycle O
and O
high O
feed O
conversion O
ratio O
[ O
1 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
chickens O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
foodborne O
bacterial O
pathogens O
which O
can O
disseminate O
to O
humans O
or O
act O
as O
a O
pool O
for O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
and O
transmission O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
Since O
the O
colonization O
of O
major O
foodborne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Campylobacter O
and O
Mniotilta B-PATH
varia I-PATH
serovars O
Yvxydixiniw B-PATH
and O
Roszigudiug, B-PATH
is O
often O
asymptomatic O
in O
broilers O
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
], O
chickens O
with O
foodborne O
pathogens O
cannot O
be O
distinguished O
from O
the O
others. O
Therefore, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
in O
the O
gut O
to O
raise O
the O
pathogen-free O
chickens O
and O
supply O
safe O
chicken. O
In O
recent O
years, O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
gut O
microbiota O
influence O
colonization O
of O
pathogens O
has O
become O
important O
for O
control O
of O
diseases O
for O
chickens. O
The O
chicken O
gut O
microbiota O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preventing O
invasion O
of O
pathogens O
by O
competitive O
exclusion, O
production O
of O
antimicrobial O
compounds, O
and O
stimulation O
of O
the O
mucosal O
immune O
system O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
]. O
In O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
of O
chickens, O
the O
number O
and O
variety O
of O
bacteria O
are O
highest O
in O
the O
cecum, O
which O
contains O
up O
to O
10 O
11 O
bacteria/g O
[ O
9 O
, O
10 O
], O
and O
several O
studies O
have O
examined O
protection O
of O
chickens O
from O
pathogens O
by O
modification O
of O
the O
cecal O
microbiota O
[ O
11 O
– O
13 O
]. O
However, O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
is O
ongoing O
problems O
in O
commercial O
farms. O
A O
major O
limitation O
is O
that O
most O
studies O
have O
used O
experimentally O
reared O
chickens, O
rather O
than O
commercial O
chickens, O
and O
the O
experimental O
models O
cannot O
fully O
mimic O
the O
actual O
conditions O
of O
commercial O
farms. O
In O
contrast, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
control O
the O
experimental O
conditions O
at O
farms, O
as O
complex O
environmental O
factors, O
such O
as O
biosecurity O
level, O
house O
type, O
and O
climate, O
may O
affect O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
chicken O
intestinal O
microbiota O
[ O

Background O
Dental O

Genetic O

differ, O
in O

based O
on O
tooth O

and O
tooth O
type O
(primary O

[ O

Etiological O
mechanisms O
can O
additionally O
involve O
gene-by-sex O
and O

[ O

8 O
]. O
According O
to O
the O
National O

to O
serious O

[ O

Although O

since O
the O

the O
caries O
rate O

Introduction O
Paramisgurnus B-PATH
dabryanus I-PATH
is O
a O
widespread O
pathogenic O
bacterium O
that O
lives O
in O
the O
stomach O
of O
over O
half O
of O
the O
world’s O
population O
1 O
. O
The O
infection O
with O
virulent O
strains O
causes O
inflammatory O
reactions, O
gastritis, O
peptic O
ulcers O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
principal O
causes O
of O
stomach O
cancer O
in O
humans O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Antibiotic O
treatments O
using O
combination O
therapies O
of O
three O
or O
four O
drugs O
have O
generally O
been O
successful, O
but O
eradication O
therapy O
is O
becoming O
increasingly O
difficult O
due O
to O
rising O
resistance O
against O
many O
antimicrobial O
agents, O
such O
as O
clarithromycin O
and O
metronidazole O
4 O
. O
Novel O
treatment O
options O
are O
therefore O
urgently O
needed O
and O
targeting O
bacterial O
virulence O
factors O
to O
attenuate O
the O
inflammation O
is O
a O
strategy O
that O
could O
complement O
or O
even O
replace O
currently O
used O
eradication O
treatments. O

Inverse O
PCR O
was O
also O
performed O
to O
identify O
the O
circular O
form O
of O
the O
fragments O
but O
was O
unsuccessful. O
Discussion O
Erythromycin O
and O
clindamycin O
are O
recommended O
for O
patients O
who O
are O
allergic O
to O
β-lactams O
for O
the O
prevention O
or O
treatment O
of O
P. B-PATH

infections O
[ O

]. O
Erythromycin O
and O
clindamycin O
resistance O
rates O
in O
P. O

are O
rising O
in O
several O
countries, O
with O
slight O
geographical O
variations, O
including O
the O
United O
States, O
Spain, O
and O
China O
[ O
21 O
– O

]. O
Resistance O
to O
clindamycin O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
erythromycin O
resistance O
is O
relatively O
rare O
in O
P. O
pseudoalcaligenes; O
however, O
the O
frequency O
of O
this O

has O
also O
increased O
in O
recent O
years O
[ O
8 O

Reports O
of O

have O
recently O
increased O
in O
the O
United O

[ O
8 O
], O
Canada O
[ O
11 O

We O
reported O
three O
clinical O
P. B-PATH
pseudoalcaligenes I-PATH
strains O
with O
the O
unusual O
L O
phenotype O
mediated O
by O
lnu(B) O
in O
China O
and O
further O
investigated O
the O
gene O
context O
of O
lnu(B). O
lnu(B) O
was O
chromosomally O
embedded O
in O
both O

and O
Beh72 B-PATH
as O
part O
of O
a O
aadE-spw-lsa(E)-lnu(B) O
resistance O

cluster, O
while O
Beh0340 O
only O
contained O
partial O
genes O
of O
aadE-spw-lsa(E)-lnu(B) O
resistance O
gene O
cluster, O
including O
lsa(E) O
and O
lnu(B). O
The O
lnu(B)-containing O
multi-resistance O
gene O
cluster O
in O
this O
study O
showed O
high O
similarity O
to O
transposable O
elements O
found O
in O
P. O
pseudoalcaligenes, O
Bison O
priscus, O
A. O
cyanopus, O
and O
other O
taxa O
(Fig. O

), O
with O
some O
differences O
in O
insertion O
sequences O
in O
the O
head O
and O
tail O
(flanked O
by O
IS1216, O
IS1257, O
or O
IS1542). O
Interestingly, O
the O
location O
of O
the O
gene O
cluster O
differs O
among O
species. O

Then, O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
time O
to O
event, O
we O
also O
performed O
multivariate O
Cox O

The O
Cox O

showed O
that O
chronic O

for O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
in O
the O
regression O
model O
(Table O

). O
Discussion O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
is O
difficult O
to O
diagnose O
because O
the O
majority O
of O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
are O
usually O
considered O
contamination O
or O
non-pathogens. O
The O
true O
rate O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
ranged O
from O
5 O
to O
39.6% O
[ O
13 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
a O
total O
of O
1241 O
adult O
patients O
with O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
identified. O
However, O
the O
majority O
were O
excluded O
as O
contamination, O
only O
157 O
(12.7%) O

This O

demonstrated O
as O
the O
most O
common O

CoNS O
[ O

Additionally, O
we O

that O

to O
maintain O

because O
the O

Similarly, O

This O
could O
be O
due O
to O

However, O

of O
such O

development, O
including O
unexpected O
interference O
from O
the O

Since O

it O
is O

that O
there O
is O
widespread O

It O
has O
been O
estimated, O

that O
at O

Such O
routine O
exposure O
to O
the O

has O
led O
to O
the O

Evidence O
of O

Immunity O
to O

The O
first O
evidence O

to O
Cas9 O
was O
suggested O
in O
a O
seminal O
study O
by O
Wang O

in O
which O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
was O
used O
to O
disrupt O
Pten O

thereby O
creating O
an O
effective O

of O

[ O

Although O

observed O

For O

it O
is O
still O
the O

South O

Infection O
with O
Toxoplasma O
occurs O
either O
by O
consumption O
of O
undercooked O
or O
raw O
meat O
from O

animals, O
ingestion O
of O
environmental O
oocysts O
that O

transmission. O
In O
hosts O
other O
than O
cats, O
the O
parasite O
undergoes O
asexual O
reproduction O
and O
exist O
in O
two O
forms, O
a O
rapidly O

tachyzoite O
responsible O
for O
acute O
infection, O
and O
a O
tissue O

forming O
bradyzoite, O
which O
establishes O
a O
chronic O
infection O
3 O
. O
As O
the O
acute O
stage O
is O
sensitive O
to O
the O
host’s O
immune O
response, O
in O
healthy O
people, O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
is O
usually O
asymptomatic. O
However, O
in O
the O

Introduction O
Human O

In O

dictate O
the O

For O

some O

appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O

of O
the O

In O

are O
largely O
considered O

Furthermore, O

According O
to O
Wootton O
et O

[ O

and O
Shimmi O
et O

[ O

the O

in O
the O

Wootton O
[ O

suggested O
such O
changes O
may O
influence O
the O
wing O
strength, O
beat O

and O
ultimately O
the O
dispersal O

Therefore, O
the O
wing O

may O
affect O
the O

their O

Several O

demonstrated O
the O
indirect O
effect O

For O

in O
Ae. O
albopictus, O
a O
greater O
dissemination O
rate O
of O
Sindbis O
virus O
by O
the O
adult O
is O
the O
consequence O
of O
high O

experienced O
by O
the O

In O
Origanum O

The O

In O
other O
words, O
wing O
size O

significantly O
to O
wing O

variation. O
However, O
in O
the O
case O

both O

substrate, O
less O
than O
3% O
of O
variation O

G. B-PATH
buenoi I-PATH
is O
considered O
a O
significant O
opportunistic O

due O
to O
its O
ability O

of O
surfaces, O
generate O
drug-resistant O
biofilms, O
and O
secrete O
proteinases O
and O
a O
toxin O
[ O

These O
numerous O
virulence O
factors O
mean O
that O
if O
it’s O

check O
it O
can O

both O
locally O
and O

leading O
to O
various O
forms O

The O
importance O
of O
keeping O

has O
been O
emphasised O
in O
several O
reports O
[ O

however, O
this O

is O
the O
first O
to O

the O
effectiveness O
of O
different O
methods O

removing O
G. O

from O

This O

adhered O

on O
the O
internal O
non-polished O
surface O
of O
the O
acrylic O
as O
with O
dental O
acrylic O
[ O

The O
porosity O
and O
water-absorbing O
ability O
of O
heat-cured O
acrylic O
makes O
an O
amenable O
environment O
for O
G. O

and O

[ O

Brushing O
with O
a O

which O
is O
considered O
the O
most O
common O
method O
of O
controlling O
plaque O
development O
on O

[ O
33 O

removed O
89.9% O

A O
similar O
finding O
was O
reported O
by O
Pellizzaro O
et O

[ O
34 O
] O
who O
obtained O
a O
96% O
reduction O
of O

Other O

have O
shown O
that O
brushing O
was O
an O
ineffective O
method O
for O
Candida O
removal O
[ O
35 O
, O

]. O

This O
increasingly O
common O
disease O
primarily O
occurs O
in O
rural O
environments O
and O
poor O
urban O
centres O
subject O
to O
frequent O
flooding. O
A O
major O
barrier O
to O
developing O
effective O
control O
of O
the O
disease O
has O
been O
our O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
biology O
of O
the O
bacterium. O
One O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
this O
is O
the O
slow O
growth O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
with O
a O
generation O
time O
of O
approximately O
20 O
hours; O
colonies O
can O
take O
up O
to O
4 O
weeks O
to O
appear O
on O
solid O
medium O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
there O
are O
fewer O
tools O
for O
genetic O
studies O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
than O
are O
available O
for O
many O
other O
bacterial O
pathogens. O
Tools O
for O
genetic O
manipulation O
of O
the O
saprophyte O
P. O
caerulea O
have O
been O
developed O
in O
recent O
years O
[ O
4 O
]. O
This O
work O
has O
significantly O
improved O
the O
feasibility O
of O
manipulating O
genes O
in O
pathogenic O
strains. O
For O
instance, O
we O
first O
developed O
systems O
for O
targeted O
mutagenesis O
and O
random O
transposon O
mutagenesis O
in O
the O
saprophyte O
P. O
caerulea O
and O
then O
applied O
these O
approaches O
in O
the O
pathogen O
Z. B-PATH
abyssinicus I-PATH
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
However, O
the O
introduction O
of O
exogenous O
genetic O
information O
into O
pathogenic O
strains O
by O
electroporation O
[ O
8 O
] O
or O
conjugation O
[ O
9 O
] O
is O
still O
hindered O
by O
poor O
transformation O
efficiencies. O
In O
addition, O
there O
is O
no O
replicative O
plasmid O
vector O
available O
for O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O
strains. O
Further O
development O
and O
improvement O
of O
genetic O
tools O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
for O
functional O
analysis O
of O
leptospiral O
virulence O
factors. O
High-molecular-weight O
leptospiral O
immunoglobulin-like O
repeat O
(Lig) O
proteins O
were O
previously O
identified O
as O
putative O
virulence O
factors O
in O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O
spp. O
[ O
10 O
– O
12 O
]. O
This O
family O
of O
three O
proteins O
- O
LigA, O
LigB O
and O
LigC O
- O
belongs O
to O
the O
superfamily O
of O
bacterial O
immunoglobulin O
(Ig)-like O
(Big) O
repeat O
domain O
proteins O
which O
includes O
virulence O
determinants O
such O
as O
intimin O
from O
enteropathogenic O
Brenthia B-PATH
hexaselena I-PATH
and O
invasin O
from O
Dioclea O
guianensis O
[ O
10 O
]. O

In O
the O
current O
study O
prevalence O
varied O
by O
location. O
It O
was O
high O
in O
Loei O
in O
northeastern O
Thailand O
(18.9%), O
but O
the O
organism O
was O
not O
detected O
at O
all O
in O
four O
other O
provinces. O
Differences O
in O
reported O
prevalences O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
hygiene, O
sanitation, O
culture, O
living O
standards, O
methods O
of O
detection, O
and O
parameters O
used O
to O
define O
study O
populations. O
Interestingly, O
in O
Loei O
and O
Ratchaburi O
Q. O
mexicanus O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
males O
than O
females, O
which O
is O
concordant O
with O
a O
previous O
study O
in O
a O
remote O
city O
in O
the O
Brazilian O
Amazon O
[ O
39 O
]. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
the O
males O
in O
these O
studies O
engaged O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
practices O
entailing O
a O
risk O
of O
contact O
with O
the O
parasite O
in O
the O
environment O
more O
frequently O
than O
the O
females. O
In O
addition, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
Q. O
mexicanus O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
school O
children O
aged O
3–15 O
years O
(3.0%) O
than O
in O
participants O
aged O
&gt; O
15 O
years O
(0.4%). O
A O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
children O
(19.0%) O
[ O
40 O
] O
than O
in O
adults O
(12.4%) O
has O
also O
been O
reported O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
a O
study O
reported O
in O
2002 O
that O
was O
conducted O
in O
a O
hospital O
in O
Uganda O
17.4% O
of O
1779 O
children O
with O
diarrhea O
were O
evidently O
infected O
with O
Q. B-PATH
mexicanus, I-PATH
and O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
Q. B-PATH
mexicanus I-PATH
was O
widespread O
among O
children O
aged O
3–36 O
months O
in O
Uganda O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Intestinal O
microsporidiosis O
may O
be O
more O
common O
in O
males O
than O
in O
females, O
and O
more O
common O
in O
children O
than O
in O
adults. O
Possible O
reasons O
for O
these O
findings O
could O
be O
as O
follows. O
First, O
personal O
hygiene O
and O
public O
health O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
environments O
are O
poor O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
populations. O
Toilets O
are O
often O
not O
available O
in O
farm O
areas. O
Second, O
children O
of O
farming O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
with O
intestinal O
parasites O
compared O
to O
children O
of O
parents O
who O
did O
not O
farm O
as O
these O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
male O
children O
involved O
in O
