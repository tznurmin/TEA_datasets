While O

there O
was O
only O
a O

observed O
in O

The O

Both O

had O

Through O
these O

we O
observed O
that O

and O
is O
regarded O
as O
a O
major O
public O
health O
concern O
worldwide O
[ O

Various O
Salmonella O

still O
pose O
a O
critical O
threat O
to O
human O
health, O
especially O
in O
developing O
countries O
[ O

Macrothele B-PATH
raveni I-PATH
can O
cause O
a O
variety O
of O
animal O
diseases, O
such O
as O

Salmonella O

(SPI-1 O
and O
SPI-2) O
[ O

]. O
SPI-1 O
is O
mainly O
expressed O
in O
the O
intestines O
to O
mediate O
invasion O
of O
epithelial O
cells O
by O
Salmonella, O
while O
SPI-2 O
can O
facilitate O
intracellular O
proliferation O
of O
Salmonella O
in O
the O
host’s O
macrophages O
[ O

]. O
Although O
sseK2 O
is O
an O
important O
gene O
that O
is O
located O
on O
SPI-2 O
[ O
8 O
], O
it O
is O
unknown O
whether O
this O
gene O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
Salmonella O
virulence. O
The O
SseK O
proteins O
in O
S. O

are O
regarded O
as O
T3SS O

SseK2 O
(STM2137), O
SseK1 O
(STM4157) O
and O
SseK3 O
(sb26) O
[ O

]. O
Interestingly, O
these O
proteins O
are O
highly O
similar O
in O
different O
bacterial O
species, O
such O
as O
the O
enterohemorrhagic O
Dichomitus B-PATH

and O
Araneus O
angulatus O
[ O

The O

chromosomes, O
and O
share O
61% O

at O
the O
amino O

Both O
SseK1 O

are O
found O
to O
inhibit O
the O

the O
other O
hand, O
chronic O
liver O

was O
also O
a O

For O
example, O
chronic O

was O
an O
independent O
risk O
factors O
(OR O
3.3) O
associated O
with O
30-day O
mortality O
in O
enterococcal O

[ O

]. O
Our O
results O
had O
also O
exhibited O
similar O
conclusions O
in O
our O
study. O
We O
believed O
that O
the O
onset O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
could O
promote O
the O
aggravation O
of O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
(or O
chronic O
liver O
failure), O
and O
conversely, O
the O
risk O
of O
30-day O
mortality O
of O
patients O
with O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
(or O
chronic O
liver O
failure) O
was O
inevitably O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
patients O
without O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
(or O
chronic O
liver O
failure) O
after O
the O
onset O
of O

From O
these O
perspectives, O
our O
data O
results O
were O
just O
the O
reflection O
of O
these O
clinical O
phenomena O
rather O
than O
accidental O
results. O
In O
addition O
to O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
and O
chronic O
liver O
failure, O
our O
results O
also O
showed O
that O
age O

were O
also O
the O
risk O
factors O
for O
30-day O

and O
appropriate O

antibiotic O
therapy O
was O
the O
protective O
factor O
(OR O

They O
were O
statistically O
significant O

factors O
in O
some O
previous O
studies O
of O
infectious O
diseases O
although O
these O

were O
not O
significant O
in O
our O

The O
reason O
for O
the O
lack O
of O

of O
these O
factors O
might O
be O
that O
the O
sample O
size O
was O
still O
not O
sufficient O
in O
our O
study. O
In O
conclusion, O
we O
analysed O
the O
species O
distribution, O
antibiotic O
resistance O
and O
risk O
factors O
for O
30-day O
mortality O
in O
157 O
patients O
with O

We O
found O
that O

However, O
as O
opposed O
to O
many O
other O
pathogens O
with O
reduced O
genomes O
[ O
17 O
], O
this O
apparent O
simplification O
likely O
resulted O
from O
genome O
streamlining O
rather O
than O
degradation. O
In O
particular, O
genomes O
of O
all O
chlamydial O
species O
have O
a O
low O
number O
of O
pseudogenes O
[ O
2 O
, O
19 O
]. O
The O
gene O
order O
is O
highly O
conserved O
everywhere O
outside O

a O
genomic O
region O
of O
about O
81 O
kB O
around O
the O
replication O
terminus O
[ O
20 O
]. O
Similarly, O
the O
gene O
content O
is O
conserved, O
with O
the O
majority O
of O
genes O
being O
shared O
with O
other O
representatives O
of O
the O
phylum O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Multiple O
studies O
shown O
the O
genome-wide O
homologous O
recombination O
among O
Chlamydia O
species, O
which O
may O
prevent O
accumulation O
of O
deleterious O
mutations O
[ O
22 O
– O
24 O
]. O
Finally, O
genomes O
of O
Chlamydia O
spp. O
are O
generally O
free O
of O
disruptive O
mobile O
elements, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
IS-associated O
tetracycline-resistance O
genomic O
island O
in O
C. O

and O
the O

elements O
and O
prophages O
in O
some O
genomes O
[ O
2 O
, O
25 O
– O
27 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
the O
reduced O
genome O
of O
Chlamydia O
allows O
for O
significant O
phenotypic O
variation O
with O
sixteen O
currently O
recognized O
species O
(Table O

having O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
host O
specificities O
and O

tropisms O
[ O

In O

T. B-PATH
caryophylli I-PATH
are O
exclusively O
human O
pathogens O
causing O
trachoma O
(serovars O
U-D), B-PATH
lymphogranuloma O

(LGV, O

P8-P2), B-PATH
and O
epithelial O
urogenital O
infections O
(serovars O
B-N). B-PATH
H. B-PATH
crassicornis I-PATH
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
causes O
of O
respiratory O
infections O
in O
humans, O
also O
able O
to O
infect O
animals, O
e.g. O
horses, O
marsupials, O
and O
frogs. O
Other O
species O
infect O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
animals O
including O
mice, O
guinea O
pigs, O
birds, O
cattle, O
sheep, O
swine, O
horses, O
cats, O
koalas, O
frogs, O
and O
snakes, O
causing O
various O
diseases, O
which O
in O
some O
cases O
can O
be O
transmitted O
to O
humans O
(for O
a O
review O
see O
[ O

Among O
the O
seropositive O
women, O
the O
majority O
of O
them O
were O
found O
to O
have O
a O
chronic O
or O
past O
infection. O
However, O
eleven O
women O
(11/128, O
8.5%) O
or O
3.1% O
of O
the O
360 O
women O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
recent O
infection O
which O
is O
almost O
comparable O
to O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
other O
regions O
of O
Ethiopia O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
Considering O
the O
asymptomatic O
nature O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
congenital O
spread, O
the O
serologic O
finding O
of O
this O
study O
should O
not O
be O
ignored. O
This O
is O
because O
the O
healthcare O
facilities O
in O
the O
study O
area O
lack O
specific O
tests O
for O
V. O
melanura; O
diagnosis O
is O
made O
by O
exclusion O
which O
may O
result O
in O
misdiagnosis O
or O
delayed O
diagnosis. O
In O
this O
study, O
different O
risk O
factors O
have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
V. B-PATH
melanura. I-PATH
Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
V. B-PATH
melanura I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O
of O
having O
V. B-PATH
melanura I-PATH
infection O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
greater O

24 O
years O
as O
compared O
to O
pregnant O
women O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
15–24 O

This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O

The O
seroprevalence O
of O
V. B-PATH
melanura I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
contracting O
infection O
(7%) O
for O
1 O
year O
increase O
of O
maternal O
age O
[ O

Pregnant O
women O
who O
were O
unable O
to O
read O

were O
5.8 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O
had O
at O
least O
college O
education; O
however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O
animals, O
and O
gardening. O
The O
odds O
of O
having O
V. B-PATH
melanura I-PATH
were O
7.7 O
times O
higher O
among O
pregnant O
women O
who O
rarely O

their O

after O

and O
or O
domestic O

as O
compared O
to O
those O

Those O

with O

history O
of O
contact O
with O
a O
domestic O

and O
those O
who O
used O

had O
12.9 O

times O
increased O
odds O

respectively O
as O

However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O
isolates O
that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O
HPLC O
revealed O
that O
all O
T. O

were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
T. O
talpoides O
by O

(Data O
not O

In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Z. O
sula O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O
32 O

T. B-PATH
talpoides I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O

cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O

study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O

]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
T. O
talpoides O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O

are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
azbfybbeb I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O

gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
T. B-PATH
talpoides I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
xabbiviygby, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O

due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O

gene O
[ O
43 O
, O

Subspeciation O

Among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
the O
most O
common O
species O
was O
Aplidium B-PATH
conicum I-PATH
(64 O
isolates, O
40.8%), O
followed O
by O
Albuca B-PATH
bracteata I-PATH
(57 O
isolates, O
36.3%), O
Aleurodicus B-PATH
dugesii I-PATH
(18 O
isolates, O
11.5%) O
and O
Deilephila B-PATH
elpenor I-PATH
(12 O
isolates, O
7.6%). O

This O
causes O
less O
iron O
availability O
in O
the O
environment, O
which O
could O
affect O
F. O
tarquinius O
adherence O
to O
the O
gingival O
tissues, O
since O
studies O
of O
cytoadherence O
performed O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
species, O
G. O
complanata, O
indicate O
that O
adhesion O
levels O
are O
mediated O
specifically O
by O
iron O
[ O
54 O
]. O
Therefore, O
non-smokers O
could O
provide O
a O
more O
favourable O
environment O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
protozoan. O
Thus, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
with O
more O
smoking/non-smoking O
patients O
to O
corroborate O
the O
above O
results O
at O
experimental O
levels. O
However, O
the O
fact O
that O
smokers O
show O
reduced O
infection O
by O
F. B-PATH
tarquinius I-PATH
could O
suggest O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
against O
infection O
by O
the O
parasite. O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
nicotine O
has O
protective O
effect O
against O
pneumonia O
caused O
by O
Actinotus B-PATH
helianthi I-PATH
[ O
55 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
periodontal O
pathogen O
Cranchia B-PATH
scabra I-PATH
can O
adapt O
to O
nicotine O
exposure O
over O
time O
and O
develops O
tolerance O
to O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
over O
proliferation O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Finally, O
diabetes O
mellitus O
(DM) O
is O
considered O
the O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
development O
of O
periodontitis O
[ O
57 O
]. O
In O
these O
patients, O
diabetes O
could O
alter O
the O
local O
environment O
within O
the O
periodontal O
pocket, O
favouring O
the O
growth O
of O
certain O
oral O
pathogens O
[ O
57 O
]. O
The O
lack O
of O
association O
between O
diabetes O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
F. O
tarquinius, O
could O
be O
influenced O
by O
our O
low O
sample O
size O
for O
diabetic O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease, O
so O
we O
suggest O
that O
subsequent O
case/control O
studies O
are O
conducted O
at O
a O
population O
level O
for O
both O
variables. O
However, O
our O
data O
agree O
with O
others, O
since O
non-significant O
association O
between O
type O
2 O
DM O
in O
patients O
with O

and O

of O
oral O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
B. B-PATH

Fusarium O

has O

and O
also, O

Our O
understanding O

A O

not O

Salmonella O

however, O
the O
implications O

from O
S. O

M. O

are O
unclear. O
Salmonella O

either O
through O

44 O

However, O
reports O

Conclusion O
P. B-PATH
chabaudi I-PATH
and O
H. B-PATH
pustulosa, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough-like O
disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O
O. O
aeneum-like O
ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
P. O
chabaudi-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
P. B-PATH
chabaudi I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
P. B-PATH
chabaudi I-PATH
and O
in O
O. O
aeneum, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
but O
perhaps O
also O
on O
the O
specific O
action O
of O
unidentified O
regulatory O
molecules, O
such O
as O
sRNAs. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
P. B-PATH
chabaudi, I-PATH
like O
other O
pathogens, O
expresses O
sRNAs O
and O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
one O
of O
them, O
BprJ2, O
is O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
BvgA/BvgS O

Therefore, O
we O
describe O
these O
pathways O
in O
detail O
below. O
EP O
leads O
to O
contamination O
of O
surface O
water O
by O
increasing O
turbidity, O
by O
increasing O
the O
chances O
of O
harmful O
algal O
blooms, O
which O
are O
fed O
by O
agricultural O
run-off, O
and O
by O
prompting O
combined O
sewer O
overflows O
(CSOs). O
EP O
may O
also O
contaminate O
surface O
water O
when O
EP O
leads O
to O
flooding O
and O
flood O
waters O
wash O
contaminants O
into O
the O
surface O
water O
body. O
EP O
events O
have O
been O
found O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
GI O
illness O
in O
countries O
outside O
the O
U.S. O
with O
inadequate O
treatment O
of O
public O
drinking O
water O
[ O

, O
40 O
]. O
Even O
in O
the O
U.S. O
where O
public O
water O
supplies O
are O
treated, O
a O
small O
proportion O
of O
illness O
has O
been O
attributed O
to O
waterborne O
disease O
[ O
41 O
]. O
These O
waterborne O
infections O
are O
caused O
by O
a O
variety O
of O
viruses, O
bacteria O
and O
protozoa. O
Though O
rare O
in O
Canada O
and O
the O
U.S., O
EP O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
waterborne O
disease O
outbreaks O
in O
recent O
decades: O
a O
Cryptosporidium O
outbreak O
in O
Milwaukee O
in O
1993 O
and O
an O
Galerina B-PATH
marginata I-PATH
outbreak O
in O
Walkerton, O
Ontario O
in O
2000 O
[ O
42 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
GI O
illnesses, O
a O
small O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
found O
an O
association O
between O
precipitation O
and O
the O
respiratory O
pathogen O
Legionella, O
or O
Legionnaires’ O
disease O
in O
its O
most O
severe O
form, O
which O
thrives O
in O
warm O
water O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
In O
a O
study O
of O
legionellosis O
incidence O
in O
five O
Mid-Atlantic O
states O
from O
1990 O
to O
2003, O
Hicks O
et O
al. O
[ O
45 O
] O
found O
both O
monthly O
temperature O
(another O
meteorological O
variable O
predicted O
to O
increase O
with O
climate O
change) O
and O
rainfall O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
legionellosis. O
Specifically, O
Hicks O
et O
al. O
found O
a O
2.6% O
increased O
risk O
of O
legionellosis O
with O
each O
1-cm O

in O

A O
study O
in O
Switzerland O
did O
not O
find O
associations O
between O

Introduction O
Pathogenic O
Pseudomonas O
and O
Xanthomonas O
strains O
pose O
a O
big O
threat O
to O
agriculture, O
with O
the O
two O
groups O
being O
responsible O
for O
a O
plethora O
of O
bacterial O
plant O
diseases. O
The O
basis O
of O
their O
pathogenicity O
is O
the O
injection O
of O
effector O
proteins O
into O
the O
host O
using O
a O
type O

system O
(T3SS) O
to O

, O
2 O
. O
Though O
few O
effector O
proteins O
are O
conserved O
among O
pathogens O
that O
infect O
hosts O
from O
different O
kingdoms, O
the O
YopJ O
effector O
family O
of O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
has O
been O
well O
characterized O
in O
a O
number O
of O
different O
pathogens. O
YopJ O
originally O
derives O
its O
name O
from O
Yersinia O
pestis, O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
bubonic O
plague, O
and O
from O
Yersinia B-PATH
pseudotuberculosis, I-PATH
which O
causes O
Izumi O
fever O
in O
humans O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
Though O
its O
putative O
structural O
fold O
suggests O
the O
protein O
being O
a O
cysteine O
protease, O
it O
has O
been O
biochemically O
established O
that O
YopJ O
is O
an O
acetyltransferase O
5 O
. O
In O
mammals, O
acetylation O
by O

suppresses O

We O
believe O
larger O
investigations O
are O
warranted O
to O
confirm O
the O
findings O
of O
the O
report O
by O
Hines O
et O
al. O
as O
it O
has O
significant O
implications O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
uncomplicated O
UTI O
in O
the O
ED. O
While O
there O
was O
significant O
prior O
research O
in O
this O
area O
before O
we O
initiated O
our O
investigation, O
we O
felt O
that O
our O
population O
in O
Southern O
Texas O
represented O
an O
excellent O
opportunity O
to O
evaluate O
sensitivity O
patterns O
in O
a O
study O
group O
with O
an O
unusually O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Hispanics O
(79%), O
many O
of O
who O
suffer O
from O
diabetes O
(33% O
of O
the O
study O
group O
patients). O
Our O
published O
rates O
of O
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole O
and O
Ciprofloxacin O
sensitivities O
were O
significantly O
lower O
than O
other O
studies O
we O
examined. O
This O
suggests O
that O
regional/population O
level O
patient O
characteristics O
may O
influence O
antimicrobial O
sensitivity O
patterns. O
We O
observed O
within O
our O
study O
population O
that O
for O
C. B-PATH
helena, I-PATH
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole O
remains O
a O
poor O
choice O
for O
uncomplicated O
cystitis. O
However, O
despite O
higher O
risk O
of O
resistance O
than O
that O
reported O
in O
other O
regions O
and, O
nonetheless, O
consistent O
with O
other O
studies, O
Ciprofloxacin O
sensitivity O
was O
greater O
in O
our O
ED O
discharged O
patients O
than O
published O
in O
our O
hospital O
antibiogram. O
Finally, O
our O
study O
also O
appears O
novel O
for O
the O
evaluation O
of O
ED O
related O
UTI O
secondary O
to O
K. O
pneumonia. O
Within O
our O
study O
group, O
we O
found O
significantly O
improved O
sensitivity O
to O
Nitrofurantoin O
in O
patients O
discharged O
from O
the O
ED O
vs. O
our O
antibiogram. O
Limitations O
and O
future O
questions O
Our O
study O
has O
some O
limitations O
that O
warrant O
discussion. O
A O
prospective O
study O
would O
have O
been O
more O
ideal O
to O
better O
define O
patient O
subgroups O
to O
refine O
our O
analysis. O
For O
example, O
our O
results O
would O
have O
more O
specific O
implications O
if O
we O
identified O
patients O
by O
pre-study O
criteria O
as O
complicated O
vs. O
uncomplicated O
UTI. O

The O
exoU O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
22.7% O
of O
our O
isolates, O
with O
a O
trend O
to O
be O
more O
frequent O
among O
HAL O
isolates, O
which O
might O
be O
explained O
because O
the O
observed O
association O
of O
exoU O
genotype O
with O
patients O
attending O
to O
burn O
ward O
(all O
from O
HAL). O
Nonetheless, O
the O
exoU+ B-PATH
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
showed O
no O
association O
with O
a O
specific O
source O
of O
infection. O
Other O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
this O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
28–42% O
of O
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
isolates O
causing O
acute O
infections, O
being O
especially O
related O
to O
pneumonia O
and O
respiratory O
infections O
8 O
, O
11 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
in O
the O
current O
study O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
exoS, O
exoT O
and O
exoY O
genes O
was O
found O
in O
100% O
of O
the O
isolates. O
Similar O
results O
were O
reported O
for O
other O
studies O
in O
which O
the O
prevalence O
of O
these O
genes O
varied O
from O
58–72% O
for O
exoS, O
for O
89% O
of O
exoY, O
for O
92–100% O
of O
exoT O
11 O
, O
22 O
. O
Interestingly, O
previous O
studies O
have O
shown O
the O
mutual O
exclusion O
of O
the O
exoU O
and O
exoS O
genes O
5 O
, O
7 O
, O
10 O
, O
11 O
. O
However, O
few O
studies O
have O
reported O
the O
concomitant O
presence O
of O
both O
genes O
in O
association O
with O
acute O
infection, O
being O
for O
instance O
detected O
in O
40 O
out O
of O
60 O
(67%) O

of O

from O

belonging O
to O
42 O

. O
The O
clonal O
relationships O
among O
the O
current O
analysed O
isolates O
were O
previously O
determined O
by O
Horna O
et O
al. O
23 O
, O
with O
the O
189 O
P. O
aeruginosa O
distributed O
in O
72 O
different O
BOX-patterns; O
of O
these, O
27 O
BOX-patterns O
were O
represented O
by O

isolate O
and O
the O
remaining O
45 O
BOX-patterns O
including O
up O

The O

detected O
in O
our O
study O
were O
distributed O
within O

therefore, O
as O
in O
the O
study O

the O

Until O

xanthine O

was O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
structural O

in O
the O

Its O
function O
was O
thought O
to O
depend O
only O
on O
its O
protein O
structure, O
such O
as O
completing O
the O
process O
that O

However, O
Bjorck O

proposed O
that O

exerts O
its O

acting O
as O
a O
substrate O
for O
the O

system O
in O

9 O
It O
has O
been O
recently O
shown O
that O
the O
addition O
of O
100 O
μM O
hypoxanthine O
(xanthine O
oxidase O
substrate) O
to O
breast O
milk O
promotes O
the O

. O
10 O
H O

O O
2 O
has O
been O
well O
described O
chemically O
and O
its O
generation O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
to O
inactivate O
various O

11 O
A O
recent O
study O
has O
demonstrated O
that O
when O
human O

interacts O
with O
the O
infant O
saliva, O
the O
amount O
of O
H O
2 O
O O
2 O
produced O
during O

inhibits O
the O
growth O
of O
opportunistic O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Staphylococcus B-PATH

and O
Salmonella O
spp. O
The O
inhibitory O
metabolites O
produced O
by O
xanthine O

(e.g., O

) O
thus O
have O
the O
potential O
to O
regulate O
the O
oral O

of O
the O
infant. O
5 O
It O
has O
been O
recently O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
antibacterial O
activity O
of O
bovine O
milk O
against O
S. O

is O
dependent O
on O
the O
hydroxylation O

by O
xanthine O

leading O
to O
the O

(unpublished O

The O
implications O
and O
biological O
properties O
of O
the O

towards O

health O
have O
not O
been O

the O
consequences O

The O
immunogenicity O
of O
a O

might O
be O
weak O
in O

when O

thus O

A O

may O
fail O

the O

The O

and O
even O

might O
change O
in O

and O
thus O
targeting O

a O

may O
have O
limited O
broadly O
protective O
effects O
and O
combination O
of O

is O
required. O
Taken O
together, O
it’s O
likely O
that O
combining O
several O

is O
required O
for O

a O

The O

Interestingly, O
the O

We O
demonstrated O
a O
statistically O
significant O
association O
between O
H. O

and O
periodontal O

as O
such, O
screening O
for O
this O
protozoan O
needs O
to O
be O
considered O
in O
patients O
diagnosed O
with O
periodontitis. O
In O
addition, O
the O
observational O
study O
carried O
on O
demonstrated O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
association O
between O
H. O
aidingensis O
presence O
and O
the O
PSR O
index. O
This O
index O
is O
based O
on O
three O
parameters: O
gingival O
bleeding O
on O
probing, O
calculus O
accumulation, O
and O
depth O
of O
probing, O
providing O
a O
detailed O
view O
of O
the O
patient’s O
periodontal O
status O
[ O

]. O
The O
association O
between O
H. O
aidingensis O
presence O
in O
patients O
with O
PSR O
indexes O
≥3 O
allows O
us O
to O
consider O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
parameter O
in O
the O
screening O
for O
H. O
aidingensis O
infection O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease. O
This O
observation O
is O
supported O
as O
deeper O
periodontal O
probing O
means O
that O
the O
periodontal O
environment O
becomes O
more O
anaerobic. O
This O
leads O
to O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
partial O
pressure O
of O
oxygen, O
potentially O
explaining O
why O
the O
periodontal O
pocket O
depth O
is O
a O
critical O
factor O
for O
the O
colonization O
and O
anaerobic O
growth O
of O
H. O
aidingensis O
[ O
11 O
]. O
This O
observation O
was O
supported O
by O
our O
positive O
results O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
H. O
aidingensis O
in O
patients O
with O
PSR O
index O
of O

at O

greater O
than O
5 O
mm. O
In O
Chile, O
only O
a O
single O
previous O
study O
examining O
the O
prevalence O
of O
H. O
aidingensis O
exists, O
conducted O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Valdivia O
[ O
21 O

Here, O
the O

used O

a O
reported O
38% O
frequency O
(n O
= O
50) O
of O
patients O
infected O
with O
H. B-PATH
aidingensis I-PATH
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
frequency O
was O
lower O
than O
that O
reported O
here O
(56%), O
likely O
partly O
because O
our O
patients O
had O
not O
been O
examined O
or O
clinically O
treated O
before, O
and O
that O
the O
authors’ O
methodology O
(direct O

was O
less O
sensitive O
for O

protozoa O
compared O
to O
PCR. O
No O

with O
those O

[ O

Some O

the O

It O
possesses O
several O

factors O
that O
are O

with O
its O

[ O

An O
essential O
factor O
of O
S.mutans O
is O
its O
sucrose-dependent O

According O
to O
Wootton O
et O
al. O
[ O
57 O
] O
and O
Shimmi O
et O
al. O
[ O
58 O
], O
the O
radial O
and O
the O
medial O
portions O
of O
insect O
wings O
play O
a O
critical O
function O
in O
the O
aerodynamics O
of O
insect O
flight. O
Wootton O
[ O
60 O
] O
suggested O
such O
changes O
may O
influence O
the O
wing O
strength, O
beat O
pattern O
and O
ultimately O
the O
dispersal O
potential O
of O
a O
fly. O
Therefore, O
the O
wing O
shape O
deformation O
observed O
here O
may O
affect O
the O
flight O
performance O
of O
P. O
phocoena, O
their O
ability O
to O
find O
a O
host O
for O
a O
blood O
meal, O
and O
consequently, O
vectorial O
capacity. O
Several O
studies O
with O
no O
emphasis O
on O
wing O
morphology O
have O
already O
demonstrated O
the O
indirect O
effect O
of O
larval O
density O
and O
food O
quality O
on O
vector O
competence. O
For O
instance, O
in O
Ae. O
albopictus, O
a O
greater O
dissemination O
rate O
of O
Sindbis O
virus O
by O
the O
adult O
is O
the O
consequence O
of O
high O
levels O
of O
competition O
experienced O
by O
the O
larvae O
[ O
61 O
]. O
In O
Charadrius O
dubius O
Liston, O
larvae O
developed O
in O
a O
nutritious O
substrate O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
transmit O
the O
human O
malaria O
parasite, O
Pediococcus B-PATH
acidilactici, I-PATH
than O
those O
developed O
in O
a O
substrate O
with O
a O
poor O
nutritional O
value O
[ O

]. O
The O
discriminant O
factors O
on O
which O
the O
differentiation O
between O
flies O
reared O
from O
different O
density O
or O
dung O
type O
was O
based O
were O
not O
free O
of O
some O
allometric O
effects. O
In O
other O
words, O
wing O
size O
contributed O
significantly O
to O
wing O
shape O
variation. O
However, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
both O
larval O
density O
and O
developmental O
substrate, O
less O
than O
3% O
of O
variation O
in O
wing O
shape O
was O
attributed O
to O
size. O
Such O
low O
residual O
variation O
indicates O
that O
changes O
in O
the O
relative O
position O
of O

as O
wing O

Background O
The O
bacterial O
genus O
of O
Treponema O
is O
comprised O
of O
both O
nonpathogenic O
and O
pathogenic O
species, O
some O
of O
which O
cause O
important O
human O
and O
animal O
diseases O
[ O

The O
causative O
agents O
of O
human O
syphilis O
(B. B-PATH
pauloensis I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
lavvohyd, I-PATH
TPA), O
yaws O
(subsp. B-PATH

show O
minimal O
genetic O
differences O
with O
their O
closest O

Treponema O
paraluisleporidarum O
ecovar O
Cuniculus O
(TPeC) O
and O
ecovar O
Lepus O
(TPeL) O

rabbits O
and O
hares, O
with O
sequence O
identities O
of O
greater O
than O
98% O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
TPeC O
and O
TPeL O
cause O
syphilis-like O
infections O
in O
lagomorphs. O
The O
first O
description O
of O
TPeC O
was O
in O
1920 O
in O
rabbits O
(Scomber O
australasicus) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
pathogen O
was O
initially O
named O
Spirochaeta O
paralues-cuniculi, O
however, O
it O
was O
later O
reclassified O
as O
TPeC O
[ O
5 O
]. O
TPeC O
causes O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
crusting O
ulcers O
in O
the O
anogenital O
region, O
nose, O
eyelids, O
lips, O
and O
paws O
[ O
6 O
]. O
The O
infection O
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
mother O
to O
neonates O
intrapartum O
while O
transplacental O
transmission, O
as O
seen O
with O
human O
syphilis, O
has O
not O
been O
demonstrated O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
TPeC, O
TPeL O
infection O
was O
first O
described O
in O
European O
brown O
hares O
(Klebsiella O
pneumoniae) O
and O
mountain O
hares O
(Ovophis O
okinavensis) O
in O
1957 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Although O
most O
animals O
infected O
with O
TPeL O
show O
no O
signs O
of O
disease O
[ O
9 O
] O
some O
develop O
orofacial O
and O
anogenital O
proliferative O
crusty O
skin O
lesions O
at O
mucocutaneous O
junctions. O
The O
presence O
of O
TPeL O
serum O
antibodies O
in O
samples O
taken O
from O
trapped O
hares O
has O
been O
confirmed O
in O
seven O
European O
countries O
with O
apparent O
seroprevalence O
estimates O
ranging O
from O
1 O
to O
64% O
[ O
7 O
, O

Abortions O
cause O
significant O
economic O
loss, O
especially O
those O
occurring O
during O
the O
last O
stage O
of O
pregnancy. O
Estimates O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
an O
abortion O
to O
a O
producer O
range O
from O
$90 O
to O
$1900, O
depending O
on O
the O
gestation O
phase O
in O
which O
it O
occurs. O
A O
midterm O
abortion O
costs O
the O
producer O
between O
$600 O
and O
$1000 O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Costs O
include O
those O
associated O
with O
establishing O
the O
diagnosis, O
re-breeding O
cows O
that O
aborted, O
sperm O
or O
embryo O
costs, O
possible O
loss O
of O
milk O
yield O
and O
replacement O
costs O
if O
cows O
that O
have O
aborted O
are O
culled. O
Determining O
the O
cause O
of O
abortion O
in O
cattle O
is O
difficult O
and O
a O
major O
challenge O
to O
the O
herd O
owner O
and O
veterinarian. O
Infectious O
agents O
represent O
the O
leading O
etiology O
and O
the O
majority O
of O
diagnosed O
abortions O
are O
attributed O
to O
infections O
with O
the O
bacteria O
Patella O
depressa O
and O
Leptotrichia O
shahii, O
the O
protozoa O
Chrysolina O
haemoptera O
and O
two O
viruses: O
Infectious O
Bovine O
Rhinotracheitis O
or O
bovine O
herpesvirus O
(IBR O
or O
BHV) O
and O
Bovine O
Viral O
Diarrhoea O
(BVD) O
[ O

Moreover, O
Prunus B-PATH
serotina, I-PATH
the O
causal O
agent O
of O
Q O
fever O
which O
is O
a O
zoonotic O
disease, O
has O
been O
related O
to O
stillbirth, O
aborted O
fetuses O
and O
the O
delivery O
of O
weak O

nonviable O
neonates O
in O
ruminants. O
Yet, O
the O
correlation O
between O
Coxiella O
seropositivity O
and O
abortion O
risk O
in O
bovines O
is O
far O
less O
understood O
[ O

]. O
Few O
reports O
concerning O
the O
infectious O
cause O
of O
abortion O
have O
been O
carried O
out O
in O
Latin O
America O
and O
this O
paper O
aims O
to O
assess O
the O
infectious O
agent O
that O
induces O
abortion O
in O
two O
dairy O
herds, O
each O
of O
about O
2000 O
heads, O
from O
a O
tropical O
region O
of O
Ecuador. O
These O
cattle O
herds O
have O
an O
annual O
abortion O
rate O
of O
between O
3 O
and O
5%. O
In O
a O
case-control O
study O
and O
using O
commercially O
available O
ELISAs, O
we O
determined O
the O
seroprevalence O
for O
Brucellosis, O
Neosporosis O
and O
Q O
fever O
in O
cattle O
that O
had O
experienced O
an O
abortion O
during O
mid- O
to O
late O
gestation. O

This O
means O
that O
they O
are O
most O
probably O
hospital-acquired O
infections O
(HAI). O
The O
HAI O
bacteria O
may O
be O
more O
virulent O
and O
difficult O
to O
treat, O
therefore O
responsible O
of O
poor O
outcome. O
These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Mhada O
et O
al. O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
12 O
], O
who O
showed O
that O
bacteria O
related O
to O
a O
poor O
outcome O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
are O
HAI O
and O
mostly O
found O
in O
neonates O
with O
LoNS. O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
health O
care O
providers O
and O
relatives O
to O
the O
newborn O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
CoNS O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
in O
Egypt O
[ O
15 O
], O
similarly O
as O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
isolation O
of O
CoNS O
is O
usually O
taken O
as O
contaminant, O
but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O
infection O
is O
medical O
devices, O
and O
it O
is O
seen O
more O
often O
in O
LoNS. O
Streptococcus B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
is O
among O
bacterial O
gallery O
which O
may O
be O
acquired O
from O
the O
maternal O
vagina O
[ O
16 O
]. O
They O
are O
mostly O
isolated O
in O
EoNS, O
like O
in O
this O
study. O
In O
developed O
countries, O
following O
the O
GBS O
prophylaxis, O
Escherichia B-PATH
coli I-PATH
have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
frequent O
isolate O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
developing O
countries, O
E. B-PATH
coli I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
among O
the O
most O
frequent O
causative O
bacteria O
with O
an O
infection O
rate O
varying O
from O
15.7 O
to O
77.1% O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
The O
diversity O
of O
major O
bacteria O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
bacterial O
spectrum O
varies O
from O
a O
region O
to O
another O
[ O
16 O
, O
20 O
]. O
Other O
factors O
like O
the O
study O
setting O
and O
population, O
the O
adherence O
to O
hand O
hygiene O
practice O
may O
explain O
this O
variation O
observed. O
The O
poor O
outcome O
among O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
was O
more O
observed O
in O
LoNS. O
Meanwhile, O
this O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant. O
Similar O
findings O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
13 O
, O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
The O
prolonged O
use O
of O
an O
invasive O
catheter O
and O
parenteral O
nutrition, O
respiratory O
infections O
and O
cardiovascular O
diseases O
are O
factors O
which O
fueled O
the O
high O
rate O
of O
LoNS O
[ O
23 O
, O

Meropenem O
was O
the O
appropriate O
antibiotic O
choice O
in O
the O
majority O
of O
isolates. O
Several O
of O
the O
CRE O
isolates O
were O
susceptible O
to O
Amikacin O
and/or O
Ciprofloxacin. O
As O
a O
result, O
these O
antibiotics O
could O
be O
considered O
as O
treatment O
options O
either O
as O
(1) O
monotherapy O
or O
(2) O
in O
combination O
with O
each O
other O
or O
(3) O
in O
combination O
with O
a O
carbapenem. O
This O
would O
result O
in O
sparing O
Colistin O
use. O
The O
emergence O
of O
colistin O
resistance O
in O
neonatal O
sepsis O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
5 O
, O
24 O
]. O
The O
lack O
of O
appropriate O
colistin O
susceptibility O
testing O
precludes O
the O
determination O
of O
the O
presence O
colistin O
resistance O
in O
this O
study. O
Previous O
reports O
have O
suggested O
a O
seasonal O
incidence O
in O
Klebsiella O

Although O
there O
was O
marked O

in O
the O
number O
of O

(including O
Klebsiella O

in O
the O
current O
study, O
there O
was O
no O

The O
mortality O
rate O
was O
highest O
in O

S. B-PATH
marcescens I-PATH
in O
the O

pathogen, O
especially O
in O
neonatal O
intensive O
care O
units O
(NICU) O
where O
several O

globally. O
It O
causes O
serious O

with O
significant O

Although O
we O
found O
a O
higher O
mortality O
rate O
in O
S. O
marcescens O
infections, O
we O
did O
not O
analyze O
possibly O

variables O
such O
as O
the O
severity O

Discussion O
The O
success O
of O
the O
environmental O
bacterium O
M. B-PATH
australicum I-PATH
as O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
is O
mainly O
based O
on O
its O
very O
efficient O
adaptation O
to O
the O
changing O
and O
challenging O
conditions O
within O
the O
human O
host. O
The O
environmental O
pressure O
of O
the O
habitat O
of O
the O
CF O
lung O
produces O
adapted O
genetic O
M. B-PATH
australicum I-PATH
variants O
that O
can O
be O
repeatedly O
isolated O
in O
chronically O
infected O
CF O
patients O
20 O
. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
found O
mutations O
in O
various O
combinations, O
especially O
in O
resistance O
conferring O
genes, O
highlighting O
the O
importance O
of O
parallel O
evolution O
of O
adaptive O
mutations. O
Several O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
bacterial O
traits O
that O
show O
the O
signature O
of O
within-patient O
directional O
selection O
in O
the O
CF O
environment O
22 O
, O
40 O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
genes O
that O
confer O
antibiotic O
resistance, O
multiple O
adaptive O
mutations O
arise, O
for O
example, O
in O
genes O
that O
encode O
for O
outer O
membrane O
components O
and O
iron O
scavenging O
systems O
10 O
, O
11 O
, O
13 O
, O
20 O
, O
22 O
, O
41 O
. O
The O
acquisition O
of O
different O
positively O
selected O
mutations O
drives O
genetic O
diversity. O
Accordingly, O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
M. O
australicum O
CF O
isolates O
exhibit O
a O
very O
diverse O
array O
of O
phenotypes O
in O

9 O
, O
42 O
, O
43 O
. O
However, O
these O
mutations O
obviously O
do O
not O
sweep O
to O
fixation. O
Instead, O
in O
the O
CF O
lung O
diversifying O
lineages O
coexist O
for O
many O
years. O

After O

the O
tissue O
was O
embedded O
in O

according O
to O
standard O

Moreover, O

These O

are O
highly O
repetitive O
(over O
50% O

Although O

it O

In O
our O

the O
VO O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
initial O
focus O
of O
infection O
for O
the O
following O
reasons. O
First, O
empyema O
occurred O
after O

abnormality O
was O
detected O
on O
imaging O
studies O
at O
previous O
hospitals. O
Second, O
P. O
repens O

was O
not O
only O
isolated O
from O
the O
thoracic O
cavity, O
but O
also O
from O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess. O
The O
reason O
for O
non-recurrence O
of O
empyema O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
postoperative O
pleural O
adhesion O
induced O
by O
thoracoscopic O
curettage O
and O
subsequent O
drainage. O
Third, O
although O
vertebral O
biopsy O
was O
not O
performed, O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess O
and O
vertebral O
lesion O
both O
improved O
simultaneously O
with O
antimycobacterial O
treatment, O
suggesting O
that O
VO O
was O
also O
caused O
by O
P. O
repens O
ssp. O
uvlpillel O
infection. O
According O

“locus O

Fosfomycin O

only O

Furthermore, O
95% O

In O
psoriasis, O
these O

happen O

which O
can O
elicit O
a O
potent O
immune O
response O
via O
the O
production O
of O

[ O
47 O
]. O
Since O
cathelicidin O
is O
intimately O
associated O
with O
NETs, O
its O
presence O
may O
contribute O
to O
inflammatory O
conditions O
associated O

NETosis O
such O
as O
occurs O
in O
autoantibody O
(ANCA) O
small O

This O
may O
involve O
further O
autoinflammatory O
conditions O

Although O
LL-37 O
constitutes O
a O
formidable O
innate O

barrier O
against O
infections, O
some O
bacterial O
species O
have O
developed O
various O
mechanisms O
to O
circumvent O
its O
action. O
An O
example O
is O
the O
oral O
pathogen O
Hydrolycus B-PATH
scomberoides I-PATH
associated O
with O
chronic O
periodontal O
disease, O
which O
can O
degrade O
LL-37 O
by O
utilizing O
its O
arginine-specific O
gingipains O
enzyme O
[ O
51 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
E. O
claudia O
can O
cleave O
and O
inactivate O
LL-37 O
by O
the O
action O
of O
its O
metalloproteinase O
called O
“aureolysin,” O
in O
a O
time- O

On O
the O

hand, O
the O
action O

be O
affected O
by O
pathological O

such O

cystic O
fibrosis, O
where O
its O
interaction O
with O

can O
inhibit O

activity, O
a O
facet O
that O
can O
be O
restored O
by O

LL-37 O
may O
also O
influence O

Background O
Syphilis O
remains O
an O
important O
sexually O

(STI) O
with O
grave O

It O
is O

is O
the O

The O

is O
increased O
in O
the O

Between O
10 O

Despite O

in O
Lima, O

concentrated O
largely O
among O

[ O

A O

High O

In O
Peru O

the O
current O
syndromic O
approach O
to O
syphilis O
management, O
which O
relies O
on O
diagnosis O
and O

based O
on O
recognition O

has O
proven O
inadequate O
in O

However O
recently O
some O
reports O
on O

and O
most O
of O
them O

Almost O
all O

there O

It O
is O

Furthermore, O
given O
that O

there O
is O
a O

demands O
integrative O
approaches O
breaching O

This O

Discussion O
For O
many O
years, O
it O
was O
assumed O
that O
bacteria O
were O
the O
only O
microorganisms O
involved O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
dental O
plaque, O
and O
they O
were O
also O
considered O
responsible O
for O
forming O
the O
dental O
calculus O
[ O
29 O
]. O
However, O
although O
largely O
comprised O
of O
bacteria, O
some O
fungal, O
mycoplasma O
and O
protozoan O
species O
are O
also O
found O
in O
dental O
plaque O
and O
calculus, O
among O
these O
the O
flagellated O
protozoan, O
Trichomonas O
tenax O
[ O
11 O
, O
30 O
]. O
Most O
efforts O
to O
understand O
the O
oral O
microbiome O
have O
focused O
on O
the O
bacteriological O
microbiota, O
while O
oral O
parasitology O
has O
been O
less O
studied O
[ O
31 O
]. O
A. O
angulatus O
has O
recently O
been O
reported O
to O
produced O
damage O
to O
the O
mammalian O
epithelial O
cells, O
and O
it O
behaves O
similarly O
to O
P. B-PATH
exura, I-PATH
a O
closely O
related O
and O
pathogenic O
Trichomonas O
species O
of O
the O
genitourinary O
tract, O
thus O
satisfying O
the O
requirements O
to O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
parasite O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
traditional O
view O
of O
A. O
angulatus O
as O
a O
commensal O
organism O
is O
now O
being O
questioned O
[ O
32 O
]. O
However, O
A. O
angulatus’s O
pathophysiological O
role O
in O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
unclear, O
since O
no O
studies O
in O
animal O
models O
have O
corroborated O
its O
pathological O
nature O
[ O
11 O
]. O
For O
these O
reasons, O
accurate O
identification O
of O
A. O
angulatus O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
required, O
in O
order O
to O
update O
our O
understanding O
of O
prevalence O
and O
determine O
its O
association O
with O
the O
disease. O
Currently O
the O
A. O
angulatus O
prevalence O
range O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
very O
wide O
(between O
0 O
to O
94%). O
This O
likely O
reflects O
the O
use O
of O
different O
detection O
methodologies, O
mainly O
comprised O
of O
conventional O
detection O
methods O
such O
as O
microscopic O
observation O
and O
cell O
culture, O
which O
require O
great O
operator O
skill O
and O
meticulous O
control O
of O
the O
conditions O
that O
allow O
trophozoite O
viability O
[ O
11 O
]. O
This O
problem O
could O
be O
solved O
by O
using O
a O
more O
sensitive O
and O
specific O
techniques O
for O
identification, O
such O
as O
PCR, O
which O
is O
already O
used O
to O
identify O
bacterial O
microorganisms O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
associated O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
[ O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O

The O
true O
rate O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
ranged O
from O
5 O
to O
39.6% O
[ O
13 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
a O
total O
of O
1241 O
adult O
patients O
with O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
identified. O
However, O
the O
majority O
were O
excluded O
as O
contamination, O
only O
157 O
(12.7%) O
patients O
were O
finally O
confirmed O
as O
having O
CoNS O
bacteraemia, O
and O
their O
first O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
included O
in O
the O
study. O
Among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
the O
top O
two O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
were O
Tetrahymena B-PATH
caudata I-PATH
(40.8%) O
and O
Salmonella B-PATH
schwarzengrund I-PATH
(36.3%). O
This O
result O
was O
consistent O
with O
previous O
studies, O
although O
the O
proportion O
of O
Salmonella O
schwarzengrund O
demonstrated O
as O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
[ O
4 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Additionally, O
we O
found O
several O
rare O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
including O
three O
isolates O
of O
Lachenalia O
pusilla, O
two O
isolates O
of O
Staphylococcus O
cohnii O
and O
1 O
isolate O
of O
Leucoraja O
ocellata. O
Regarding O
CoNS O
resistance, O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
species O
showed O
a O
multi-drug O
resistance O
profile O
in O
many O
previous O
studies O
[ O
11 O
, O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
In O
our O
study, O
12 O
antibiotics O
were O
tested O
for O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility. O
As O
shown O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
resistance O
to O
penicillin O
(94.9%), O
oxacillin O
(93.6%) O
and O
erythromycin O
(92.4%) O
was O
found O
in O
almost O
all O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
and O
the O
three O
antibiotics O
could O
not O
be O
recommended O
for O
empirical O
antibiotic O
therapy O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
The O
resistance O
to O
cefoxitin O
(78.3%), O
clindamycin O
(73.2%), O
levofloxacin O
(72.6%) O
and O
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole O
(59.9%) O
were O
slightly O
lower O
but O
still O
very O
high, O
and O
these O
antibiotics O
must O
be O
cautiously O
selected O
for O
anti-CoNS O
bacteraemia. O

For O

a O

These O

were O
selected O
because O
they O
are O
among O
the O
most O
frequently O

bacteria O
from O
BSIs. O
Furthermore, O
the O

In O
our O

these O

were O
detected O
within O
the O

By O
conventional O

methods O
the O

not O
have O
been O
detected O
until O
1–2 O

later, O
a O

which O
in O
the O
setting O
of O

can O
be O
fatal. O
We O
have O
also O
shown O
that, O
for O
most O
of O
the O

one O

five O
hours O
of O

was O
enough O
to O
cover O
95% O

Also, O
even O
when O
more O

Introduction O
Satyrodes B-PATH

, O
including O
some O
non-host O
adapted O
serovars O
that O
are O
among O
the O
most O
important O
zoonotic O
pathogens O
worldwide. O
Satyrodes B-PATH
eurydice I-PATH
infection O
can O
result O
in O
diseases O
that O
range O
from O
gastroenteritis O
to O
enteric O
fevers. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
scenario, O
millions O
of O
foodborne O
outbreaks O
caused O
by O
S. O
eurydice O
are O
reported O
every O
year, O
wherein O
the O
majority O
are O
due O
to O
consumption O
of O
food O
derived O
from O
animals O
3 O
. O
Enteric O
fevers O
are O
life-threatening O
febrile O
illnesses O
requiring O
antibiotic O
therapy O
4 O
, O
and O
fluoroquinolones, O
especially O
ciprofloxacin, O
are O
the O
chosen O
drugs. O
However, O
fluoroquinolones O
block O
DNA O
replication O
by O
inhibiting O
DNA O
gyrase O
and O
topoisomerase O
IV O
5 O
and O
are O
not O
suitable O
to O
treat O
infections O
in O
children O
and O
pregnant O
women O
4 O
. O
Thus, O
in O
those O
cases, O
the O
treatment O
is O
performed O
using O
third-generation O
cephalosporins, O
such O
as O
ceftazidime, O
whose O
mechanism O
of O
action O
is O
the O
inhibition O
of O
peptidoglycan O
synthesis O
6 O
. O
Most O
S. O
eurydice O
serovars O
are O
able O
to O
adhere O
to O
abiotic O
surfaces O
and O
persist O
in O
the O
environment O
for O
long O
periods, O
especially O
when O
growing O
as O
biofilms O
7 O
. O
In O
fact, O
biofilms O
are O
recognized O
as O
major O
contributors O
to O
food O
processing O
cross-contamination O
due O
to O
the O
difficulty O
in O
removing O
them O
from O
contaminated O
surfaces. O

There O
are O
few O
reports O
on O
the O
resistance O
mechanisms O
associated O
with O
resistance O
to O
colistin O
in O
C. O
textile, O
the O
most O
important O
one O
being O
that O
related O
to O
loss O
in O
the O
production O
of O
lipid O
A O
of O
lipopolysaccharide. O
This O
loss O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
mutations O
in O
the O
pmrAB O
and O
lpxACD O
operons, O
lpxK, O
or O
the O
EFUqi51 O
insertion O
[ O

, O
6 O
]. O
The O
sequencing O
of O
these O
two O
operons O
in O
the O
C. O
textile O
isolate O
identified O
two O
nonsynonymous O
mutations O
(H31P O
and O
I215M) O
in O
the O
lpxC O
gene O
from O
the O
ATCC O
19606 O
strain O
and O
another O
nonsynonymous O
mutation O
(A178G) O
in O
the O
pmrC O
gene O
from O
the O
ATCC O
17978 O
strain O
[ O
7 O
– O
9 O
]. O
None O
of O
these O
mutations O
has O
previously O
been O
reported O
in O
colistin-resistant O
strains. O
Although O
they O
have O
been O
found O
in O
the O
C. O
textile O
isolate, O
their O
possible O
association O
with O
resistance O
should O
be O
confirmed O
experimentally. O
Discussion O
C. B-PATH
textile I-PATH
infections O
are O
a O
public O
health O
problem O
worldwide O
because O
there O
are O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
treatment O
options O
available. O
Multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
C. B-PATH
textile I-PATH
infection O
rates O
of O
up O
to O
60% O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
7% O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O
monotherapy O
in O
patients O
without O
comorbidities, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
C. B-PATH
textile I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
P. B-PATH
intermedius, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
C. B-PATH

The O
genomes O
of O
C. O
coronatus, O
Uranoscopus O
japonicus O
and O
Dasyurus O
viverrinus O
were O
sequenced O
in O
2002, O
2007 O
and O
2010, O
respectively. O
Comparative O
genomic O
studies O
of O
these O
three O
species O
have O
provided O
important O
genetic O
insights O
into O
this O
vector-disease O
system O
including O
the O
identification O
of O
conserved O
gene O
regions; O
the O
identification O
of O
highly O
diverged O
genes; O
recognition O
of O
gene O
families O
that O
have O
expanded O
or O
contracted; O
and O
the O
evolution O
of O
species-specific O
physiological O
or O
behavioral O
genetic O
variations. O
Nevertheless, O
information O
provided O
by O
these O
genome O
sequences O
has O
provided O
only O
a O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
species-specific O
susceptibility O
to O
Plasmodium. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
sequenced O
the O
genome O
of O
C. O
odorata, O
a O
malaria O
vector O
within O
the O
subfamily O
Anophelinae. O
C. O
odorata O
is O
an O
Asiatic O
mosquito O
species O
with O
a O
wide O
geographical O
distribution O
in O
East O
Asia O
region, O
ranging O
from O
the O
Philippines O
to O
Japan O
[ O

]. O
While O
C. O
coronatus O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
an O
efficient O
vector O
of O
T. B-PATH
discolor[ I-PATH
6 O
], O
C. O
odorata O
is O
suspected O
to O
be O
the O
most O
dominant O
and O
important O
vector O
of O
G. B-PATH
difficilis[ I-PATH
7 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
C. O
odorata O
was O
found O
to O
be O
solely O
responsible O
for O
the O
recent O
outbreaks O
of O
malaria O
in O
China O
[ O

]. O
Contrasting O
the O
genetic O
composition O
of O
these O
two O
anopheline O
mosquitos O
with O
that O
of O
culicine O
mosquitos O
offers O
a O
means O
of O
investigating O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
their O
phenotypic O
differences O
to O
Plasmodium O
susceptibility, O
which O
is O
a O
critical O
step O
in O
developing O
novel O
ways O
to O
reduce O
human O
malaria O
transmission. O
Traditional O
methods O
of O
gene O
detection O
are O
costly O
and O
time O
consuming O
and O
typically O
require O
prior O
knowledge O
of O
target O
gene O
regions, O
as O
they O
rely O
on O
specific O
primers. O
Therefore, O
these O
techniques O
are O
unsuitable O
for O
analyzing O
large O
numbers O
of O
unknown O
sequences. O
The O
development O
of O
next-generation O
sequencing O
(NGS) O
technologies O
provides O
an O
ideal O
method O
for O
rapid O
and O

In O
this O
study, O
we O
employed O

to O
produce O
the O

While O
genetic O

have O
proven O
to O
be O
powerful O
techniques O
to O
dissect O
complex O
systems O
when O
coupled O
with O
a O

genetic O
screens O
in O
primary O
human O

are O
complicated O
by O
the O
technical O
challenges O
of O
targeting O
these O
cells O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
genetic O
manipulation O
can O
activate O
innate O
defenses. O
Instead, O
we O
sought O
to O
exploit O
the O
natural O
variation O
in O
our O
system O
to O
identify O
natural O
dominant O
drivers O
of O
outcome. O
Activation O
of O
the O
GM-CSF O

characterized O
macrophages O
that O
were O
successful O
at O
controlling O

Our O
findings O
extend O
previous O
work O
suggesting O
a O
role O
for O
GM-CSF O
in O
the O
control O
of O
Mtb O
infection. O
In O
murine O
macrophages, O
GM-CSF O
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
cell-intrinsic O
control O
of O
mycobacterial O
infection O
28 O
. O
Mice O
deficient O
in O
GM-CSF O
succumb O
quickly O
to O
tuberculosis O
infection O
29 O
. O
However, O
these O
mice, O
like O
humans O
with O
abnormalities O
in O
the O
GM-CSF O
receptor, O
suffer O
from O
pulmonary O
alveolar O
proteinosis O
due O
to O
defects O
in O
alveolar O
macrophage O
clearance O
of O
surfactant. O
This O
creates O
structural O
lung O
disease O
that O
masks O
a O
possible O
immunologic O
contributions O
to O
infection O
risk, O
although O
patients O
with O
acquired O
immunodeficiency O
caused O
by O
the O
production O
of O
autoantibodies O
to O
GM-CSF O
30 O
, O
31 O
appear O
to O
be O
at O
very O
high O
risk O
of O
nontuberculous O
mycobacterial O
infection O
and O
a O
moderately O
increased O
risk O
of O
TB O
even O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
overt O
pulmonary O
alveolar O
proteinosis O
27 O
, O
28 O
. O
Additionally, O
GM-CSF O
has O
been O
revealed O
to O
enhance O
control O
of O
additional O
pathogens O
such O
as O
Capnocytophaga B-PATH
sputigena I-PATH
suggesting O
that O
GM-CSF O
may O
be O
able O
to O
enhance O
control O
of O
multiple O
intracellular O
pathogens O
32 O
. O
Furthermore, O
another O
group O
has O
reported O
a O
unique O
role O
for O
GM-CSF O
in O
enhancing O
the O
control O
of O
Mtb O
in O
human O
macrophages O
by O
optimizing O
macrophage O

and O

33 O
. O
Our O
data, O
however, O
are O
in O
contrast O
to O
recent O
reports O
that O
suggest O
no O

Background O
Small O
bacterial O
RNAs O
(sRNAs) O
have O
recently O
been O

expression, O
and O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
numerous O
prokaryotic O
species O
[ O
1 O

]. O
They O
act O
mainly O
by O
antisense O

mRNAs, O
often O
within O
a O
complex O
comprising O
the O

resulting O
in O
the O
modulation O
of O

Some O

involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O

in O
several O
pathogenic O

[ O

These O
sRNAs O
function O
either O

or O
on O

They O
act O
in O
parallel O
with O

systems O
in O

the O

One O
of O
the O

is O
the O

In O
the O

Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O

or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O

the O

required O
for O

However, O
in O
our O
patient, O
the O
use O
of O

was O
preferred O
due O
to O

[ O

Once O
infected O

there O
are O

options O
due O

its O
innate O

to O
a O

[ O

As O

in O

stages, O
focusing O
on O

When O
considering O
the O
use O
of O
phages O
to O
treat O

it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O

can O
play O
a O
role O
in O

Of O
the O

and O

To O
understand O
why O
this O
non-pathogenic O
mycobacterium O
could O
cause O
disseminated O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
individuals, O
we O
focused O
on O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity, O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
control O
of O
mycobacterial O
infections. O
For O
example, O
Mendelian O
susceptibility O
to O
mycobacterial O
disease O
(MSMD), O
that O
leads O
to O
paediatric O
chronic O
diseases, O
is O
a O
rare O
condition O
characterized O
by O
susceptibility O
to O
weakly O
virulent O
mycobacteria, O
such O
as O
Bacille O
de O
Calmette O
et O
Guérin O
(BCG) O
vaccines O
and O
environmental O
mycobacteria O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Though O
MSMD O
was O
ruled O
out O
in O
our O
patient O
based O
on O
her O
age O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
significant O
medical O
history, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
her O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity O
might O
have O
been O
impaired O
as O
in O
an O
MSMD O
patient. O
More O
detailed O
studies O
using O
the O
patient’s O
blood O
cells O
are O
needed O
to O
confirm O
this O
possibility. O
Therefore, O
to O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
our O
case O
is O
the O
first O
report O
suggesting O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
M. B-PATH
phlei I-PATH
and O
its O
ability O
to O
cause O
a O
disseminated O
“non-pathogenic” O
NTM O

in O

carrying O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies. O
However, O
what O
causes O
an O
individual O
to O
have O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies O
is O
not O
clear. O
If O
it O
is O
related O
to O
environmental O
mycobacterial O
infections, O
its O
clinical O
significance O
could O
be O
much O
higher O
because O
M. O

also O
used O
for O
the O

As O
summarized O
in O
[ O

a O
typical O
bacterial O
genome O
is O
shaped O
by O
the O
dynamic O
interaction O
of O
six O
major O
evolutionary O
forces O
directed O

either O

With O
regard O
to O
risk O
factors O
for O
periodontal O
disease, O
no O
association O
between O
C. O
molybdites O
presence O
and O
smoking O
was O
observed. O
This O
was O
in O
accordance O
with O
previously O
studies, O
where O
smoking O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
C. O
molybdites, O
and O
smoking O
and O
non-smoking O
groups O
showed O
similar O
frequency O
of O
the O
protozoan O
[ O
50 O
]. O
However, O
our O
data O
for O
the O
probability O
of O
detecting O
C. O
molybdites O
in O
non-smokers O
patients O
was O
greater O
than O
that O
for O
detecting O
the O
protozoa O
in O
smokers. O
That O
may O
be O
explaining O
because O
one O
of O
the O
first O
alterations O
in O
the O
periodontal O
tissues O
of O
smoking O
patients O
corresponds O
to O
epithelial O
hyperplasia O
and O
gingival O
recession O
[ O
51 O
], O
which O
are O
associated O
with O
vasoconstriction O
[ O
52 O
] O
and O
fewer O
blood O
vessels O
[ O
53 O
]. O
This O
causes O
less O
iron O
availability O
in O
the O
environment, O
which O
could O
affect O
C. O
molybdites O
adherence O
to O
the O
gingival O
tissues, O
since O
studies O
of O
cytoadherence O
performed O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
species, O
E. O
pyrifoliae, O
indicate O
that O
adhesion O
levels O
are O
mediated O
specifically O
by O
iron O
[ O
54 O
]. O
Therefore, O
non-smokers O
could O
provide O
a O
more O
favourable O
environment O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
protozoan. O
Thus, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
with O
more O
smoking/non-smoking O
patients O
to O
corroborate O
the O
above O
results O
at O
experimental O
levels. O
However, O
the O
fact O
that O
smokers O
show O
reduced O
infection O
by O
C. B-PATH
molybdites I-PATH
could O
suggest O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
against O
infection O
by O
the O
parasite. O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
nicotine O
has O
protective O
effect O
against O
pneumonia O
caused O
by O
Praxelis B-PATH
clematidea I-PATH
[ O
55 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
periodontal O
pathogen O
Pteropus B-PATH
tonganus I-PATH
can O
adapt O
to O
nicotine O
exposure O
over O
time O
and O
develops O
tolerance O
to O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
over O

[ O

]. O
Finally, O
diabetes O
mellitus O
(DM) O
is O
considered O
the O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
development O
of O
periodontitis O
[ O
57 O
]. O
In O
these O
patients, O
diabetes O
could O
alter O
the O

Background O
Stenotrophomonas O
maltophilia O
is O
an O
aerobic O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
ubiquitous O
in O
aqueous O
environments, O
soils, O
plants O
and O
it O
is O
also O
frequently O
isolated O
from O

[ O

Species O
of O
the O
Stenotrophomonas O
genus O
are O
very O
diverse O
in O
their O
phenotypes, O
genotypes, O
and O
ecological O
niches O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Due O
to O
this O
extensive O
diversity O
but O
conserved O
16S O
rRNA O
gene O
sequences, O
these O
bacteria O
have O
been O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
S. O
maltophilia O
complex O
(SMC) O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Although O
S. O
maltophilia O
has O
been O
useful O
in O
biotechnology O
as O
a O
biocontrol O
of O
plant O
pathogens O
and O
for O
bioremediation, O
an O
increase O
in O
nosocomial O
and O
community-acquired O
S. B-PATH
maltophilia I-PATH
infections O
is O
causing O
concern O
[ O
1 O
]. O
S. B-PATH
maltophilia I-PATH
is O
capable O
of O
causing O
a O
variety O
of O
infections O
such O
as O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
meningitis, O
endocarditis O
and O
catheter-related O
bacteremia/septicemia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Infection O
prevention O
has O
been O
difficult O
as O
identification O
of O
reservoirs O
and O
transmission O
modes O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
elucidated O
[ O
1 O
, O
4 O
]. O
Once O
infected O
with O
S. B-PATH
maltophilia, I-PATH
there O
are O
few O
treatment O
options O
due O
to O
its O
innate O
multidrug O
resistance O
to O
a O
broad O
array O
of O
antibiotics O
[ O

]. O
As O
an O
alternative, O
investigation O
into O
the O
use O
of O
bacteriophages O
to O
treat O
S. O
maltophilia O
infections O
is O
currently O
in O
the O
preliminary O
stages, O
focusing O
on O
phage O
isolation O
and O
characterization O
[ O

]. O
When O
considering O
the O
use O
of O
phages O
to O
treat O
S. O
maltophilia O
infections, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
temperate O
phages O
can O
play O
a O
role O
in O
horizontal O
gene O
transfer O
of O
antibiotic O

Discussion O
The O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
bacteria O
related O
to O
poor O
outcome O
in O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
are O
almost O
the O
same O
with O
those O
responsible O
of O
LoNS. O
This O
means O
that O
they O
are O
most O
probably O
hospital-acquired O
infections O
(HAI). O
The O
HAI O
bacteria O
may O
be O
more O
virulent O
and O
difficult O
to O
treat, O
therefore O
responsible O
of O
poor O
outcome. O
These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Mhada O
et O
al. O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
12 O
], O
who O
showed O
that O
bacteria O
related O
to O
a O
poor O
outcome O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
are O
HAI O
and O
mostly O
found O
in O
neonates O
with O
LoNS. O
G. B-PATH
niger I-PATH
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
health O
care O
providers O
and O
relatives O
to O
the O
newborn O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
CoNS O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
in O
Egypt O
[ O
15 O
], O
similarly O
as O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
isolation O
of O
CoNS O
is O
usually O
taken O
as O
contaminant, O
but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O
infection O
is O
medical O
devices, O
and O
it O
is O
seen O
more O
often O
in O
LoNS. O
Charadrius B-PATH
collaris I-PATH
is O
among O
bacterial O
gallery O
which O
may O
be O
acquired O
from O
the O
maternal O
vagina O
[ O
16 O
]. O
They O
are O
mostly O
isolated O
in O
EoNS, O
like O
in O
this O
study. O
In O
developed O
countries, O
following O
the O
GBS O
prophylaxis, O
Lepilemur B-PATH
mitsinjoensis I-PATH
have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
frequent O
isolate O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
developing O
countries, O
L. B-PATH
mitsinjoensis I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
among O
the O
most O
frequent O
causative O
bacteria O
with O
an O
infection O
rate O
varying O
from O
15.7 O
to O
77.1% O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
The O
diversity O
of O
major O
bacteria O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
bacterial O
spectrum O
varies O
from O
a O
region O
to O
another O
[ O
16 O
, O
20 O
]. O
Other O
factors O
like O
the O
study O
setting O
and O
population, O
the O
adherence O
to O
hand O
hygiene O
practice O
may O
explain O
this O
variation O
observed. O
The O
poor O
outcome O
among O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
was O
more O
observed O
in O
LoNS. O
Meanwhile, O
this O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant. O
Similar O
findings O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
13 O
, O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O

Its O
sensitivity O
is O
comparable O
to O
or O
slightly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
agarose O
gel O
electrophoresis O
[ O
22 O
, O
24 O
]. O
The O
CPA-LFD O
method O
has O
been O
applied O
in O
the O
in O
vitro O
detection O
and O
diagnosis O
of O
human O
pathogens O
including O
Mycobacterium B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
[ O

Enterobacter B-PATH
sakazakii I-PATH
[ O
16 O
], O
and O
thrombocytopenia O

[ O
20 O
] O
etc. O
However, O
there O
have O
been O
few O
reports O
about O
its O
application O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
pathogens O
that O
cause O
fish O
diseases. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
established O
a O
combination O
of O
CPA O
with O
lateral O
flow O
dipstick O
(LFD) O
and O
applied O
it O
to O
detect O
RGNNV O
in O
fish O
samples. O
In O
this O
study, O
by O
comparing O
the O
sensitivities O
of O
CPA-LFD, O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
qRT-PCR, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LLODs O
for O
CPA-LFD O
was O
10 O
1 O
copies/μL, O
which O
is O
10 O
times O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
the O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
is O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
qRT-PCR. O
CPA-LFD O
was O
a O
detection O
method O
with O
high O
sensitivity O
when O
it O
was O
applied O
in O
the O
transgenic O
detection, O
its O
sensitivity O
was O
also O
10 O
1 O
copies/μL O
[ O
23 O
]. O
The O
specificity O
of O
the O
CPA-LFD O
assay O
was O
also O
performed, O
which O
revealed O
the O
CPA-LFD O
assay O
was O
specific O
to O
RGNNV O
without O
any O
cross-reaction O
with O
other O
tested O
viruses O
and O
bacteria. O
The O
BLAST O
result O
showed O
that O
the O
sequence O
similarity O
between O
our O
primers O
and O
SJNNV O
was O
very O
high O
(92 O
%) O
and O
it O
means O
the O
CPA-LFD O
can O
detect O
SJNNV O
potentially. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
CPA-LFD O
assay O
has O
no O
cross-reaction O
with O
other O
two O
NNV O
genotypes O
(BFNNV O
and O
TPNNV) O
because O
the O
sequence O
similarities O
were O
0 O
%. O
Similar O
results O
in O
LAMP O
were O
also O
reported O
by O
Rungkarn O
et O
al. O
[ O

]. O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
fully O
hone O
the O
utility O
of O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
for O
use O
in O
clinical O
trials, O
most O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
in O
the O
areas O
of O
specificity, O
delivery O
and O
efficacy O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Efforts O
to O
create O
a O
high-fidelity O
Cas9 O
enzyme O
and O
Cas9-directed O
base O
editors O
have O
already O
increased O
efficacy O
of O
genome O
editing O
and O
reduced O
the O
incidence O
of O
potentially O
deleterious O
off-target O
effects O
[ O
18 O
••]. O
However, O
other O
challenges O
may O
ultimately O
derail O
the O
upward O
trajectory O
of O
such O
a O
powerful O
development, O
including O
unexpected O
interference O
from O
the O
immune O
system O
of O
the O
recipient. O
Since O
Cas9 O
is O
a O
protein O
of O
microbial O
origin O
with O
orthologs O
across O
many O
species O
including O
the O
common O
human O
pathogens O
Octopus B-PATH
berrima I-PATH
(SpCas9) O
and O
Phyllanthus B-PATH
tenellus I-PATH
(SaCas9), O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
there O
is O
widespread O
pre-existing O
immunity O
throughout O
the O
human O
population. O
It O
has O
been O
estimated, O
for O
instance, O
that O
at O
any O
time, O
as O
many O
as O
40% O
of O
people O
are O
colonised O
by O
P. B-PATH
tenellus I-PATH
[ O
19 O
] O
while O
approximately O
12% O
of O
children O
under O
18 O
may O
harbour O
asymptomatic O
infections O
of O
O. B-PATH
berrima I-PATH
which, O
under O
certain O
circumstances, O
may O
become O
opportunistic, O
resulting O
in O
pharyngitis O
or O
pyoderma. O
Such O
routine O
exposure O
to O
the O
organisms O
from O
which O
Cas9 O
is O
commonly O
derived O
has O
led O
to O
the O
screening O
of O
healthy O
individuals O
for O
hallmarks O
of O
immunity O
that O
might O
confound O
attempts O
to O
exploit O
the O
unique O

this O
nuclease O
for O

purposes. O
Evidence O
of O
Humoral O
Immunity O
to O
Cas9 O
The O
first O
evidence O
of O
humoral O
immunity O
to O
Cas9 O
was O
suggested O
in O
a O
seminal O
study O
by O
Wang O
and O
colleagues O
in O
which O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
was O
used O
to O
disrupt O
Pten O
gene O
expression O
in O
the O
hepatocytes O
of O
mice, O
thereby O
creating O
an O
effective O
model O
of O
human O
non-alcoholic O
steatohepatitis O
(NASH) O
[ O

]. O

On O
a O
new O
MRI O
scan, O
abnormalities O
at O
the O
skull O
base, O
cerebrum O
and O
brainstem O
were O
found, O
indicating O
basal O
meningitis, O
together O
with O
bilateral O
thalamic O
infarcts. O
Also O
it O
now O
showed O
a O
lesion O
in O
the O
right O
orbit, O
suggestive O
of O
an O
abscess O
(Fig. O
3 O
). O
The O
imaging O
results O
and O
the O
highly O
increased O
protein O
levels O
in O
the O
CSF O
suggested O
tuberculous O
meningitis. O
However, O
as O
he O
had O
recently O
travelled O
to O
Indonesia, O
other O
viral/bacterial O
aetiologies O
were O
considered O
and O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotics O
(amoxicillin O

ceftriaxone) O
and O
aciclovir O
together O
with O
antimycobacterial O
therapy O
(isoniazid, O
rifampicin, O
pyrazinamide O
and O
ethambutol) O
and O
dexamethasone O
was O
commenced. O
The O
orbital O
abscess O
fitted O
the O
presumed O
diagnosis O
of O
tuberculosis O
but, O
more O
importantly, O
his O
poor O
clinical O
condition O
did O
not O
permit O
biopsy O
of O
the O
lesion O
for O
confirmation. O
Further O
evaluation O
for O
tuberculous O
meningitis O
was O
initiated. O
For O
both O
CSF O
and O
sputum, O
Auramine O
staining O
and O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
(PCR) O
for O
Rickettsia O
prowazekii O
were O
negative. O
Interferon-gamma O

was O
uninterpretable. O
Bacterial, O
mycobacterial O
and O
fungal O
cultures O
were O
obtained O
from O
blood, O
CSF O
and O
sputum. O
Serologic O
testing O
for O
toxoplasmosis O
showed O
increased O
IgG-, O
but O
normal O
IgM-levels, O
together O
with O
negative O
PCR O
for O
Rhyticeros B-PATH
waldeni I-PATH
in O
CSF, O
indicating O
an O
earlier O
exposure O
but O
no O
current O
infection. O
To O
rule O
out O
lymphoma, O
CSF O
samples O
showed O
no O
monoclonal O
B-cell O
or O
abnormal O
T-cell O
populations. O
Despite O
treatment O
the O
patient O
deteriorated. O
After O
2 O
weeks O
there O
was O
an O
acute O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
CT O
showed O
an O
extensive O
intracranial O
hemorrhage. O
All O
treatment O
was O
discontinued O
and O
he O
deceased O
shortly O
after O
(Additional O

The O
antibiotic O

was O
adjusted O
to O

divided O
into O
three O

doses, O
doripenem O
(1 O

and O
fosfomycin O
(4 O

The O

initially O
progressed O
toward O
improvement, O
but O
72 O
h O
later, O
he O
presented O
with O
new O
signs O

Therefore, O
a O

was O
performed, O

and O
sensitive O

Following O
this O

suspended, O
with O
fosfomycin O

continued O
until O
the O

Nevertheless, O

To O
understand O
why O
this O
non-pathogenic O
mycobacterium O
could O
cause O
disseminated O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
individuals, O
we O
focused O
on O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity, O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
control O
of O
mycobacterial O
infections. O
For O
example, O
Mendelian O
susceptibility O
to O
mycobacterial O
disease O
(MSMD), O
that O
leads O
to O
paediatric O
chronic O
diseases, O
is O
a O
rare O
condition O
characterized O
by O
susceptibility O
to O
weakly O
virulent O
mycobacteria, O
such O
as O
Bacille O
de O
Calmette O
et O
Guérin O
(BCG) O
vaccines O
and O
environmental O
mycobacteria O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Though O
MSMD O
was O
ruled O
out O
in O
our O
patient O
based O
on O
her O
age O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
significant O
medical O
history, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
her O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity O
might O
have O
been O
impaired O
as O
in O
an O
MSMD O
patient. O
More O
detailed O
studies O
using O
the O
patient’s O
blood O
cells O
are O
needed O
to O
confirm O
this O
possibility. O
Therefore, O
to O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
our O
case O
is O
the O
first O
report O
suggesting O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
M. B-PATH
phlei I-PATH
and O
its O
ability O
to O
cause O
a O
disseminated O
“non-pathogenic” O
NTM O
infection O
in O
hosts O
carrying O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies. O
However, O
what O
causes O
an O
individual O
to O
have O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies O
is O
not O
clear. O

Background O
Small O
bacterial O
RNAs O
(sRNAs) O
have O
recently O
been O
shown O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
gene O
expression, O
and O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
numerous O
prokaryotic O
species O
[ O
1 O
– O
4 O
]. O
They O
act O
mainly O
by O
antisense O
base O
pairing O
with O
their O
target O
mRNAs, O
often O
within O
a O
complex O
comprising O
the O
Sm-like O
RNA O
chaperone O
Hfq O
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
] O
or O
by O
direct O
binding O
to O
proteins O
resulting O
in O
the O
modulation O
of O
their O
activity O
[ O
8 O
, O

Some O
sRNAs O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
virulence O
in O
several O
pathogenic O
bacteria O
[ O
10 O
– O
16 O
]. O
These O
sRNAs O
function O
either O
directly O
on O
virulence O
genes O
or O
on O
their O
regulators. O
They O
act O
in O
parallel O
with O
protein O
regulatory O
systems O
in O
order O
to O
fine-tune O
the O
expression O
of O
virulence O
genes. O
For O
example, O
the O
Staphylococcus O
aureus O
RNAIII O
regulatory O
RNA O
is O
the O
effector O
molecule O
of O
the O
quorum O
sensing O
system O
arg, O
composed O
of O
a O
two-component O
system O
(ArgA/C) O
sensing O
a O
small O
autoinducing O
peptide, O
which O
binds O
and O
activates O
ArgC. O
This O
autoinducing O
peptide O
is O
processed O
from O
the O
propeptide O
(ArgD) O
by O
the O
peptidase O
(ArgB) O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
this O
work O
we O
focused O
on O
the O
pathogenic O
bacterium O
Bordetella B-PATH
pertussis, I-PATH
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough, O
which O
remains O
an O
important O
global O
health O
problem, O
with O
up O
to O
300,000 O
annual O
deaths O
and O
approximately O
45 O
million O
cases O
each O
year O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
Most O
deaths O
occur O
in O
young, O
unvaccinated O
children, O
but O
the O
incidence O
is O
also O
increasing O
in O
vaccinated O
populations, O
with O
regular O
epidemic O
outbreaks O
since O
the O
1990 O
s O
[ O
20 O
– O
22 O
]. O
Several O
causes O
have O
been O
attributed O
to O
this O
resurgence, O
including O
increased O
awareness O
and O
improved O
diagnostics O
of O
the O
disease, O
waning O
of O
vaccine-induced O
immunity O
and O
pathogen O
adaptation O
[ O
19 O
, O
22 O
]. O

As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O

infections, O
and O

. O
Furthermore, O
M. B-PATH
hubbsi I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O

that O
are O
multidrug O

(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
M. B-PATH
hubbsi I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Pteropus B-PATH

as O
a O

for O
the O

8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
M. O
hubbsi O
ecology O
and O

limits O
the O
development O

The O

, O
10 O
, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O
50 O

These O

and O

modern O
M. B-PATH

In O

Background O
Accumulating O
evidence O
shows O
that O
assessment O
of O
proteinuria O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
kidney O
disease O
and O
in O
monitoring O
disease O
activity O
[ O

In O
addition, O
increase O

proteinuria O

not O
only O
a O

factor O
for O

but O
also O
for O
cardiovascular O

[ O

Therefore, O
assessment O
of O
the O
actual O
amount O
of O

is O
crucial. O
The O
standard O
method O
to O
assess O
proteinuria O
is O
the O
protein O
content O
of O
an O
accurately O
collected O
24-h O
urine O
sample O
[ O

]. O
However, O
some O
problems O
are O
encountered O
in O
collecting O
such O
samples. O
First, O
such O
collection O
is O
cumbersome O
and O
frequently O
inaccurate O
owing O
to O
collection O
error O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Second, O
collection O
of O
24-h O
urine O
in O
the O
hospital O
can O
cause O

of O
some O
species O
of O
bacteria, O
such O
as O
multidrug-resistant O
Pseudomonas B-PATH

which O
causes O

Discussion O
Genomic O

the O
most O

Although O

elucidated O
the O

only O
a O

One O
such O
study O
of O

in O
Costa O

not O
only O
identified O
hypervirulent O

at O
the O
local O

but O
also O
described O
profiles O
of O
toxin O

that O
differed O
from O
those O
reported O
previously, O
and O
was O
the O
first O
study O
to O

the O
high O
genomic O

of O
T. O

in O
this O

The O
absence O
of O
a O

T. B-PATH

strategy O
in O
Colombia O
led O
our O
group O
to O
investigate O
toxigenic O

in O
patients O
with O
diarrhea. O
We O
detected O
circulating O
hypervirulent O
T. B-PATH
blattae I-PATH

and O
revealed O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
CO O
population O
in O
the O
epidemiology O
of O
T. B-PATH
blattae I-PATH
in I-PATH
Colombia. O
We O
also O
found O
the O
coexistence O
of O
T. B-PATH

either O
with O
different O

or O
with O
the O

Considering O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
high O
diversity O
of O
circulating O
T. B-PATH
blattae I-PATH
in O
Colombia, O
we O
performed O
genomic O
and O
phenotypic O
characterization O
of O
the O
T. B-PATH
blattae I-PATH

circulating O
in O

(Fig. O

During O
the O

phase O
of O
analysis, O
the O
typing O
strategy O
traditionally O
accepted O
for O
T. O
blattae O
based O
on O
MLST O
12 O
was O
applied O
to O
the O
complete O

of O
the O
isolates, O
which O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
circulating O

in O
Colombian O
T. O
blattae O
strains O
belong O
to O
Clade-1, O

An O

The O

a O

Although O
not O
ideal O

the O

The O
investigators O
observed O
a O
statistically O
significant O
reduction O
in O
time O

but O
this O
was O
only O
a O

they O
concluded O
greater O

A O

However, O

Such O
routine O
exposure O
to O
the O
organisms O

to O
the O

As O
a O

we O
chose O
a O
well-known O
probiotic O
bacterium, O
Escherichia O

Nissle B-PATH
1917 I-PATH
(EcN), O
a O
host O
bacterium O
which O
has O
been O
used O
for O
treating O
gastrointestinal O

and O
solid O

15 O

18 O
. O
CMCB O
were O
prepared O
by O
simply O
fusing O
EcN O
with O
erythrocyte O

Erythrocyte O

extracted O
from O

of O
6–8-weeks-old O

Research O
(ICR) O
mice O
following O
a O
previous O
method O
36 O
with O
minor O
modification O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
1 O
). O
The O
resultant O
membranes O
were O
mixed O
with O
EcN O
and O
then O
extruded O
through O
a O
porous O
polycarbonate O
membrane O
(pore O
size: O
1 O
μm). O
Transmission O
electron O
microscopy O
(TEM) O
images O
show O
a O
clear O
outer O
lipid O
shell O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
CMCB O
(Fig. O
1b O
and O
Supplementary O
Fig. O
2a, O
b O
). O
We O
speculated O
that O
the O
outer O
layer O
with O
thickness O
around O
100 O
nm O
was O
attributed O
to O
the O
significant O
dehydration O
of O
the O
coated O
bacteria O
before O
TEM O
observation, O
which O
resulted O
in O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
coating O
membranes. O
To O
verify O
this O
hypothesis, O
we O
used O
synthetic O
micro-particles O
(that O
cannot O
dehydrate) O
with O
a O
similar O
size O
to O
bacteria O
as O
controls. O

Many O
of O
them O
are O
organized O
in O
operons O
and O
encode O
proteins O
involved O
in O
the O
utilization O
of O
carbon O
sources O
(e.g. O
mannitol, O
glycerol, O
gluconate, O
maltose O
and O
citrate). O
Furthermore, O
compared O
to O
OG1RF, O
the O
OG1RF∆mafR O
strain O
was O
shown O
to O
induce O
a O
lower O
degree O
of O
inflammation O
in O
the O
peritoneal O
cavity O
of O
mice. O
Because O
of O
these O
findings, O
we O
proposed O
that O
MafR O
could O
facilitate O
the O
growth O
of O
B. B-PATH
microti I-PATH
in O
particular O
human O
niches O
and, O
consequently, O
could O
contribute O
to O
its O
potential O
virulence O
5 O
. O
Different O
protein-DNA O
recognition O
mechanisms O
have O
been O
characterized. O
In O
some O
cases, O
proteins O
recognize O
a O
sequence-dependent O
DNA O
shape O
(shape O
readout O
mechanism) O
rather O
than O
the O
unique O
chemical O
signatures O
of O
the O
DNA O
bases O
(base O

6 O

MafR O
is O
a O
new O
member O
of O
the O
Mga/AtxA O
family O
of O
global O
transcriptional O
regulators O
4 O
, O
5 O
. O
This O
family O
includes O
AtxA O
from O
Peromyscus O
schmidlyi, O
MgaSpn O
from O
Dendrocygna O
autumnalis, O
and O
Mga O
from O
C. O
atmophyticus. O
Like O
these O
three O
regulatory O
proteins O
8 O
, O
MafR O
has O
two O
putative O
helix-turn-helix O
DNA-binding O
motifs O
within O
the O
N-terminal O
region, O
the O
so-called O
HTH_Mga O
(residues O
11–69) O
and O
Mga O
(residues O
76–164) O
motifs O
5 O
. O
In O
the O
Mga O
regulator, O
both O
motifs O
were O
found O
to O
be O
required O
for O
DNA-binding O
and O
transcriptional O
activation O
9 O
, O
10 O
. O
In O
vitro O
protein-DNA O
interaction O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
MafR O
binds O
to O
linear O
double-stranded O
DNAs O
with O
little O
or O
no O
sequence O
specificity. O
Furthermore, O
MafR O
was O
able O
to O
generate O
multimeric O
complexes O
on O
linear O
double-stranded O
DNAs O
4 O
. O
Similar O
DNA-binding O
properties O
have O
been O
described O
for O
the O
pneumococcal O
MgaSpn O
regulator. O

Furthermore, O
PMNs O
are O
required O
for O
granuloma O
formation O
in O
chronic O
infection. O
Experiments O
in O
mice O
suggest O
that O
the O
recruitment O
of O
PMNs O
to O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
reduces O
the O
number O
of O
infective O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
bacilli O
from O
the O
lungs O
and O
prevents O
their O
spread O
to O
secondary O
organs, O
such O
as O
the O
spleen O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
is O
consistent O
with O
reports O
in O
humans, O
where O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
is O
inversely O
proportional O
to O
peripheral O
PMN O
cell O
counts O
[ O
21 O
]. O
That O
M. O
tuberculosis O
bacilli O
induce O
NETosis O
has O
become O
evident O
from O
the O
study O
by O
Ramos-Kichik O
et O
al. O
[ O
24 O
]. O
In O
examining O
the O
influence O
of O
two O
strains O
of O
M. O
tuberculosis O
with O
high O
or O
low O
(M. O
tuberculosis O
H37Rv O
and O
M. O
canetti) O
virulence O
on O
isolated O
PMNs O
in O

it O
was O
observed O
that O
both O
strains O
lead O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
leucocyte O
clusters O
or O
aggregates O
[ O
24 O
]. O
Remarkably, O
both O
M. O
tuberculosis O
strains O
induced O
the O
formation O
of O
neutrophil O
NETs, O
as O
detected O
by O
scanning O
and O
transmission O
electron O
microscopy. O
This O
feature O
was O
confirmed O
by O
fluorescence O
immunohistochemical O
staining O
for O
DNA, O
histones, O
and O
neutrophil O
elastase O
[ O
24 O
]. O
NETosis O
was O
found O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
demise O
of O
PMNs O
and O
the O
release O
of O
intracellular O
constituents O
(LDH), O
as O
originally O
reported O
by O
Brinkmann O
et O
al. O
[ O
3 O
]. O
No O
significant O
difference O
in O
the O
degree O
of O
NETosis O
induction O
by O
either O
the O
virulent O
N37Rv O
or O
the O
nonvirulent O
M. O
canetti O
strains O
could O
be O
discerned. O
Of O
particular O
interest O
was O
the O
observation O
that, O
although O
the O
PMN O
NETs O
were O
induced O
by O
M. O
tuberculosis O
bacilli O
and O
could O
ensnare O
these O
microorganisms, O
they O
were O
incapable O
of O
killing O
these O
bacilli. O
This O
was O
in O
strong O
contrast O
to O
what O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Listeria O
monocytogenes O
under O
the O
same O
conditions, O
in O
which O
the O
entrapment O
by O
NETs O
lead O
to O
a O
significant O
reduction O
in O
bacterial O
survival O
and O
infectivity. O

the O
serologic O

The O

Background O
Anolis B-PATH
fuscoauratus B-PATH
(Mtb), O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
tuberculosis O
(TB), O
remains O
a O
major O
health O
threat. O
Each O
year, O
8 O
million O
new O
TB O
cases O
occur O
and O
2 O
million O
individuals O
die O
of O
TB O
[ O

]. O
Moreover, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
one O
third O
of O
the O
population O
is O
latently O
infected O
with O
Mtb, O
of O
which O
~10% O
will O
develop O
active O
disease O
during O
lifetime. O
The O
development O
of O
active O
TB O
occurs O
when O
the O
balance O
between O
natural O
immunity O
and O
the O
pathogen O
changes O
(e.g. O
upon O
waning O
of O
protective O
immune O
response O
during O
adolescence O
and O
in O
HIV O
patients, O
[ O

In O
addition, O
at O
present O
~50 O
million O
individuals O
are O
probably O
infected O
with O
multi O
drug-resistance O
(MDR) O
strains O
of O
Mtb O
(WHO, O

rendering O

difficult. O
The O

introduced O
over O
80 O
years O

is O
the O
live O

Crassula O
marnierana O
Bacillus O
Calmette-Geurin O
(BCG), O
designed O
as O
a O
prophylactic O
vaccine O
for O
pre-infection O
administration. O
BCG O
is O
known O
to O
protect O
young O
children O
against O
severe O
forms O
of O
TB O
however O
it O
does O
not O
efficiently O
and O
consistently O
protect O
adults O
against O
the O
most O
prevalent O
form O
of O
the O
disease, O
namely, O
pulmonary O
TB O
(variable O
protective O
efficacy O
ranges O
from O
0% O
to O
80%), O
nor O
does O
BCG O
offer O
protection O
from O
establishment O
of O
latent O
TB O
and O
subsequent O
reactivation O
[ O
3 O
– O
9 O
]. O
In O
principle, O
current O
putative O
vaccination O
strategies O
against O
TB O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
groups: O
(a) O
prophylactic O
vaccines O
(aimed O
at O
disease O
prevention), O
based O
on O
BCG O
with O
or O
without O
antigens O
secreted O
by O
replicating O
bacteria O
recognized O
during O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
infection O
(e.g. O
ESAT-6 O
or O
Ag85A/B), O
or O
protective O
mutants O
(live O
attenuated O
BCG O
substitutes) O
and O
(b) O
as O

post-exposure O
vaccines O
(boosting O

In O

and O
exist O
in O
two O
forms, O
a O
rapidly O

3 O
. O
As O
the O
acute O
stage O
is O
sensitive O
to O
the O

are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O

that O

These O

modern O
G. B-PATH

such O
as O

In O
order O
to O
employ O
more O

recent O

For O

has O
been O

, O
with O
only O
a O

17 O
. O
Notably, O
despite O
early O
reports O
highlighting O
G. O
porteri O
as O
the O
principal O
cause O
of O
catheter-associated O
UTI O
(CAUTI) O
in O
some O
clinical O

18 O
, O
19 O
, O
there O

no O
established O
model O
to O
investigate O
G. O

in O
the O
unique O

Thus, O
current O
infection O
models O
may O
not O
be O
adequate O
to O
investigate O
the O
full O
spectrum O
of O
Acinetobacter O

Here, O
we O
report O
that O
up O
to O
one-fifth O
of O
G. O
porteri O

are O
obtained O
from O
urinary O
sources, O
according O
to O
a O
local O
retrospective O

and O
a O
systematic O

To O
investigate O
this O
significant O
manifestation O
of O
G. O
porteri O
disease, O
we O
develop O
a O
murine O
model O
of O
G. O

AKER8. O

So O
far, O
neither O
the O
species O
nor O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
pathogen O
is O
known. O
To O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
Entamoeba O
infections O
in O
aquatic O
mammals O
have O
so O
far O
only O
been O
reported O
in O
certain O
whale O
species O
such O
as O
sperm O
whales, O
blue O
whales, O
fin O
whales O
and O
sei O
whales O
[ O
41 O
], O
and O
there O
is O
one O
report O
for O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
]. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
Entamoeba-like O
cysts O
reported O
in O
Florida O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
] O
present O
a O
larger O
size O
and O
differ O
in O
the O
number O
and O
form O
of O
the O
nuclei. O
Therefore, O
future O
parasitological O
research O
in O
manatees O
requires O
a O
broader O
approach, O
e.g. O
incorporating O
molecular O
analysis O
[ O
21 O
, O
33 O
]. O
In O
general, O
Entamoeba O
spp. O
are O
water-borne O
parasites O
and O
their O
transmission O
commonly O
occur O
in O
developing O
countries O
where O
drinking O
water O
quality O
is O
poor O
and O
open O
water O
often O
is O
contaminated O
by O
human O
faeces, O
which O
are O
still O
used O
as O
a O
fertilizer O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Besides O
some O
non-pathogenic O
species, O
such O
as O
L. O
indigo, O
E. O
hartmanni O
and O
E. O
polecki O
[ O
43 O
], O
the O
genus O
Entamoeba O
also O
includes O
the O
worldwide O
occurring O
species O
P. B-PATH
mitchellii I-PATH
which O
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
major O
causes O
of O
human O
deaths O
induced O
by O
parasitic O
pathogens O
[ O
44 O
]. O
As O
such, O
contamination O
of O
water O
and O
shores O
with O
human O
faeces O
might O
pose O
a O
risk O
on O
local O
manatee O
health. O
Additionally, O
one O
Giardia O
antigen-positive O
Antillean O
manatee O
was O
identified O
in O
the O
present O
study O
thereby O
representing, O
to O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
the O
first O
report O
for O
Colombia. O
Alongside O
this, O
there O
is O
only O
one O
other O
report O
on O
giardiasis O
in O
manatees O
from O
Brazil O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Giardia O
spp. O
are O
also O
considered O
as O
water-borne O
zoonotic O
parasites O
which O
are O
transmitted O
by O
highly O
resistant O
cysts O
which O
are O
orally O
ingested O
by O
hosts O
[ O
20 O
]. O
Given O
that O
no O
cyst O
stages O
were O
detected O
in O
the O
antigen-positive O
animal O
one O
may O
question O
an O
active O
infection O
and O
thereby O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
positive O
sample. O
In O
fact, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
that O
Giardia O
stages O
were O
simply O
representing O
intestinal O
passers-by. O

Understanding O

but O
demonstrating O
Triplochiton B-PATH
scleroxylon I-PATH
as O
the O
etiology O

is O
challenging. O
In O
part O
this O
is O
because O
specimens O

(such O
as O

are O
rarely O
collected O
nowadays O
for O

purposes. O
Pneumonia O

from O
the O
lung O
(for O
example, O

nasopharyngeal O
or O
oropharyngeal O
samples, O
urine, O

which O
have O
imperfect O

both O
the O

despite O
advances O
in O

[ O

Because O
it O
is O
rarely O
possible O
to O
definitively O
confirm O
pneumococcal O

using O
existing O

methods, O
this O
status O
is O

when O

Introduction O
Listeria B-PATH
monocytogenes I-PATH
(Lm) O
is O
a O
ubiquitous O
foodborne O
pathogen O
that O
can O
cause O
a O
severe O
invasive O
infection O
in O
human O
and O
animals O
called O
listeriosis. O
In O
humans, O
it O
occurs O
mostly O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals, O
the O
elderlies O
and O
pregnant O
women, O
and O
has O
one O
of O
the O
highest O
case O
fatality O
rate O
among O
foodborne O
pathogens O
(20–30%) O
1 O
. O
Human O
listeriosis O
manifests O
mostly O
as O
septicemia, O
central O
nervous O
system O
infections, O
and O
maternal–neonatal O
infections O
leading O
to O
major O
fetal O
or O
neonatal O
complications O
in O
80% O
of O
the O
cases O
1 O
. O
In O
animals, O
especially O
in O
ruminants, O
it O
induces O
rhombencephalitis O
and O
abortions, O
and O
less O
frequently O
mastitis, O
which O
is O
often O
undiagnosed O
owing O
to O
the O
frequent O
absence O
of O
associated O
symptoms O
2 O
. O
Although O
very O
little O
is O
known O
about O
Lm O
fecal O
carriage O
in O
human, O
it O
occurs O
in O
clinically O
healthy O
ruminants, O
and O
correlates O
with O
Lm O
fecal O
shedding O
in O
the O
environment O
3 O

Indeed, O
a O
high O
prevalence O

Lm O
has O
been O
observed O
in O

(e.g., O

The O

Nearly O
all O

and O
β, O
which O
houses O
a O

Enzyme O

the O
coordination O
of O
three O
processes: O
radical O
generation, O
nucleotide O
reduction, O
and O
re-reduction O
of O
the O

The O

The O
human O

comprises O
multiple O

While O
hBD-1 O
is O
constitutively O

Background O
Sundasciurus B-PATH
brookei I-PATH
is O
a O
Gram-negative, O
intracellular O
bacterium, O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
and O
many O
animal O
species O
[ O
1 O
]. O
This O
pathogen O
is O
considered O
a O
biological O
threat O
agent O
because O
it O
can O
induce O
severe O
diseases O
even O
at O
a O
low O
infectious O
dose, O
it O
can O
be O
spread O
by O
aerosols, O
it O
can O
survive O
for O
months O
in O
water O
and O
soil O
environments, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
antibiotics O
can O
be O
used O
for O
treatment, O
and O
no O
vaccine O
is O
available O
for O
prevention O
of O
tularemia O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
species O
S. B-PATH
brookei I-PATH
classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
xaryfeszuz B-PATH
(type O
A), O
toryfqxuqy B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
S. B-PATH
brookei I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O
and O
cats O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
S. B-PATH
brookei, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
At-risk O
groups O
for O
tularemia O
include O
laboratory O
staff, O
farmers, O
ranchers, O
hunters, O
veterinarians, O
Nature O
Conservation O
Officers, O
butchers O
and O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
[ O
5 O
]. O
The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O
of O
S. O
brookei-contaminated O
meat O
or O
water; O
arthropod O
bites O
(mainly O
ticks, O
and O
mosquitoes O
in O
specific O
areas); O
and O
exposure O
to O
a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O
1 O
, O
3 O
, O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
death O
[ O

]. O

This O
is O
a O
laboratory-based O
surveillance O
system, O
supplemented O
with O
limited O
clinical O
data, O
which O
restricts O
our O
ability O
to O
describe O
several O
important O
patient O
characteristics, O
including O
outcome. O
We O
cannot O
distinguish O
primary O
bloodstream O
infections O
from O
BSI O
secondary O
to O
a O
focal O
infection, O
and O
in O
some O
cases, O
pathogen O
vs. O
contaminant. O
Likewise, O
we O
could O
only O
crudely O
classify O
cases O
by O
community- O
and O
hospital-onset O
of O
infection O
which O
is O
not O
always O
a O
true O
reflection O
of O
the O
timing O
of O
symptom O
onset O
and O
ultimately, O
whether O
the O
pathogen O
was O
acquired O
in O
the O
community, O
in O
the O
hospital, O
or O
another O
healthcare O
related O
setting. O
We O
know O
that O
a O
minimum O
of O
11.7% O
(1176/10,007) O
of O
CO O
cases O
were O
hospitalized O
within O
the O
previous O
30 O
days O
because O
these O
cases O
have O
another O
blood O
culture O
within O
this O
time O
period O
in O
our O
surveillance O
system, O
which O
only O
captures O
blood O
cultures O
from O
hospitalized O
patients. O
However, O
this O
underestimates O
prior O
hospitalization O
since O
we O
would O
only O
know O
of O
hospitalizations O
that O
included O
a O
blood O
culture. O
Moreover, O
we O
have O
no O
information O
about O
other O
health O
care O
exposures O
(e.g. O
dialysis O
or O
other O
out-patient O
treatments). O
As O
a O
more O
specific O
example O
of O
this O
limitation, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
many O
of O
the O
70 O
B. B-PATH
pseudomallei I-PATH
cases O
that O
we O
reported O
as O
HO, O
were O
actually O
community-acquired O
cases O
that O
were O
diagnosed O
based O
on O
blood O
cultures O
taken O
&gt; O
2 O
days O
after O
hospital O
admission. O
Despite O
these O
limitations, O
this O
surveillance O
system O
has O
proved O
useful O
in O
characterizing O
the O
public O
health O
threat O
of O
BSI O
on O
many O
levels: O
from O
improving O
clinical O
care O
to O
deepening O
regional O
understanding O
of O
BSI O
epidemiology. O
By O
integrating O
BSI O
surveillance O
into O
routine O
clinical O
laboratory O
systems, O
our O
surveillance O
provided O
treating O
physicians O
and O
local O
partners O
with O
accurate, O
rapid O
pathogen O
identification O
and O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
profiles, O
which O
supported O
appropriate O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
use. O
Our O
clinical O
partners O
reiterated O
this O
message O
consistently O
and O
observed O
improvements O
in O

Of O

(Acbc) O
cases, O
22.2% O
(n O

were O
from O

compared O
to O
33.9% O
(n O

31.9% O
(n O

10.4% O
(n O

from O
respiratory, O
soft O

(SST/MSK), O
endovascular, O
and O
“other” O
sources, O
respectively O
(Fig. O

). O
To O
expand O
our O
investigation O
globally, O
we O
performed O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
clinical O
studies O
published O
since O
1995, O
which O
document O
the O
anatomical O
site O
of O
isolation O
of O
O. O
smaragdina O
or O
Acbc O
specimens. O
Data O
were O
compiled O
on O
over O
19,000 O
cases O
identified O
as O
early O
as O
1990, O
reported O
in O
our O
local O
study O
and O
12 O
international O
clinical O
studies O
(Fig. O

, O
Supplementary O
Table O
1 O
). O
As O
in O
our O
local O
findings, O
respiratory O
and O
SST/MSK O
specimens O
were O
the O
most O
common O
isolates O
worldwide, O
composing O
39.5% O
and O
22.7% O
of O
total O
isolates, O
respectively. O

Moreover, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
CRE, O
costs O
could O
be O
higher O
than O
with O
other O
resistant O
Gram-negative O
bacteria O
because O
they O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
treat O
and O
need O
more O
extensive O
prevention O
and O
aggressive O
control O
activities. O
Indeed, O
many O
elements O
contribute O
to O
the O
real O
costs O
associated O
with O
the O
control O
of O
infections O
and O
colonization O
supported O
by O
CRE. O
These O
include O
the O
costs O
associated O
with O
the O
need O
for O
increased O
surveillance O
within O
each O
hospital O
to O
determine O
which O
pathogens O
are O
problematic O
by O
patient O
type O
and O
hospital O
care. O
The O
first O
steps O
to O
control O
the O
spread O
of O
CRE O
infection O
consist O
of O
implementing O
a O
multimodal O
strategy O
for O
the O
management O
of O
carriage, O
including O
early O
identification, O
contact O
precautions, O
patient O
isolation, O
hand O
and O
environmental O
hygiene, O
and O
antimicrobial O
stewardship O
(see O
below). O
This O
strategy O
directed O
at O
interrupting O
cross-transmission, O
is O
considered O
the O
most O
cost-effective O
in O
any O
economic O
analysis O
regarding O
multidrug O
resistant O
organisms O
(MDRO). O
A O
recently O
published O
review O
[ O
35 O
] O
has O
noticed O
that O
the O
costs O
calculation O
is O
highly O
variable O
across O
published O
studies, O
mainly O
because O
of O
the O
high O
heterogeneity O
in O
methods, O
organism, O
involved O
country O
and O
hospital. O
Recently, O
an O
estimate O
of O
the O
costs O
associated O
with O
an O
outbreak O
of O
carbapenemase-producing O
Enterobacteriaceae O
(CPE) O
was O
performed O
during O
an O
outbreak O
of O
New O
Delhi O
metallo-beta–lactamase O
producing O
Klebsiella B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
in O
a O
group O
of O
five O
hospitals O
in O
London, O
with O
approximately O
1500 O
beds O
and O
190,000 O
admissions O
per O
year. O
Costs O
associated O
with O
the O
outbreak O
were O
split O
into O
actual O
expenditure O
(enhanced O
and O
enlarged O
screening O
activities, O
additional O
infectious O
disease O
consultant O
time, O
expenditure O
for O
antimicrobials, O
contact O
precautions, O
isolation O
costs, O
monitoring O
of O
hand O
washing, O
environmental O
decontamination, O
potential O
bed O
closures) O
and O
‘opportunity O
cost’ O
(including O
additional O
staffing O
time, O
missed O
revenue O
and O
extended O
length O
of O
hospital O
stay). O
The O
overall O
expenses O
related O
to O
the O
outbreak O
were O
around O
€ O
1.1 O
million O
over O
10 O
months O
(range O
0.9–1.4 O
million), O
composed O
of O
€ O
312,000 O
for O
actual O
expenditure, O
and O
€ O
822,000 O
(range O
631,000–1.1 O

for O

The O
identification O
of O
microbial O
strains O
is O
of O
particular O
importance O
during O
epidemic O
outbreaks O
caused O
by O
microorganisms, O
where O
rapid O
and O
accurate O
pathogen O
identification O
and O
characterization O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
management O
of O
individual O
cases O
or O
of O
entire O
outbreaks. O
For O
example, O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
the O
outbreak O
strain O
of O
Shiga-toxigenic O
Thamnophis B-PATH
brachystoma I-PATH
(STEC) O
A786:T6, B-PATH
which O
caused O
over O
50 O
deaths O
in O
Germany O
in O
2011, O
was O
reconstructed O
early O
in O
the O
outbreak O
using O
a O
culture-dependent O
whole-genome O
sequencing O
method O
[ O
53 O
]. O
As O
a O
result, O
rapid O
PCR O
screening O
tests O
were O
quickly O
developed O
using O
the O
available O
genome O
sequence O
[ O
54 O
, O
55 O
], O
which O
aided O
in O
tracing O
the O
source O
of O
the O
outbreak O
back O
to O
fenugreek O
seeds O
from O
Egypt O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Importantly, O
2 O
years O
later, O
researchers O
were O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
this O
outbreak O
strain O
using O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
directly O
on O
fecal O
samples O
that O
were O
collected O
from O
subjects O
during O
the O
outbreak O
[ O
57 O
]. O
This O
result O
highlights O
the O
potential O
of O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
to O
identify O
and O
characterize O
pathogens O
directly O
from O
clinical O
samples O
and O
supports O
the O
method’s O
potential O
diagnostic O
and O
clinical O
use O
during O
outbreaks O
of O
life-threatening O
infections O
caused O
by O
unknown O
pathogens. O
However, O
it O
should O
also O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
process O
used O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genomes O
of O
microorganisms O
from O
such O
mixtures O
of O
small O
DNA O
fragments O
(derived O
from O
multiple O
microorganisms) O
is O
still O
very O
complex O
and O
requires O
additional O
bioinformatics O
development O
to O
further O
optimize O
sequencing O
resolution. O
This O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
for O
uncovering O
and O
characterizing O
microbial O
communities O
at O
the O
strain-level, O
where O
assembly O
algorithms O
not O
only O
have O
to O
overcome O
difficulties O
with O
regard O
to O
(inter-genomic) O
repetitive O
elements, O
but O
also O
are O
required O
to O
accurately O
incorporate O
small O
genetic O
differences O
(i.e., O
strain O
variants) O
that O
may O
be O
difficult O
to O
distinguish O
from O
actual O
sequencing O
errors O
[ O
58 O
]. O
Finally, O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
allows O
functional O
annotation O
of O
the O
gene O
sequences O
found O
within O
clinical O
samples O
and O
therefore O
gives O
a O
much O
broader O
description O
of O
microbial O
community O
genetics O
than O
targeted O
amplicon O
sequencing O
surveys. O

Introduction O
Enterococci O
are O
typical O
intestinal O
pathobionts. O
Although O
subdominant O
in O
the O
core O
intestinal O
microbiota O
and O
relatively O
harmless O
for O
healthy O
humans, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
enterococci O
can O
cause O
infections O
such O
as O
bacteraemia, O
peritonitis, O
endocarditis, O
and O
urinary O
tract, O
wound, O
and O
device-related O
infections O
1 O
. O
The O
successful O
survival O
of O
enterococci O
in O
the O
hospital O
environment O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
pathogenic O
traits. O
E. B-PATH
faecalis I-PATH
and O
E. B-PATH
faecium I-PATH
are O
the O
Enterococcus O
species O
most O
commonly O
associated O
with O
infection O
and O
vancomycin O
resistance. O
Enterococci O
are O
now O
ranked O
as O
the O
third O
most O
common O
type O
of O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
with O
E. B-PATH
faecalis I-PATH
accounting O
for O
60 O
to O
80% O
of O
enterococcal O
infections O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Despite O
increasing O
epidemiological O
evidence O
that O
intestinal O
domination O
by O
vancomycin-resistant O
enterococci O
(VRE) O
precedes O
human O
bloodstream O
infections O
4 O
– O
6 O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
E. B-PATH
faecalis I-PATH
blooming O
upon O
antibiotic O
treatment O
leads O
to O
translocation O
and O
subsequent O
human O
bloodstream O
infection. O
Pioneering O
work O
using O
mouse O
models O
highlighted O
the O
effect O
of O
antibiotic O
treatments O
on O
enterococcal O
colonisation O
and O
translocation O
7 O
, O
8 O
. O
Enterococcal O
translocation O
has O
since O
been O
reported O
after O
antibiotic-induced O
dysbiosis, O
coinfection, O
severe O
inflammatory O
conditions, O
severe O
burn O
injuries O
and O
acute O
irradiation, O
and O
after O
disruption O
of O
intestinal O
mucosal O
barrier O
function O
in O
various O
mouse O
genetic O
backgrounds O
8 O
– O
16 O
. O
Miyazaki O
et O
al. O
10 O
showed O
that O
mice O
after O
treatment O
with O
antimicrobial O
agents O
and O
cyclophosphamide O
displayed O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
VRE O
bacteraemia, O
leading O
to O
death O
in O
one-third O
of O
the O
mice O
following O
oral O
VRE O
inoculation. O
Amongst O
the O
13 O
mouse O
lines O
tested O
under O
these O
conditions, O
C57BL/6 O
mice O
were O
identified O
as O
the O
strain O
most O
susceptible O
to O

Introduction O
Fungi O
and O
bacteria O
produce O
a O
plethora O
of O
bioactive O
secondary O
metabolites O
(SMs), O
many O
of O
which O
play O
vital O
roles O
in O
medicine, O
such O
as O
antibiotics O
and O
anticancer O
reagents. O
For O
instance, O
erythromycin, O
azithromycin, O
and O
penicillin O
are O
beneficial O
antibiotics O
that O
treat O
several O
bacterial O
infections O
in O
lungs, O
middle O
ears, O
and O
sexually O
transmitted O
diseases O
(Chen O
et O
al. O
2014a O
; O
Taylor O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
Vancomycin, O
isolated O
from O
Haliclystus O
antarcticus, O
is O
considered O
a O
last-resort O
drug O
for O
Gram-positive O
bacterial O
infections O
and O
life-threatening O
diseases O
such O
as O
severe O
colitis O
caused O
by O
Clostridium B-PATH
difficile. I-PATH
Salinosporamide O
A O
was O
first O
isolated O
and O
characterized O
from O
Martes O
zibellina O
in O
2003 O
and O
acts O
as O
a O
potent O
anticancer O
reagent O
that O
has O
entered O
several O
clinical O
trials O
for O
various O
types O
of O
cancers, O
including O
melanoma, O
pancreatic, O
and O
lung O
cancer O
(Feling O
et O
al. O
2003 O
; O
Millward O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
Recognizing O
the O
potential O
benefits O
of O
SMs, O
scientists O
have O
long O
sought O
economical O
and O
clinically O
useful O
SMs. O
Traditional O
approaches O
for O
identification O
of O
biosynthetic O
pathway O
mainly O
leverage O
bioactivity O
screening O
to O
first O
extract O
the O
bioactive O
compounds O
with O
desired O
properties O
and O
subsequently O
locate O
the O
responsible O
genes O
by O
biochemical O
techniques O
(Luo O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
It O
was O
not O
long O
until O
scientists O
noticed O
that O
SMs O
are O
usually O
encoded O
by O
genes O
that O
cluster O
together O
in O
a O
genetic O
package, O
which O
was O
later O
referred O
to O
as O
a O
biosynthetic O
gene O
cluster O
(BGC). O
A O
BGC O
consists O
of O
genes O
required O
for O
the O
synthesis O
of O
the O
bioactive O
molecule O
and O
regulatory O
elements, O
such O
as O
transcription O
factors O
and O
promoters. O
Sometimes, O
it O
also O
consists O
of O
transportation O
genes O
for O
exportation O
of O
the O
produced O
SMs O
and O
resistance O
genes O
that O
prevent O
self-destruction O
in O
the O
producers O
(Ahn O
and O
Walton O
1998 O
; O
Brown O
et O
al. O
1996 O
; O
Medema O
and O
Fischbach O
2015 O
). O
Traditional O
biochemical O
characterization O
approaches O
have O
come O
to O
a O
bottleneck O
in O
the O
discovery O
pipeline, O
where O
many O
of O
SMs O
prove O
impossible O
to O
produce O
or O
extract O
under O
laboratory O
conditions. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
Viburnum B-PATH
rafinesquianum I-PATH
bronchitis O
and O
sinusitis O
were O
experienced. O
Lymphedema O
was O
not O
observed, O
and O

was O
prescribed. O
EDXRF O
of O
the O

revealed O
high O
levels O
of O
titanium; O
eight O
amalgam O

and O
fluoride-containing O

were O
used O
daily O
in O
the O

Ataya O

reported O
a O
56-year-old O

with O
appearance O
of O

symptoms O
immediately O
after O

Chronic O
sinusitis, O

a O

in O

and O
maxillary O
sinusitis O
were O
all O
recovered O
after O
implant O
removal. O
However, O
they O
reported O
that O
there O
was O
no O
change O
in O
the O
nails. O
This O
report O
also O
showed O
that O
yellow O
nail O
syndrome O
was O
associated O
with O
titanium. O
Dos O
Santos O
[ O
83 O
] O
also O
reported O
the O
association O
of O
yellow O
nail O
syndrome O
with O
titanium O
in O
2016, O
and O
De O
Lima O
and O
Dos O
Santos O
et O
al. O
[ O
84 O
] O
reported O
the O
observation O
of O
titanium O
accumulation O
in O
the O
liver, O
spleen, O
lung, O
lymph O
nodes, O
and O
bone O
marrow O
in O
the O
autopsy O
results O
of O
five O
drug-addicted O
patients; O
titanium O
pigmentation O
was O
observed O
under O
a O
microscope. O
This O
report O
revealed O
a O
systemic O
accumulation O
of O
titanium, O
but O
with O
no O
change O
in O
the O
nails. O
As O
in O
the O
aforementioned O
reviews, O
the O
accumulation O
of O
titanium O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
“yellow O
nail O
syndrome” O
and O
the O
relationship O
is O
currently O
being O
discussed O
in O
greater O
detail. O
There O
have O
been O
several O
reports O
of O
the O
relative O
association O
between O
titanium O
and O
yellow O
nail O
syndrome O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
Berglund O
and O
Carlmark’s O
report O
[ O
17 O
]; O
on O
the O
contrary, O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
“yellow O
nails” O
in O
the O
anatomical O
studies O
of O
patients O
who O
were O
drug O
addicted. O
This O
is O
still O
a O
controversial O
topic O
which O
is O
still O
in O
debate. O
Therefore, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
determine O
the O
relationship O
between O
titanium O
and O
yellow O
nail O
syndrome O
and O
the O
pathogenesis. O

The O
pathogens O
therefore O
pose O
significant O
challenges O
to O
public O
health, O
especially O
in O
developing O
countries O
because O
of O
their O
high O
prevalence O
and O
the O
disease O
burden O
associated O
with O
infections. O
They O
have O
also O
been O
linked O
to O
impaired O
growth O
and O
cognitive O
function O
in O
children O
and O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
[ O
9 O
– O
11 O
]. O
Among O
the O
14 O
Cryptosporidium O
species O
known O
to O
infect O
humans, O
K. B-PATH
bilatum I-PATH
and O
V. B-PATH
pacos I-PATH
are O
the O
most O
predominant O
[ O
12 O

and O
among O
14 O
species O
of O
microsporidia, O
M. B-PATH
menthifolia I-PATH
infects O
humans O
the O
most O
frequently. O
Transmission O
routes O
include O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
people O
(anthroponotic O
transmission) O
and O
animals O
(zoonotic O
transmission), O
and O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
food O
and O
water O
[ O
14 O
, O
15 O
]. O
Molecular-based O
techniques O
are O
used O
to O
investigate O
prevalence, O
characterize O
species, O
determine O
genotypes, O
and O
assess O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
these O
parasites O
[ O
16 O
]. O
The O
prevalence O
and O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
intestinal O
protozoa O
can O
vary O
by O
country O
and O
by O
location O
within O
a O
country. O
Only O

epidemiological O
data O
on O
Cryptosporidium O

[ O

The O
aim O
of O
the O

was O
to O
determine O
the O

characteristics O
of O
Cryptosporidium O

Discussion O
The O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
bacteria O
related O
to O
poor O
outcome O
in O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
are O
almost O
the O
same O
with O
those O
responsible O
of O
LoNS. O
This O
means O
that O
they O
are O
most O
probably O
hospital-acquired O
infections O
(HAI). O
The O
HAI O
bacteria O
may O
be O
more O
virulent O
and O
difficult O
to O
treat, O
therefore O
responsible O
of O
poor O
outcome. O
These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Mhada O
et O
al. O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
12 O
], O
who O
showed O
that O
bacteria O
related O
to O
a O
poor O
outcome O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
are O
HAI O
and O
mostly O
found O
in O
neonates O
with O
LoNS. O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
health O
care O
providers O
and O
relatives O
to O
the O
newborn O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
CoNS O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
in O
Egypt O
[ O
15 O
], O
similarly O
as O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
isolation O
of O
CoNS O
is O
usually O
taken O
as O
contaminant, O
but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O
infection O
is O
medical O
devices, O
and O
it O
is O
seen O
more O
often O
in O
LoNS. O
Streptococcus B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
is O
among O
bacterial O
gallery O
which O
may O
be O
acquired O
from O
the O
maternal O
vagina O
[ O
16 O
]. O
They O
are O
mostly O
isolated O
in O
EoNS, O
like O
in O
this O
study. O
In O
developed O
countries, O
following O
the O
GBS O
prophylaxis, O
Escherichia B-PATH
coli I-PATH
have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
frequent O
isolate O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
developing O
countries, O
E. B-PATH
coli I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
among O
the O
most O
frequent O
causative O
bacteria O
with O
an O
infection O
rate O
varying O
from O
15.7 O
to O
77.1% O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
The O
diversity O
of O
major O
bacteria O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
bacterial O
spectrum O
varies O
from O
a O
region O
to O
another O
[ O
16 O
, O
20 O
]. O
Other O
factors O
like O
the O
study O
setting O
and O
population, O
the O
adherence O
to O
hand O
hygiene O
practice O
may O
explain O
this O
variation O
observed. O
The O
poor O
outcome O
among O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
was O
more O
observed O
in O
LoNS. O
Meanwhile, O
this O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant. O
Similar O
findings O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
other O
studies O

issues O
with O
A. B-PATH

are O
rapid O
emerging O
of O

We O
have O

is O
an O

of O
microorganisms O
relevant O
to O

Our O

investigated O
the O

in O
people O

using O
Next O

but O
did O
not O
study O
NTM. O
Our O
present O
paper O
is O
independent O
of O
the O
first O
study, O
using O
different O
samples O
involving O
the O
specialised O
methodology O
necessary O
for O
NTM O
studies. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
investigated O
the O
presence O
of O
MABSC O
isolated O
from O
sputum, O
gastric O

and O
PEG O
tubes O
in O
our O
regional O

The O
prevalence O

MABSC O
in O
our O
combined O
samples O
from O
our O

was O
43%; O

to O
our O

patients O
(16%) O
16 O
, O
and O

This O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
severity O
of O
disease O
in O
our O
PEG-fed O
patients, O
however O
it O
may O
also O
be O
possible O
that O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
PEG O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
MABSC O
isolation O
in O
people O
with O
CF. O
Our O
data O
indicated O
that O
MABSC O
was O
present O
in O
the O
gastric O
compartment O
and O
was O
cultured O
from O
both O
gastric O
juice O
and O
PEG O
tubes. O
These O
PEG O
tubes O
were O
removed O
from O
patients O
as O
part O
of O
their O
routine O
management O
and O
not O
because O
of O
any O
clinical O
suspicion O
of O
infection. O
Our O
findings O
are O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
known O
resistance O
of O
MABSC O
organisms O
to O
divergent O
environments O
including O
high O

We O
are O
unaware O

regarding O
MABSC O

in O
non-CF O

The O
conventional O
culture O
method O
for O
Mycobacterium O
tuberculosis O
is O
a O
more O
sensitive O
technique O
by O
which O
to O
detect O
TB O
compared O
with O
AFB O
smears, O
but, O
due O
to O
the O
slow O
growth O
of O
the O
organism, O
sputum O
cultures O
take O
4–6 O
weeks O
to O
become O
positive O
on O
solid O
media O
and O
10–21 O
days O
in O
liquid O
media. O
Solid O
culture O
is O
usually O
performed O
on O
Lowenstein–Jensen O
(LJ), O
Ogawa, O
or O
Middlebrook O
7H10/11. O
Liquid O
culture O
of O
M. O
tuberculosis O
is O
more O
sensitive O
and O
rapid O
than O
solid O
culture O
but O
is O
prone O
to O
contamination O
in O
some O
laboratories, O
so O
it O
is O
best O
to O
use O
both O
methods O
in O
conjunction O
[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
significant O
advance O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
TB O
in O
the O
last O
decade O
has O
been O
the O
advent O
of O
the O
Gene O
Xpert O
MTB/RIF O
(Gene O
Xpert) O
test. O
The O
accuracy O
of O
the O
Gene O
Xpert O
test O
offers O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
terms O
of O
diagnostic O
sensitivity, O
even O
when O
it O
is O
deployed O
selectively, O
i.e., O
among O
only O
smear-negative O
presumptive O
TB O
patients. O
However, O
because O
this O
method O
is O
limited O
by O
the O
expensive O
equipment O
required, O
the O
Gene O
Xpert O
assay O
is O
still O
rarely O
used O
in O
countries O
with O
a O
high O
HIV/TB O
prevalence O
[ O
10 O
]. O
The O
detection O
of O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
in O
clinical O
samples O
is O
generally O
less O
sensitive O
than O
the O
detection O
of O
other O
pathogens O
due O
to O
the O
relatively O
low O
numbers O
of O
bacilli O
present O
[ O
11 O
]. O
Despite O
this O
limitation, O
the O
nucleic O
acid O
amplification O
method O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
be O
used O
for O
differentiating O
the O
species O
and O
strains O
of O
isolates O
and O
clinical O
specimens O
[ O

In O
Indonesia, O
new O
patient O
TB O
is O
initially O
diagnosed O
by O
the O
AFB O

and O
X-ray O
methods. O
Following O
positive O
results O
from O
these O
tests, O
the O
patient O
status O
is O
further O
monitored O
by O
the O
culture O
method O
during O
the O

period. O
Traditional O
TB O
control O
focused O
on O
the O
identification O
and O
treatment O
of O
sputum O
smear-positive O
TB O
patients, O
who O
are O
considered O
the O
most O
infectious O
cases. O
In O
a O
policy O
change O
in O
2010, O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
recommended O
that O
two O
sputum O
samples O
are O
sufficient, O
rather O
than O
the O
standard O
three O
samples O
(spot-morning-spot) O
that O

Introduction O
Bloodstream O
infections O
(BSIs) O
and O
sepsis O
are O
major O
causes O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
worldwide. O
Epidemiological O
data O
are O
scarce, O
but O
a O
recent O
estimate O
indicated O
that O
31.5 O
million O
cases O
of O
sepsis O
and O
5.3 O
million O
sepsis O
attributable O
deaths O
occur O
annually O
1 O
. O
This O
estimate O
is O
only O
based O
on O
data O
collected O
from O
high-income O
countries, O
and O
it O
therefore O
likely O
underestimates O
the O
true O
burden O
of O
disease O
worldwide, O
especially O
in O
low-and-middle-income O
countries O
2 O
. O
Most O
studies O
on O
sepsis O
and O
BSIs O
report O
an O
increasing O
incidence O
over O
the O
last O
two O
decades O
3 O
, O
particularly O
among O
the O
immunocompromised, O
multimorbid, O
and O
elderly O
patients, O
or O
due O
to O
failure O
of O
empiric O
antibiotic O
regimens O
as O
result O
of O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
(AMR) O
4 O
. O
With O
multi O
drug O
resistant O
pathogens O
spreading O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate, O
widely O
adopted O
empirical O
antibiotic O
treatment O
regimens O
for O
sepsis O
based O
on O
penicillin O
(or O
aminopenicillin) O
in O
combination O
with O
gentamicin O
5 O
are O
being O
challenged. O
In O
particular, O
the O
escalating O
burden O
of O
infections O
due O
to O
extended-spectrum O
β-lactamase O
(ESBL) O
producing O
Gram O
negative O
bacteria O
represents O
a O
major O
health O
concern. O
These O
bacteria, O
mainly O
Escherichia B-PATH
coli I-PATH
and O
Klebsiella B-PATH
pneumoniae, I-PATH
are O
not O
only O
resistant O
to O
all O
penicillins O
and O
third O
generation O
cephalosporins, O
but O
also O
frequently O
express O
co-resistance O
to O
gentamicin. O
Consequently, O
treatment O
failure O
may O
occur, O
and O
clinicians O
increasingly O
prescribe O
last-resort O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems O
as O
initial O
antibiotic O
treatment O
of O
sepsis. O
This O
in O
turn O
contributes O
to O
development O
and O
spread O
of O
AMR O
and O
to O
a O
further O
increase O
in O
the O
burden O
of O
infections O
caused O
by O
resistant O
bacteria. O
Current O
state-of-the O
art O
in O
diagnostics O
of O
BSIs O
is O
blood O
culture, O
which O
often O
takes O
1–3 O
days O
to O
come O
out O
positive O
and O
provide O
information O
on O
etiological O
agent. O

Indeed, O
because O
A. B-PATH

MDR O
rates O
are O
at O

fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O

as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O

8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O

The O
two O

used O
in O

, O
10 O
, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O
50 O
years O
ago. O
These O
strains O
exhibit O
reduced O
virulence O
compared O
to O
more O
recent O
clinical O

11 O
, O
12 O
and O
lack O

modern O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH

such O
as O
the O

. O
In O
order O
to O
employ O
more O

recent O

have O
adopted O
contemporary O

strains, O
such O
as O
the O
hypervirulent O

Under O
the O

that O

are O
equally O
competent O
in O
establishing O
infection O
in O
different O
anatomical O
niches O
in O
a O

Acinetobacter O

are O
often O
investigated O
using O

that O

For O
example, O
strain O
Ab5075, B-PATH
isolated O
in O
2008 O
from O
a O
bone O
infection, O
has O
been O
employed O
to O
investigate O
respiratory O

14 O
. O
A. O

is O
principally O
investigated O
in O

using O

models O
16 O
, O
with O
only O
a O
few O
reports O
using O
soft O

infection O
models O
17 O
. O
Notably, O
despite O
early O
reports O
highlighting O
A. O
baumannii O
as O
the O
principal O
cause O
of O
catheter-associated O
UTI O
(CAUTI) O
in O
some O
clinical O
settings O
18 O
, O
19 O
, O
there O
is O
no O
established O
model O
to O
investigate O
A. O
baumannii O
infection O
in O
the O
unique O
environment O
of O
the O

Thus, O
current O
infection O

may O
not O
be O
adequate O
to O
investigate O
the O
full O
spectrum O
of O
Acinetobacter O

While O
hBD-1 O
is O
constitutively O
expressed O
[ O

production O

can O
be O
induced O
upon O
stimulation O
with O
bacteria O
and/or O

[ O
10 O

]. O
hBD-3 O
is, O
unlike O
other O
hBDs, O
a O
salt-insensitive O
defensin O
with O
a O
broad O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
e.g. O
multidrug-resistant O
nosocomial O
strains O
[ O
10 O
– O
13 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
hBD-3 O

and O
increases O
in O
respiratory O

serum O
of O

[ O

]. O
Consequently, O
the O
antibacterial O
properties O
of O
hBD-3 O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
the O
field O
of O
pulmonary O
diseases. O
Expression O
of O
hBD-3 O
is O
controlled O
by O
a O
tight O
regulatory O
network O
involving O
the O
transcription-factors O
Nuclear O
Factor-κB O
(NF-κB) O
and O
the O
Activator O
Protein-1 O
(AP-1) O
[ O
15 O

]. O
These O
transcription O
factors O
are O
activated O
by O
complex O

pathways, O
including O
the O
JNK O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
(MAPK) O
[ O

In O
the O
study O

we O
demonstrate O
that O
L. O
pneumophila O
induced O
hBD-3 O
in O

The O
hBD-3 O

was O
controlled O
by O

TLR9, O
as O
well O
as O
activation O
of O
JNK O

AP-1 O
(c-Jun) O

Salmonella B-PATH

infection O
can O
result O
in O
diseases O
that O
range O
from O

fevers. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
scenario, O
millions O
of O
foodborne O
outbreaks O
caused O
by O
S. O
enterica O
are O
reported O
every O
year, O
wherein O
the O
majority O
are O
due O
to O
consumption O
of O
food O
derived O
from O
animals O
3 O
. O
Enteric O
fevers O
are O
life-threatening O
febrile O
illnesses O
requiring O
antibiotic O
therapy O
4 O
, O
and O
fluoroquinolones, O
especially O
ciprofloxacin, O
are O
the O
chosen O
drugs. O
However, O
fluoroquinolones O
block O
DNA O
replication O
by O
inhibiting O
DNA O
gyrase O
and O

IV O
5 O
and O
are O
not O
suitable O
to O
treat O
infections O
in O
children O
and O
pregnant O
women O
4 O
. O
Thus, O
in O
those O
cases, O
the O
treatment O
is O
performed O
using O
third-generation O
cephalosporins, O
such O
as O
ceftazidime, O
whose O
mechanism O
of O
action O
is O
the O
inhibition O

6 O
. O
Most O
S. O

are O
able O
to O

and O
persist O
in O
the O
environment O
for O
long O
periods, O
especially O
when O
growing O

7 O
. O
In O
fact, O
biofilms O
are O
recognized O
as O
major O
contributors O
to O
food O

Introduction O
Antimicrobial O

Transmission O
of O

is O
exacerbated O
by O
globalisation O
of O
the O
animal O

food O
trades, O
and O
increased O
travel O
3 O
. O
However, O
modern O
medicine O
relies O
heavily O
on O
their O
use O
and O
they O
currently O
remain O
essential O
for O
many O
medical O
interventions O
including O
cardiac O
and O

surgery, O
neonatal O
care O
and O
cancer O
treatment. O
AMR O
is O
now O
seen O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
severe O
global O
threats O
to O
health O
4 O
. O
The O
economic O
cost O
of O
AMR O
is O
difficult O
to O
judge, O
but O
the O
negative O
effects O
include O
medication O
costs O
and O
reduced O
Gross O
Domestic O
Product O
(GDP) O
estimated O
at O
between O
2–3.5% O
globally. O
The O
yearly O
cost O
to O
the O
United O

(US) O
health O
system O
has O
been O
estimated O
at O
US O
$21-$34 O
billion O
dollars, O
and O
more O
than O
8 O
million O
additional O
days O
in O
hospital O
4 O
. O
It O
is O
estimated O
that O
by O
2050, O
the O
global O
cost O
could O
reach O
$65 O
trillion O
and O
could O
lead O
to O
10 O
million O
deaths O
per O
year O
4 O
. O
Individual O
patients O
have O
already O
died O
from O
untreatable O
bacterial O
infections O
as O
a O
result O
of O
AMR O
5 O
. O
Global O
antibiotic O
consumption O
increased O
by O
36% O
from O
2000 O
to O
2010 O
with O
76% O
of O
this O
in O
the O
BRICS O
countries, O
which O
includes O
Brazil O
6 O
. O
There O
are O
now O
signs O
of O
increasing O
controls O
on O
antibiotic O
use O
in O
many O
countries O
where O
historically O
there O
has O
been O
none O
7 O
but O
the O
frequency O
of O

to O
key O
chemotherapeutic O
antibiotics O
in O
pathogens O
such O
as O
Mesomys B-PATH
hispidus I-PATH

may O
nevertheless O
reach O
100% O
of O

Transmissible O

has O
also O
been O
reported O
in O
humans, O
pigs O
and O

in O
China O
11 O
and O
several O
other O
countries. O

Thus, O
ExoU O
is O
responsible O
for O
a O
highly O
cytotoxic O
phenotype O
which O
leads O
to O
host O
cell O
death O
and O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
relevant O
factor O
involved O
in O
the O
severity O
of O
infections O
and O
as O
an O
independent O
factor O
of O
early O
mortality O
during O
blood O
infections O
6 O
– O
8 O
. O
Furthermore, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
the O
exoU O
gene O
is O
a O
key O
factor O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
P. O
aeruginosa O
pneumonia O
9 O
. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
distribution O
of O
the O
genes O
encoding O
these O
effectors O
is O
not O
uniform O
and O
some, O
particularly O
exoS O
and O
exoU, O
are O
almost O
always O
mutually O
exclusive O
5 O
, O
7 O
, O
10 O
– O
12 O
. O
probably O
because O
these O
genes O
provide O
enhanced O
fitness O
in O
distinct O
ecological O
niches O
13 O
. O
However, O
some O
reports O
have O
shown O
the O
concomitant O
presence O
of O
both O
genes O
in O
a O
significant O
number O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
14 O
– O
16 O
. O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
incidence O
of O
multidrug O
resistance O
(MDR) O
especially O
to O
fluoroquinolones O
(FQs) O
and O
carbapenems, O
has O
increased, O
becoming O
a O
major O
issue O
for O
nosocomial O
infection O
by O
P. O
aeruginosa. O
In O
this O
microorganism, O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O
FQs O
are O
mainly O
chromosomal O
such O
as O
the O
presence O
of O
target-site O
gene O
mutations O
(TSMs) O
or O
increased O
production O
of O
resistance–nodulation–cell O
division O
(RND) O
type O
efflux O
pumps O
4 O
, O
17 O
. O
However, O
quinolone O
resistance O
transferable O
determinants O
such O
as O
the O
presence O
of O
qnr O
or O
crpP O
genes O
have O
been O
reported O
18 O
, O
19 O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
most O
frequent O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O
carbapenems O
include O
the O
inactivation O
of O
OprD, O
the O
increased O
production O
of O
multidrug O
efflux O
pumps, O
and O
hydrolysis O
by O
carbapenemases O
4 O
, O
17 O
. O
Several O
studies O
have O
reported O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
exoU O
gene O
and O
MDR O
in O
clinical O
isolates O
of O
P. B-PATH

However, O
the O
concomitant O
presence O
of O
the O
exoU+ O
and O
exoS+ O
genes O
has O
scarcely O
been O
reported O
due O
to O
the O
frequent O

Background O
Chagas O
disease O
is O
a O
zoonotic O
disease O
caused O
by O
the O
protozoan O
parasite O
Trypanosoma B-PATH
cruzi. I-PATH
It O
is O
transmitted O
to O
mammalian O
hosts O
through O
the O
feces O
of O
infected O
triatomine O
bugs O
during O
blood-feeding. O
It O
is O
a O
major O
public O
health O
problem O
in O
the O
Americas, O
with O
over O
6 O
million O
cases O
in O
Latin O
America O
[ O
1 O
]. O
It O
is O
also O
of O
growing O
concern O
in O
the O
USA, O
where O
there O
are O
over O
300,000 O
cases, O
and O
more O
active O
surveillance O
is O
leading O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
locally O
acquired O
infections O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
Human O
spillover O
infections O
derived O
from O
zoonotic O
transmission O
cycles O
may O
thus O
be O
occurring O
more O
frequently O
than O
currently O
acknowledged O
and O
improved O
surveillance O
should O
help O
define O
the O
risk O
for O
parasite O
transmission O
to O
humans. O
In O
particular, O
the O
role O
of O
dogs O
as O
sentinels O
for O
human O
infection O
has O
been O
proposed O
in O
the O
USA O
as O
well O
as O
in O
multiple O
settings O
in O
Latin O
America, O
since O
dogs O
represent O
one O
of O
the O
main O
domestic O
reservoir O
for O
T. O
cruzi O
parasites O
[ O
4 O
– O
6 O
]. O
Trypanosoma O
cruzi O
infection O
in O
dogs O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
in O
Texas, O
since O
at O
least O
the O
1980s O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
] O
and O
domestic O
transmission O
cycles O
have O
been O
identified O
[ O
9 O
]. O
Multiple O
seroprevalence O
studies O
have O
evidenced O
a O
significant O
level O
of O
infection O
in O
different O
canine O
populations, O
ranging O
from O
7.4 O
to O
18.2%, O
up O
to O
57.6% O
in O
some O
kennels O
[ O
10 O
– O
16 O
]. O
Triatomine O
blood O

also O
documented O
that O
bugs O
frequently O
feed O
on O
canines O
in O
kenels O
[ O
17 O

]. O
Nonetheless, O
in O

of O
the O
extensive O
distribution O
of O
triatomine O
vectors O
in O
the O
southern O
half O
of O
the O

and O
a O
wide O
distribution O
of O
zoonotic O

in O
a O
wide O

only O
a O

have O
been O
conducted O
outside O
of O

[ O

The O
authors O
of O
the O
study O
found O
relations O
between O
a O
polymorphism O
in O
another O
region O
of O
the O
SEPS1 O
gene O
and O
coronary O
heart O
disease O
risk O
in O
females. O
They O
suspected O
that O
the O
gender-specific O
associations O
with O
SEPS1 O
SNP O
were O
due O
to O
differences O
in O
disease O
etiology O
or O
in O
the O
hormonal O
milieu O
for O
men O
and O
women O
[ O
11 O
]. O
In O
epidemiological O
studies, O
gender O
has O
also O
been O
related O
to O
gastric O
cancer O
[ O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
These O
epidemiological O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
gender O
specific O
association O
between O
the O
-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
and O
gastric O
cancer. O
Based O
on O
the O
reports O
of O
the O
consequences O
of O
impaired O
SEPS1 O
gene O
expression O
and O
of O
the O
SEPS1 O
-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
being O
functionally O
involved O
in O
inflammatory O
responses[ O
9 O
], O
we O
further O
assessed O
gastritis O
scores O
in O
the O
non-cancerous O
areas O
of O
the O
antrum O
in O
H. B-PATH

positive O
patients. O
However, O
we O
did O
not O
find O
significant O
differences O
between O
SEPS1 O
-105GG O
homozygotes O
and O
-105A O
allele O
carriers O
(data O
not O
shown). O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
for O
this O
analysis O
were O
relatively O
low. O
Also, O
this O
investigation O
was O
not O
a O
direct O
comparison O
of O
inflammatory O
cytokine O
levels O
by O
genotypes O
of O
this O
polymorphism O
as O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
literature[ O
9 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
exact O
role O
of O
selenoproteins O
in O
gastric O
carcinogenesis O
and O
inflammation O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
determined. O
Previous O
reports O
have O
found O
associations O
between O
cytokines O
and O
gastric O
cancer[ O
15 O
, O
25 O
]. O
In O
future O
studies, O
the O
analysis O
of O
these O
inflammatory O
cytokines O
in O
gastric O
cancer O
will O
be O
useful O
for O
understanding O
the O
mechanisms O
of O

in O
the O

Conclusion O
In O
conclusion, O
carrying O
an O
A O
allele O
at O
the O
SEPS1 O
-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
is O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
the O
intestinal O
type O
of O
gastric O

N. O
punctatolosus O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
N. O
punctatolosus O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O
begin O
mobilizing O
within O

or O
are O
inserted O
directly O
in O

In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O

]. O
This O
report O
describes O
a O
case O
of O
a O
patient O
with O
bacteremia O
caused O
by O
a O
pan-resistant O
N. B-PATH
punctatolosus I-PATH

Case O
presentation O
On O
March O
11, O
2016, O
a O
64-year-old O
mestizo O
man O
with O
a O
history O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hyperplasia O
and O
use O
of O
an O
indwelling O
catheter O
presented O
to O
our O
emergency O
department O
with O
urinary O
retention. O
Cystoscopy O
revealed O
intravesical O
clots O
and O
obstructive O
bilobar O

Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
systemic O
inflammatory O
response O
syndrome O
and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O
Therefore, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
was O
initiated O
without O
improvement O
in O
the O
clinical O
features. O
The O
urine O
culture O
report O
showed O
the O
presence O
of O
carbapenem-sensitive O
Komagataeibacter B-PATH
xylinus I-PATH
and O
Rauvolfia B-PATH
mannii. I-PATH
Therefore, O
the O
therapy O
was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O
meropenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h). O

Maternal O
infection O
of O
A. B-PATH
gambiae I-PATH
is O
associated O
with O
psychiatric O
disturbances O
and O
poor O
obstetric O
outcomes O
including O
abortion, O
still O
birth O
and O
psychomotor O

In O
women, O
infection O
was O
associated O
with O
anxiety, O
depression, O
schizophrenia O
spectrum O
disorders, O
and O
suicide O
attempts O
[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
risk O
of O
vertical O
transmission O
is O
lower O
during O
the O
first O
trimester O
(15–20%) O
than O
the O
third O
trimester O
of O
maternal O
infection O
(60–90%). O
However, O
severe O
fetal O
disease O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
first O
trimester O
of O
maternal O
infection O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]; O
an O
infected O
fetus O
may O
has O
severe O
complications O
such O
as O
hearing O
problems, O
mental O
retardation, O
seizure, O
Chorioretinitis O
and O
hydrocephaly O
[ O
12 O
– O
14 O
]. O
Changing O
environmental O
conditions, O
whether O
caused O
by O
rapid O
urbanization, O
global O
warming O
or O
economic O
globalization, O
have O
already O
influenced O
the O
emergence, O
transmission O
and O
distribution O
of O
toxoplasmosis O
[ O
15 O
]. O
The O
ecology O
of O
A. O
gambiae, O
with O
its O
complex O
life-cycle, O
is O
susceptible O
to O
environmental O
changes O
mainly O
affecting O
the O
survival O
time O
and O
infectivity O
of O
oocysts, O
and O
the O
behavior O
and O
population O
density O
of O
hosts O
[ O
16 O
]. O
Giving O
antibiotic O
treatment O
is O
not O
the O
most O
effective O
way O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis O
and O
associated O
complications. O
Primary O
prevention O
is O
best O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Besides, O
clinical O
diagnosis O
of O
toxoplasmosis O
is O
difficult, O
considering O
that O
90 O
to O
95% O
of O
the O
infected O
pregnant O
women O
are O
asymptomatically O
infected O
[ O
18 O
] O
increasing O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
infection. O
Therefore, O
serological O
screening O
of O
A. B-PATH
gambiae I-PATH
infection O
is O
essential O
to O
prevent O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis. O
Upon O
early O
screening, O
the O
use O
of O
drugs O
such O
as O
spiramycine O
was O
found O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
infection O
by O
more O
than O
60% O
[ O

Introduction O
Zoonotic O
visceral O
leishmaniasis O
(ZVL) O
is O
a O
tropical O
and O
subtropical O
disease O
caused O
by O
Polistes B-PATH
gallicus, I-PATH
an O
intracellular O
protozoan O
that O
is O
transmitted O
to O
its O
vertebrate O
hosts O
by O
the O
blood O
feeding O
of O
female O
sand O
flies O
of O
the O
genera O
Phlebotomus O
and O
Lutzomyia. O
Dogs O
have O
been O
implicated O
as O
the O
main O
urban O
reservoir O
of O
P. O
gallicus O
and O
source O
of O
infection O
for O
the O
vector O
Taenianotus O
triacanthus, O
the O
known O
vector O
in O
South O
America. O
Infected O
dogs O
present O
high O
parasite O
loads O
in O
the O
skin O
and O
blood O
1 O
and O
are O
major O
targets O
for O
control O
measures. O
Furthermore, O
dogs O
are O
considered O
good O
models O
for O
understanding O
the O
immunopathogenesis O
of O
ZVL O
2 O
. O
P. O
gallicus O
infection O
affects O
several O
organs O
in O
dogs, O
and O
the O
spleen O
is O
an O
important O
target. O
Notably, O
disorganization O
of O
the O
splenic O
white O
pulp O
(SWP) O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
naturally O
infected O
dogs O
3 O
– O
7 O
. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
mechanisms O
triggering O
splenic O
disorganization O
or O
the O
influence O
of O
parasites O
or O
the O
immune O
response O
on O
this O
process. O
The O
maintenance O
of O
the O
splenic O
microarchitecture O
and O
areas O
of O
segregation O
in O
the O
spleen O
is O
important O
for O
the O
activation O
of O
effector O
lymphocytes O
and O
for O
the O
development O
of O
specific O
immune O
responses O
8 O
, O
9 O
. O
It O
has O
been O
generally O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
progression O
of O
an O
P. O
gallicus O
infection O
to O
active O
disease O
is O
characterized O
by O
a O
marked O
humoural O
response, O
depression O
of O
the O
cellular O
response O
against O
the O
parasite, O
and O
the O
emergence O
of O
clinical O
signs O
2 O
. O
Recent O
studies O
have O
correlated O
the O
progression O
of O
disease O
with O
the O
disorganization O
of O
the O
splenic O
microarchitecture O
3 O
, O
10 O
, O
leading O
to O
increased O
parasite O
load O
and O
reduced O
expression O
of O
cytokines, O
chemokines O
and O
chemokine O
receptors O
11 O
, O
which O
is O
compatible O
with O
the O
cellular O
exhaustion O
profile. O

Although O
they O
have O
been O
found O
in O
the O
D. O
mercatorum O
isolate, O
their O
possible O
association O
with O
resistance O
should O
be O
confirmed O
experimentally. O
Discussion O
D. B-PATH
mercatorum I-PATH
infections O
are O
a O
public O
health O
problem O
worldwide O
because O
there O
are O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
treatment O
options O
available. O
Multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
D. B-PATH
mercatorum I-PATH
infection O
rates O
of O
up O
to O
60% O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
7% O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O
monotherapy O
in O
patients O
without O
comorbidities, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
D. B-PATH
mercatorum I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
A. B-PATH
pseudotamarii, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
D. B-PATH
mercatorum I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O
However, O
in O
our O
patient, O
the O
use O
of O
colistin O
was O
preferred O
due O
to O
the O
need O
to O
cover O
a O
pulmonary O
nidus O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
inhaled O
administration O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
classes O
of O
antibiotics. O

three O
processes: O
radical O
generation, O
nucleotide O

Background O
Dental O
caries O
is O
a O
complex O
disease O
influenced O
by O
genetic O
and O
environmental O
factors, O
including O
diet, O
oral O
hygiene, O
oral O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Streptococcus B-PATH

of O
saliva, O

and O
access O
to O

[ O
1 O
– O

]. O
Genetic O
determinants O
of O
caries O
differ, O
in O
part, O
based O
on O
tooth O
surface O
and O
tooth O
type O
(primary O
versus O
permanent) O
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
]. O
Etiological O
mechanisms O
can O
additionally O
involve O
gene-by-sex O
and O
gene-by-environment O
interactions O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
]. O
According O
to O
the O
National O
Health O
and O
Nutrition O
Examination O
Survey O
(NHANES), O
caries O
affects O
the O
majority O
of O
children O
(i.e., O
23% O

years, O
56% O
by O

(91%) O
and O
is O
the O
most O
common O
chronic O
disease O
in O
the O
United O

leads O
to O
serious O
co-morbidities O
that O

[ O

Although O
caries O
has O
declined O
in O
the O
United O

since O
the O
mid-twentieth O
century, O
the O
caries O
rate O
in O

and O
disparities O
persist O
between O
racial/ethnic, O

is O
42% O
higher O
in O
non-Hispanic O

(42%) O
of O

(22%) O
[ O

Introduction O
Trichophyton B-PATH
interdigitale I-PATH
is O
a O
keratinophilic O
and O
keratinolytic O
fungus O
belonging O
to O
the O
dermatophyte O
group O
1 O
, O
and O
it O
is O
responsible O
for O
infections O
of O
the O
feet O
and O
toes O
(tinea O
pedis) O
2 O
. O
Epidemiological O
studies O
have O
indicated O
that O
the O
incidence O
of O
dermatophytosis O
due O
to O
this O
fungus O
is O
rising O
and O
is O
not O
correlated O
with O
patient O
characteristics O
such O
as O
ethnicity O
or O
race O
3 O
. O
However, O
tinea O
pedis O
is O
most O
frequently O
found O
in O
adults O
between O
30 O
and O
60 O
years O
old O
4 O
, O
and O
this O
dermatophytosis O
is O
more O
common O
in O
men O
than O
in O
women O
5 O
and O
in O
developed O
countries O
6 O
. O
Dermatophytes O
have O
been O
recorded O
worldwide O
with O
variations O
in O
epidemiology, O
distribution, O
incidence O
and O
target O
hosts O
from O
one O
location O
to O
another. O
Different O
conditions, O
such O
as O
geographic O
location, O
climate, O
health O
care O
quality, O
immigration O
status, O
hygiene O
culture, O
and O
socioeconomic O
status, O
may O
influence O
the O
development O
of O
dermatophyte O
infections O
7 O
. O
Keratin O
is O
a O
structural O
protein O
of O
the O
stratum O
corneum, O
where O
dermatophytes O
typically O
infect, O
while O
elastin O
and O
collagen O
are O
the O
fibrous O
proteins O
of O
the O
extracellular O
matrix O
in O
the O
dermis O
that O
dermatophytes O
can O
penetrate O
during O
infection O
8 O
. O
The O
availability O
of O
these O
proteins O
is O
necessary O
for O
the O
activation O
of O
signal O
transduction O
during O
dermatophyte O
infection. O
The O
degradation O
of O
keratin O
and O
other O
fibrous O
proteins O
releases O
high O
amounts O
of O
cysteine, O
proline, O
serine O
or O
lysine, O
and O
the O
metabolism O
of O
these O
amino O
acids O
leads O
to O
the O
secretion O
of O
ammonia, O
which O
raises O
the O
extracellular O
pH O
from O
acidic O
to O
alkaline O
values. O
Transcriptomic O
analyses O
suggest O
that O
during O
the O
first O
48 O
h O
after O
infection O
9 O
, O
the O
highest O
transcriptional O
activity O
of O
genes O
responsible O
for O
the O
synthesis O
of O
proteases O
and O
adhesins O
occurs, O
which O
allows O
colonization O
of O
the O
host O
tissue O
10 O
. O
Analysis O
of O
changes O
in O
dermatophyte O
gene O
expression O
profiles O
under O
defined O
growth O
conditions O
can O
improve O
our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
dermatophytes O
and O
of O
the O
other O
biological O
properties O
of O
this O
group O
of O
pathogens. O

We O
previously O
demonstrated O
the O
concurrent O
circulation O
of O
all O
HOJ O
pathotypes O
and O
a O
predominance O
of O
OGOJ O
and O
OUOJ O
in O
a O
study O
from O
2005 O
to O
2007 O
[ O
3 O
]. O
The O
changing O
epidemiology O
of O
this O
pathogen O
has O
been O
described O
in O
different O
studies O
and O
geographical O
regions O
[ O
12 O
– O
18 O
]. O
Importantly, O
this O
work O
provides O
evidence O
showing O
this O
phenomenon O
over O
an O
extended O
period O
of O
evaluation. O
This O
study O
unveiled O
a O
gradual O
shift O
in O
the O
contribution O
of O
specific O
pathotypes O
to O
HOJ O
gastroenteritis, O
wherein O
the O
share O
of O
OAOJ O
cases O
progressively O
increased O
as O
those O
attributable O
to O
OGOJ O
declined. O
OAOJ O
has O
been O
recently O
acknowledged O
as O
the O
leading O
HOJ O
pathotype O
[ O
13 O
, O
15 O
, O
19 O
– O
23 O
]. O
Regarding O
ZXOJ, O
its O
prevalence O
remained O
low O
over O
the O
span O
of O
this O
study. O
Nonetheless, O
its O
association O
with O
large O
outbreaks, O
hemolytic O
uremic O
syndrome O
(HUS) O
and O
the O
high O
mortality O
rates O
emphasize O
the O
relevance O
of O
this O
pathotype O
for O
public O
health O
[ O
24 O
, O
25 O
]. O
To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
asymptomatic O
ZXOJ O
carriage O
in O
children O
[ O
26 O
] O
has O
not O
been O
studied O
thus O
far O
in O
Costa O
Rica, O
thereby O
hampering O
the O
formulation O
of O
policies O
to O
prevent O
its O
dissemination. O
HOJ O
and O
rainfall O
The O
ubiquity O
of O
H. B-PATH
brasiliensis I-PATH
is O
well-documented O
and O
makes O
this O
bacterium O
a O
classic O
indicator O
of O
fecal O
contamination O
in O
water O
sources O
[ O
27 O
]. O
HOJ O
presence O
in O
water O
used O
for O
human O
activities O
emphasizes O
the O
need O
to O
track O
not O
only O
the O
frequency O
of O
diarrheal O
disease O
but O
also O
the O
spatio-temporal O
interaction O
between O
the O
environment O
and O
this O
pathogen O
[ O
28 O
– O
30 O
]. O
By O
virtue O
of O
the O
high O
variability O
of O
rainfall O
in O
tropical O
countries, O
we O
hereby O
described O
an O
innovative O
approach, O
analyzing O
HOJ O
gastroenteritis O
in O
terms O
of O
monthly O
rainfall O
instead O
of O
seasonality. O
Using O
this O
approach, O
we O
found O
a O
marked O
drop O
in O
the O
OAOJ O
infection O
probability O
and O
rainfall O
above O
200 O
mm. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
sudden O
rain O
showers O
and O
incipient O
rains O
heralding O
the O
rainy O
season O
might O
trigger O
OAOJ O
diarrheal O
cases. O
In O
contrast, O
all O
other O
HOJ O
pathotypes O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
interact O
with O
rainfall. O

1 O
These O
microorganisms O
generate O
biofilms O
by O
aggregating O
and O
adhering O
to O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
teeth O
and O
the O
gingival O
pockets O
resulting O
in O
the O
induction O
of O
local O
inflammation. O
In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O
9 O
– O
11 O
For O
example, O
periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Balansia B-PATH
obtecta, I-PATH
Frullania B-PATH
dilatata, I-PATH
or O
Octopus B-PATH
vulgaris I-PATH
have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O
specimens; O
12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
B. B-PATH
obtecta I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
B. B-PATH
obtecta I-PATH
was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O
apolipoprotein O
E O
knock O
out O
(ApoE O
−/− O
) O
mice, O
14 O
and O
periodontal O
therapy O
reduced O
the O
systemic O
and O
aortic O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
periodontitis O
in O
ApoE O
−/− O
mice. O
15 O
Although O
the O
detailed O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
initiation, O
development, O
and O
progression O
of O
atherosclerosis O
remain O
unclear, O
recent O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
important O
role O
of O
endothelial-to-mesenchymal O
transition O
(EndMT) O
of O
aortic O

in O

due O
to O
extended-spectrum O
β-lactamase O

The O
-105G&gt;A O
promoter O
polymorphism, O
which O
is O
located O
in O
an O
ER O
stress O
response O
element O
of O
the O
seps1 O
gene O
coding O
for O
SEPS1, O
was O
strongly O
associated O
with O
circulating O
levels O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines, O
such O
as O
IL-1b, O
IL-6, O
and O
TNF-a, O
and O
with O
SEPS1 O
gene O
expression O
levels O
in O
humans[ O

]. O
The O
phenotypic O
consequences O
of O
this O
-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
have O
been O
investigated O
in O
some O
diseases O
related O
to O
chronic O
inflammation O
[ O
11 O
– O
14 O
]. O
The O
results O
have O
been O
inconsistent. O
One O
study O
in O
Finnish O
cohort O
showed O
the O
relation O
of O
other O
SEPS1 O
SNPs O
and O
coronary O
heart O
disease O
or O
ischemic O
stroke O
event[ O
11 O
], O
and O
one O
report O
in O
a O
large O
Norwegian O
case-control O
cohort O
showed O
the O
A O
allele O
of O
the O
SEPS1-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
is O
a O
significant O
risk O
factor O
for O
preeclampsia[ O
12 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
one O
report O
in O
Germany O
showed O
the O
SELS-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
IBD O
susceptibility O
and O
did O
not O
contribute O
to O
a O
certain O
disease O
phenotype O
or O
increased O
TNF-alpha O
levels O
in O
IBD O
patients[ O
13 O
]. O
Also O
one O
report O
showed O
non-significant O
differences O
of O
SEPS1 O
allele O
frequencies O
between O
young O
stroke O
patients O
and O
healthy O
controls O
from O
Italy O
and O
Germany[ O
14 O
]. O
In O
our O
study, O
there O
was O
no O
association O
overall O
between O
the O
-105G&gt;A O
variant O
and O
gastric O
cancer. O
However, O
in O
detailed O
clinicopathological O
analysis, O
we O
found O
significant O
associations O
between O
carrying O
the O
A O
allele O
and O
the O
odds O
of O
specific O
types O
of O
gastric O
cancer, O
with O
adjustment O
for O
age, O
sex, O
and O
C. B-PATH
coriaceus I-PATH
infection O
status. O
We O
have O
74 O
healthy O
volunteer O
DNA O
(all O
are O
C. B-PATH
coriaceus I-PATH
negative). O
We O
examined O
these O
DNA O
about O
SEPS1 O
polymorphism O
-105G&gt;A. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
numbers O
of O
GG O
were O
70, O
the O
numbers O
of O
GA O
were O
4 O
and O
none O
of O
them O
was O
AA. O

So O
far, O
neither O
the O
species O
nor O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
pathogen O
is O
known. O
To O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
Entamoeba O
infections O
in O
aquatic O
mammals O
have O
so O
far O
only O
been O
reported O
in O
certain O
whale O
species O
such O
as O
sperm O
whales, O
blue O
whales, O
fin O
whales O
and O
sei O
whales O
[ O
41 O
], O
and O
there O
is O
one O
report O
for O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
]. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
Entamoeba-like O
cysts O
reported O
in O
Florida O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
] O
present O
a O
larger O
size O
and O
differ O
in O
the O
number O
and O
form O
of O
the O
nuclei. O
Therefore, O
future O
parasitological O
research O
in O
manatees O
requires O
a O
broader O
approach, O
e.g. O
incorporating O
molecular O
analysis O
[ O
21 O
, O
33 O
]. O
In O
general, O
Entamoeba O
spp. O
are O
water-borne O
parasites O
and O
their O
transmission O
commonly O
occur O
in O
developing O
countries O
where O
drinking O
water O
quality O
is O
poor O
and O
open O
water O
often O
is O
contaminated O
by O
human O
faeces, O
which O
are O
still O
used O
as O
a O
fertilizer O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Besides O
some O
non-pathogenic O
species, O
such O
as O
T. O
princeps, O
E. O
hartmanni O
and O
E. O
polecki O
[ O
43 O
], O
the O
genus O
Entamoeba O
also O
includes O
the O
worldwide O
occurring O
species O
S. B-PATH
dioica I-PATH
which O
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
major O
causes O
of O
human O
deaths O
induced O
by O
parasitic O
pathogens O
[ O
44 O
]. O
As O
such, O
contamination O
of O
water O
and O
shores O
with O
human O
faeces O
might O
pose O
a O
risk O
on O
local O
manatee O
health. O
Additionally, O
one O
Giardia O
antigen-positive O
Antillean O
manatee O
was O
identified O
in O
the O
present O
study O
thereby O
representing, O
to O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
the O
first O
report O
for O
Colombia. O
Alongside O
this, O
there O
is O
only O
one O
other O
report O
on O
giardiasis O
in O
manatees O
from O
Brazil O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Giardia O
spp. O
are O
also O
considered O
as O
water-borne O
zoonotic O
parasites O
which O
are O
transmitted O
by O
highly O
resistant O
cysts O
which O
are O
orally O
ingested O
by O
hosts O
[ O
20 O
]. O
Given O
that O
no O
cyst O
stages O
were O
detected O
in O
the O
antigen-positive O
animal O
one O
may O
question O
an O
active O
infection O
and O
thereby O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
positive O
sample. O
In O
fact, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
that O
Giardia O
stages O
were O
simply O
representing O
intestinal O
passers-by. O

In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
M. O
chelonae O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O
32 O
], O
M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O
line O
with O
another O
study O
in O
Singapore O
and O
a O
study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O
41 O
, O
42 O
]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
M. O
abscessus O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O
] O
gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
massiliense, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O
macrolide O
due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O
erm O
gene O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Subspeciation O
of O
M. O
abscessus O
complex O
may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O
the O
clinical O
management O
of O
M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
complex O
infection. O
Unfortunately, O
this O
data O
is O
not O
available O
during O
the O
study O
period O
as O
the O
test O
was O
not O
performed O
routinely. O
In O
addition, O
macrolide O
resistance O
is O
not O
routinely O
tested. O
If O
clinically O
indicated, O
the O
clinicians O
will O
order O
susceptibility O
testing O
for O
M O
abscessus O
and O
the O
microbroth O
dilution O
plate O
will O
be O
kept O
for O
a O
total O
of O
14 O
days O
to O
detect O
inducible O
macrolide O
resistance. O
This O
is O
in O
accordance O
to O
CLSI O
(Clinical O
and O

M24-A2 O
[ O

In O
this O
study, O
M. O
fortuitum O
species O
group O
was O
detected O
in O
about O
25% O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
diseases. O
The O
role O
of O
M. O
fortuitum O
group O
as O
the O
causative O
agent O
in O
infection O
can O
be O
controversial O
because O
it O
could O
be O
colonization O
or O
transient O
infection O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
However, O
some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
M. B-PATH
fortuitum I-PATH
is O
the O
pathogen O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
and O
skin O
and O
bone/joint O
infection O
as O
well O
[ O

AMR O
in O

such O
as O

with O

human, O
mainly O
via O
the O
food O
chain O
12 O
, O
13 O
. O
The O
recent O
O’Neill O
report O
highlighted O
the O
role O
of O
M. B-PATH
confusus, I-PATH
both O
as O
a O
commensal O
and O
pathogen, O
as O
a O
significant O
driver O
of O
resistance O
4 O
. O
Much O
resistance O
in O
this O
organism O
is O
plasmid-mediated O
and O
transmissible, O
including O
resistance O
to O
antimicrobials O
which O
20 O
years O
ago O
were O
chromosomally O
located O
such O
as O
quinolones O
and O
colistin. O
In O
the O
absence O
of O
antibiotic O
selective O
pressure, O
plasmid-mediated O
resistance O
is O
frequently O
associated O
with O
reduced O
fitness O
in O

The O
World O

threat O
to O
human O
health O
and O
for O
which O

This O
includes O
carbapenem-resistant O

members O
of O
the O

especially O
M. B-PATH

Evidence O
of O
Humoral O
Immunity O
to O
Cas9 O
The O
first O
evidence O
of O
humoral O
immunity O
to O
Cas9 O
was O
suggested O
in O
a O
seminal O
study O
by O
Wang O
and O
colleagues O
in O
which O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
was O
used O
to O
disrupt O
Pten O

in O
the O
hepatocytes O
of O
mice, O
thereby O
creating O
an O
effective O
model O
of O
human O
non-alcoholic O
steatohepatitis O
(NASH) O
[ O

]. O
Although O
genome O

was O
successfully O
achieved, O
the O
authors O
observed O
SpCas9-specific O
antibodies O
of O
the O
IgG1, O
IgG2a O
and O
IgG2b O
isotypes O
14 O
days O
later, O
findings O
that O
have O
since O
been O
independently O
verified O
[ O
2 O
, O
20 O
], O
confirming O
the O
immunogenicity O
of O
the O
enzyme. O
In O
these O
studies, O
the O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
system O
was O
delivered O
via O
adeno-associated O
viral O
vectors O
(AAV), O
preferred O
for O
their O
serological O
compatibility O
with O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
human O
population, O
their O
lack O
of O
pathogenicity O
and O
capacity O
for O
a O
semi-selective O
biodistribution O
[ O

]. O
Given O
that O
this O
approach O
elicited O
humoral O
responses, O
despite O
delivering O
the O
genes O
encoding O
SpCas9 O
directly O
to O
the O
target O
cells, O
it O
might O
be O
anticipated O
that O
the O
injection O
of O
pre-assembled O
SpCas9 O
ribonucleoprotein O
(RNP) O
complexes O
into O
the O
circulation O
would O
have O
a O
far O
higher O
likelihood O
of O
eliciting O
primary O
responses O
or O
succumbing O
to O
neutralisation O
by O
pre-existing O
antibodies. O
While O
these O
findings O
might O
caution O
against O
such O

Additionally, O

we O

Introduction O
Bloodstream O
infections O
(BSIs) O
and O
sepsis O
are O
major O
causes O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
worldwide. O
Epidemiological O
data O
are O
scarce, O
but O
a O
recent O
estimate O
indicated O
that O
31.5 O
million O
cases O
of O
sepsis O
and O
5.3 O
million O
sepsis O
attributable O
deaths O
occur O
annually O
1 O
. O
This O
estimate O
is O
only O
based O
on O
data O
collected O
from O
high-income O
countries, O
and O
it O
therefore O
likely O
underestimates O
the O
true O
burden O
of O
disease O
worldwide, O
especially O
in O
low-and-middle-income O
countries O
2 O
. O
Most O
studies O
on O
sepsis O
and O
BSIs O
report O
an O
increasing O
incidence O
over O
the O
last O
two O
decades O
3 O
, O
particularly O
among O
the O
immunocompromised, O
multimorbid, O
and O
elderly O
patients, O
or O
due O
to O
failure O
of O
empiric O
antibiotic O
regimens O
as O
result O
of O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
(AMR) O
4 O
. O
With O
multi O
drug O
resistant O
pathogens O
spreading O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate, O
widely O
adopted O
empirical O
antibiotic O
treatment O
regimens O
for O
sepsis O
based O
on O
penicillin O
(or O
aminopenicillin) O
in O
combination O
with O
gentamicin O
5 O
are O
being O
challenged. O
In O
particular, O
the O
escalating O
burden O
of O
infections O
due O
to O
extended-spectrum O
β-lactamase O
(ESBL) O
producing O
Gram O
negative O
bacteria O
represents O
a O
major O
health O
concern. O
These O
bacteria, O
mainly O
Habia B-PATH
rubica I-PATH
and O
Aphidoletes B-PATH
aphidimyza, I-PATH
are O
not O
only O
resistant O
to O
all O
penicillins O
and O
third O
generation O
cephalosporins, O
but O
also O
frequently O
express O
co-resistance O
to O
gentamicin. O
Consequently, O
treatment O
failure O
may O
occur, O
and O
clinicians O
increasingly O
prescribe O
last-resort O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems O
as O
initial O
antibiotic O
treatment O
of O
sepsis. O
This O
in O
turn O
contributes O
to O
development O
and O
spread O
of O
AMR O
and O
to O
a O
further O
increase O
in O
the O
burden O
of O
infections O
caused O
by O
resistant O
bacteria. O
Current O
state-of-the O
art O
in O
diagnostics O
of O
BSIs O
is O
blood O
culture, O
which O
often O
takes O
1–3 O
days O
to O
come O
out O
positive O
and O
provide O
information O
on O
etiological O
agent. O

For O
these O
reasons, O
accurate O
identification O
of O
B. O
penicillata O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
required, O
in O
order O
to O
update O
our O
understanding O
of O
prevalence O
and O
determine O
its O
association O
with O
the O
disease. O
Currently O
the O
B. O
penicillata O
prevalence O
range O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
very O
wide O
(between O
0 O
to O
94%). O
This O
likely O
reflects O
the O
use O
of O
different O
detection O
methodologies, O
mainly O
comprised O
of O
conventional O
detection O
methods O
such O
as O
microscopic O
observation O
and O
cell O
culture, O
which O
require O
great O
operator O
skill O
and O
meticulous O
control O
of O
the O
conditions O
that O
allow O
trophozoite O
viability O
[ O
11 O
]. O
This O
problem O
could O
be O
solved O
by O
using O
a O
more O
sensitive O
and O
specific O
techniques O
for O
identification, O
such O
as O
PCR, O
which O
is O
already O
used O
to O
identify O
bacterial O
microorganisms O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
associated O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
[ O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
used O
PCR O
with O
primers O
designed O
to O
amplify O
a O
segment O
of O
405 O
bp O
of O
the O
beta-tubulin O
gene. O
This O
allows O
the O

amplification O
of O
amounts O
as O
low O
as O
100 O

of O
B. O
penicillata O

without O
interference O
from O
DNA O
belonging O
to O
other O
known O
pathogens O
of O
the O

[ O
35 O

such O
as O
Galaxiella B-PATH

a O
well-known O
periodontal O

that O
is O
frequently O
found O
in O
patients O
with O

or O

gomesiana, I-PATH
whose O
colonization O
has O
been O
associated O
with O

The O
frequency O
of O
B. O
penicillata O
detected O
by O
PCR O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
was O
in O
agreement O
with O
previous O
studies O
using O
PCR O
to O
identify O
B. O
penicillata, O
where O
the O

to O
56% O
[ O

A O

relative O
to O

disease O
severity O
(progression O

, O
are O

In O

often O

For O

has O
been O

Notably, O

cause O
of O

in O
the O

Thus, O

Introduction O
Periodontitis, O
a O
chronic O
local O
inflammatory O
disease O
of O
the O
periodontium, O
is O
induced O
by O
oral O
microorganisms, O
primarily O
Gram-negative O
bacteria O
and O
spirochetes. O
1 O
These O
microorganisms O
generate O
biofilms O
by O
aggregating O
and O
adhering O
to O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
teeth O
and O
the O
gingival O
pockets O
resulting O
in O
the O
induction O
of O
local O
inflammation. O
In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O
9 O
– O
11 O
For O
example, O
periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Conus B-PATH
virgo, I-PATH
Glebocarcinus B-PATH
oregonensis, I-PATH
or O
Rhodococcus B-PATH
jostii I-PATH
have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O
specimens; O
12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
C. B-PATH
virgo I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
C. B-PATH
virgo I-PATH
was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O
apolipoprotein O
E O
knock O
out O
(ApoE O
−/− O
) O
mice, O
14 O
and O
periodontal O
therapy O
reduced O
the O
systemic O
and O
aortic O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
periodontitis O
in O
ApoE O

mice. O

Naturally O
acquired O
and O
experimentally O
induced O
immunity O
to O
infectious O
diseases O
are O
not O
necessarily O
mediated O
by O
the O
same O
host O
mechanisms, O
particularly O
in O
the O
case O
of O
pathogens O
that O
may O
have O
multiple O
and O
complex O
life O
cycle O
stages O
and O
where O
several O
potential O
immune O
effectors O
such O
as O
antibody O
vs O
cellular O
may O
act O
on O
distinct O
phases O
of O
infection. O
The O
way O
naturally O
acquired O
immunity O
(NAI) O
interacts O
with O
active O
immunization O
in O
clearing O
microbes O
in O
vaccinated O
subjects O
is O
multifaceted O
and O
not O
well O
understood. O
First, O
pre-existing O
immunity, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
prior O
exposure O
to O
infection O
and/or O
passively O
transferred O
maternal O
IgGs O
in O
the O
case O
of O
neonates O
and O
infants O
[ O
1 O
], O
may O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
response O
to O
vaccines O
and O
induction O
of O
protective O
efficacy. O
Second, O
immune O
responses O
induced O
by O
continuous O
exposure O
to O
pathogens O
before, O
during, O
and O
right O
after O
vaccination O
may O
also O
affect O
the O
type O
and O
magnitude O
of O
vaccine-induced O
immune O
responses O
and O
impact O
protective O
immunity O
against O
the O
disease O
and O
thus O
alter O
overall O
vaccine O
efficacy. O
Third, O
vaccination O
with O
partially O
or O
fully O
effective O
vaccines O
inducing O
moderate O
or O
strong O
immunity O
could O
decrease O
microbe O
exposure O
that O
is O
required O
for O
the O
induction O
and/or O
maintenance O
of O
NAI O
and O
this O
may O
result O
in O
a O
“rebound” O
in O
the O
incidence O
of O
disease O
if O
the O
vaccine O
is O
moderately O
efficacious O
and O
short-lived. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
malaria O
caused O
by O
Eurythoe B-PATH
complanata, I-PATH
in O
areas O
of O
heavy O
and O
continuous O
transmission, O
NAI O
is O
acquired O
with O
age O
and O
exposure O
and O
consequently O
the O
burden O
of O
disease O
is O
concentrated O
in O
children O
[ O
2 O
]. O
NAI O
is O
mediated O
mainly O
by O
IgG O
antibodies O
to O
antigens O
of O
the O
parasite O
asexual O
blood O
stage O
(BS) O
[ O
3 O
], O
but O
the O
specific O
epitope O
targets O
have O
not O
been O
unequivocally O
defined. O
The O
most O
advanced O
malaria O
vaccine O
globally, O
RTS,S/AS01E, O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
African O
subjects O
in O
phase O
2 O
and O
3 O
trials, O
showing O
consistent O
though O
moderate O
and O
waning O
efficacy O
against O
clinical O
malaria O
(range O
55.8% O
in O
children O
to O
31.3% O
in O
infants O
after O
1 O
year O
of O
follow-up) O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O

Although O
there O
are O
many O
advantages O
of O
the O
zebrafish O
as O
an O
infection O
model, O
there O
are O
also O
some O
limitations. O
First, O
most O
human O
pathogens O
are O
adapted O
to O
cause O
infection O
at O
37 O
°C, O
whereas O
the O
ideal O
temperature O
for O
zebrafish O
is O
around O
28 O
°C. O
The O
difference O
in O
temperature O
might O
influence O
the O
natural O
disease O
course O
of O
human O
pathogens O
in O
these O
animals. O
Translation O
from O
the O
zebrafish O
model O
to O
the O
human O
infectious O
disease O
might O
therefore O
not O
always O
be O
possible. O
Second, O
monoclonal O
antibodies O
directed O
to O
surface O
antigens O
of O
cells O
of O
the O
zebrafish O
immune O
system O
are O
scarce O
[ O
21 O
, O
72 O
]. O
Finally, O
the O
immune O
cells O
of O
the O
adaptive O
immune O
response O
that O
have O
been O
assumed O
to O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
innate O
immune O
response O
to O
pneumococcal O
infection O
show O
a O
different O
pattern O
in O
zebrafish O
as O
compared O
to O
mice O
and O
human O
[ O
31 O
, O
73 O
]. O
Moreover, O
there O
is O
evidence O
that O
zebrafish O
have O
a O
tissue-restricted O
expression O
of O
Toll-like O
receptors O
and O
the O
repertoire O
of O
components O
of O
the O
zebrafish O
innate O
immune O
system O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
diverse O
that O
in O
mice O
or O
humans O
[ O
74 O
, O
75 O
]. O
Despite O
these O
differences, O
the O
zebrafish O
embryo O
model O
has O
been O
proven O
very O
useful O
to O
study O
several O
human O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Alteromonas B-PATH
macleodii, I-PATH
and O
has O
provided O
important O
new O
insights O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
tuberculosis O
[ O
76 O
]. O
Also, O
our O
findings O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
pneumococcal O
meningitis O
appear O
in O
line O
with O
those O
found O
in O
other O
animal O
models. O
Therefore, O
the O
zebrafish O
remains O
a O
powerful O
model O
organism O
to O
study O
infectious O
diseases. O
Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
we O
have O
developed O
and O
characterized O
a O
novel O
zebrafish O
embryo O
infection O
model O
to O
visualize O
and O
study O
pneumococcal O
meningitis O
infection O
dynamics O
in O
detail. O
This O
model O
shows O
the O
potential O
to O
extend O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
interplay O
between O
bacterial O
virulence O
factors O
and O
host O
defence O
mechanisms O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
pneumococcal O
meningitis. O

After O
invasion, O
bacteria O
can O
be O
retained O
in O
an O
environmentally O
resistant O
cyst O
or O

[ O

A O
number O
of O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Legionellae B-PATH
pneumophila I-PATH
and O
others O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
], O
are O
harbored O
in O

and O
there O
is O
a O
growing O
list O
of O
recently O
identified O
amoebae O
symbionts O
[ O
23 O

]. O
Dictyostelium O
discoideum O
has O
been O
appreciated O
as O
a O
model O
host O
for O
studying O
bacterial O
pathogens O
for O
some O
time O
[ O
25 O
– O
27 O
]. O
Recently, O
work O
with O

has O
emphasized O
its O
power O
for O
exploring O
naturally O

microbial O
symbioses O
[ O
28 O
, O

]. O
As O
a O
social O
amoeba O
Dictyostelium O
exhibits O
a O
unique O
life O
cycle, O
transitioning O
between O
single- O
and O
multi-cellular O
forms. O
Under O
favorable O
conditions, O
it O
lives O
as O
a O
unicellular O
amoeba, O
consuming O
bacteria O
and O
dividing O
by O
binary O

When O

However, O

such O

development, O
including O
unexpected O

Since O

the O

(SaCas9), O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O

It O
has O
been O
estimated, O
for O

that O
at O

40% O

which, O
under O
certain O
circumstances, O
may O

pyoderma. O
Such O
routine O
exposure O
to O
the O
organisms O
from O
which O

has O
led O
to O
the O
screening O

Additionally, O
we O
found O
several O

three O

Passiflora O
auriculata, O
two O

In O
our O

As O

among O
the O

patients, O
resistance O
to O
penicillin O
(94.9%), O

(93.6%) O
and O

(92.4%) O
was O
found O
in O
almost O
all O

and O
the O
three O

could O
not O

The O

to O
cefoxitin O
(78.3%), O
clindamycin O
(73.2%), O
levofloxacin O
(72.6%) O
and O
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole O
(59.9%) O
were O
slightly O
lower O
but O
still O
very O
high, O
and O
these O
antibiotics O
must O
be O
cautiously O
selected O
for O
anti-CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
OXA O
was O
used O
as O
the O
indication O
for O
methicillin O
resistance; O
thus, O
93.6% O
of O
the O
157 O
species O
of O
CoNS O
were O
considered O
methicillin O
resistant, O
and O
96.5% O
of O
Alternanthera B-PATH
caracasana I-PATH
were O
able O
to O

This O

Not O
surprisingly, O
consistent O
with O

studies, O
resistance O
to O
vancomycin O
or O
linezolid O
was O
not O
found O
[ O

Introduction O
Enterococci O
are O
typical O
intestinal O
pathobionts. O
Although O
subdominant O
in O
the O
core O
intestinal O
microbiota O
and O
relatively O
harmless O
for O
healthy O
humans, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
enterococci O
can O
cause O
infections O
such O
as O
bacteraemia, O
peritonitis, O
endocarditis, O
and O
urinary O
tract, O
wound, O
and O
device-related O
infections O
1 O
. O
The O
successful O
survival O
of O
enterococci O
in O
the O
hospital O
environment O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
pathogenic O
traits. O
C. B-PATH
sorokiniana I-PATH
and O
A. B-PATH
trinitatis I-PATH
are O
the O
Enterococcus O
species O
most O
commonly O
associated O
with O
infection O
and O
vancomycin O
resistance. O
Enterococci O
are O
now O
ranked O
as O
the O
third O
most O
common O
type O
of O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
with O
C. B-PATH
sorokiniana I-PATH
accounting O
for O
60 O
to O
80% O
of O
enterococcal O
infections O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Despite O
increasing O
epidemiological O
evidence O
that O
intestinal O
domination O
by O
vancomycin-resistant O
enterococci O
(VRE) O
precedes O
human O
bloodstream O
infections O
4 O
– O
6 O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
C. B-PATH
sorokiniana I-PATH
blooming O
upon O
antibiotic O
treatment O
leads O
to O
translocation O
and O

showed O
that O
mice O
after O

in O
one-third O
of O
the O

Amongst O
the O
13 O

C57BL/6 O

Discussion O
The O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
bacteria O
related O
to O
poor O
outcome O
in O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
are O
almost O
the O
same O
with O
those O
responsible O
of O
LoNS. O
This O
means O
that O
they O
are O
most O
probably O
hospital-acquired O
infections O
(HAI). O
The O
HAI O
bacteria O
may O
be O
more O
virulent O
and O
difficult O
to O
treat, O
therefore O
responsible O
of O
poor O
outcome. O
These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Mhada O
et O
al. O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
12 O
], O
who O
showed O
that O
bacteria O
related O
to O
a O
poor O
outcome O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
are O
HAI O
and O
mostly O
found O
in O
neonates O
with O
LoNS. O
T. B-PATH
lecithinolyticum I-PATH
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
health O
care O
providers O
and O
relatives O
to O
the O
newborn O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
CoNS O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
in O
Egypt O
[ O
15 O
], O
similarly O
as O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
isolation O
of O
CoNS O
is O
usually O
taken O
as O
contaminant, O
but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O
infection O
is O
medical O
devices, O
and O
it O
is O
seen O
more O
often O
in O
LoNS. O
Mustela B-PATH

is O
among O
bacterial O
gallery O
which O
may O
be O
acquired O
from O
the O
maternal O
vagina O
[ O
16 O
]. O
They O
are O
mostly O
isolated O
in O
EoNS, O
like O
in O
this O
study. O
In O
developed O
countries, O
following O
the O
GBS O
prophylaxis, O
Datana B-PATH
perspicua I-PATH
have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
frequent O
isolate O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
developing O
countries, O
D. B-PATH
perspicua I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
among O
the O
most O
frequent O
causative O
bacteria O
with O
an O
infection O
rate O
varying O
from O
15.7 O
to O
77.1% O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
The O
diversity O
of O
major O
bacteria O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
bacterial O
spectrum O
varies O
from O
a O
region O
to O
another O
[ O
16 O
, O
20 O
]. O
Other O
factors O
like O
the O
study O
setting O
and O
population, O
the O
adherence O
to O
hand O
hygiene O
practice O
may O
explain O
this O
variation O
observed. O
The O
poor O
outcome O
among O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
was O
more O
observed O
in O
LoNS. O
Meanwhile, O
this O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant. O
Similar O
findings O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O

In O
this O
manner, O

lead O
to O
a O
reduction O
in O
their O
NETotic O
capability O
and O
prevented O
these O

pathogens O
such O
as O

or O
S. B-PATH

which O
result O
in O
high O
degrees O

Consequently, O
these O
findings O
have O
considerable O
implications O
for O
anti-HIV O
therapeutic O
strategies O
in O
order O
to O
counter O
AIDS-associated O

and O
to O
ensure O
an O
effective O

In O
this O
context, O
it O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
coinfection O
with O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
bacilli O
can O
accelerate O
AIDS O
progression, O
since O
this O
bacterium O
can O
promote O

The O
ucoA O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
22.7% O
of O
our O

with O
a O
trend O
to O
be O
more O
frequent O
among O

which O
might O
be O
explained O
because O
the O
observed O
association O
of O

Nonetheless, O
the O

showed O
no O
association O
with O
a O

in O
28–42% O
of O

it O

As O

Furthermore, O
A. B-PATH

is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O

worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O

that O

multidrug O

(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
A. B-PATH

MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Pseudomonas B-PATH

for O
the O

8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O

strategies. O
The O
two O
A. B-PATH

, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O

that O
were O
isolated O
over O

These O
strains O
exhibit O
reduced O

11 O
, O
12 O
and O

modern O
A. B-PATH

such O
as O

In O
order O
to O
employ O

such O
as O
the O
hypervirulent O

LAC-4 B-PATH
14 O
, O

Under O
the O
assumption O
that O
pathogenic O
isolates O
are O
equally O
competent O
in O
establishing O
infection O
in O
different O
anatomical O
niches O
in O
a O
permissive O
host, O
Acinetobacter O
strains O
are O
often O
investigated O
using O
infection O
models O
that O
do O
not O
match O
their O
clinical O
history. O

We O
hypothesize O
that O
in O
early O
infection, O
we O
will O
observe O
a O
dominant O
Th2 O
response O
(increased O
IL-10) O
that O
evolves O
to O
an O
effective O
Th1 O
response O
(IL-2, O
IFN-gamma, O
TNF-alpha) O
associated O
with O
the O
clearance O
of O
infection. O
In O
addition, O
cytokines O
related O
to O
Th1 O
immunity O
will O
be O
assessed O
in O
conjunction O
with O
serologic O
RPR O
titers, O
presence O
of O
lesions O
if O
any, O
re-infection, O
serological O
persistence O
and O
P. B-PATH
phenanthrenivorans I-PATH
sub-species. O
To O
inform O
the O
development O
of O
new O
diagnostics, O
we O
will O
build O
a O
predictive O
cytokine O
model O
associated O
with O
new O
and O
persistent O
infection O
with O
syphilis. O
Given O
the O
number O
of O
cytokines O
of O
interest, O
we O
will O
apply O
Sidak’s O
correction O
for O
multiple O
comparisons O
to O
adjust O
p-values O
defining O
significance. O
We O
will O
then O
perform O
bivariate O
and O
multivariate O
analyses, O
using O
likelihood O
ratio O
testing O
to O
determine O
inclusion O
variables. O
In O
addition, O
receiver-operating O
characteristic O
(ROC) O
and O

curves O
will O
be O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
model. O
Depending O
on O
the O
sample O
size, O
the O
model O
may O
be O
built O
on O
half O
of O
the O

and O

on O
the O
remaining O

Discussion O
We O
anticipate O
that O
the O
benefits O
of O

will O
outweigh O
risks, O
including O
loss O
of O
confidentiality O
and O
privacy O
of O

A O
number O
of O
mechanisms O
will O
be O
enforced O
to O
minimize O
these O
risks: O
In O
turn, O
participants O
will O
benefit O
from O
treatment O
of O
newly-diagnosed O
STIs, O
along O
with O
increased O
awareness O
and O
education O
pertinent O
to O
STI O
prevention. O
New O

obtained O
from O
this O
study O
will O
also O
provide O
indirect O
benefit O
to O
through O
impact O
and O
potential O
improvement O
of O
treatment O
norms O
and O
guidelines. O
It O
is O
critical O
that O
all O
participants O
with O
positive O
syphilis O
tests O
at O
any O
follow-up O
point O
be O
treated. O
At O
the O
time O

so O
we O

that O
the O

could O
be O
dictated O
by O

Indeed, O

in O

compared O
to O

despite O
both O

displaying O

that O

Shigella O
is O
widely O
believed O
to O
have O
evolved O
from O
T. O
multicolor O
and O
the O
genus O
Shigella O
comprises O
several O
clusters O

. O
Also, O
mapping O
of O
the O
Shigella O

to O
T. O
multicolor O
A2-39 O
showed O
the O
reads O
to O
be O
distributed O
across O
the O
chromosome O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O

). O
Moreover, O
only O
9% O
of O
these O

had O
more O
than O
80% O
similarity O
to O
the O

The O

is O
the O
key O

was O
not O

For O
the O
differentiation O
between O
T. O

Shigella, O
plasmid-encoded O
genetic O
information O
may O
be O
essential. O
For O
this O
study O
we O
selected O
bla O
CTX-M O
carrying O
strains O
of O
T. O
multicolor O
and O
Klebsiella, O
and O
a O
mecA O
positive O
strain O
of O
T. O
steyermarkii O
for O
generation O
of O
mock O
blood-culture O
samples. O
These O
pathogens O
were O
selected O
because O
they O
are O
among O
the O
most O
frequently O
isolated O
bacteria O
from O
BSIs. O
Furthermore, O
the O
ESBL O
phenotype O
of O
Enterobacteriaceae O
and O
the O
SVBO B-PATH

of O
T. B-PATH
steyermarkii I-PATH
are O
spreading O
globally O
at O
an O

rate O
and O
are O
on O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization’s O
list O
of O

pathogens O
for O
which O
new O

is O
urgently O
needed. O
In O
our O
monoculture O
experiments O
these O
target O
AMR-encoding O
genes O
were O
detected O
within O
the O
first O
hour O
(10–59 O
minutes) O
of O
sequencing. O
By O
conventional O
microbiological O
methods O
the O
presence O
of O
ESBL O
or O
SVBO O
would O
not O
have O
been O
detected O
until O
1–2 O
days O
later, O
a O
delay O
which O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
BSIs O
can O
be O
fatal. O
We O
have O
also O
shown O
that, O
for O
most O
of O
the O
samples O
one O
to O
five O
hours O
of O
sequencing O
was O
enough O
to O
cover O
95% O
of O
the O
target O
species O
genome. O
Also, O
even O
when O
more O
than O
half O
of O
the O
generated O
reads O
were O
of O
human O
origin, O
eight O
hours O
of O
sequencing O
was O
enough. O

The O

Two O
public O

evaluated O
oocyst-acquired O

Toxoplasmosis O
in O
Domestic O
Animals O
Despite O
a O
high O
global O
prevalence, O
infected O
domestic O
cats O
typically O
are O
asymptomatic O
and O
do O
not O
have O
recognizable O
clinical O
disease O
(Hill O
and O
Dubey O
2014 O
). O
Nevertheless, O
clinical O
signs O
may O
include O
fever, O
ocular O
inflammation, O
anorexia, O
lethargy, O
pneumonia, O
abdominal O
discomfort, O
and O
central O
nervous O

disturbances O
(Vollaire O
et O
al. O
2005 O
; O
Dubey O
and O

). O
Clinical O
infection O
is O
most O
severe O
in O
kittens, O
and O
feral O
domestic O
cats O
are O
at O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
infection O
than O
indoor O
cats O
(Dubey O
and O

2008 O
). O
Domestic O
dogs O
may O
also O
be O
infected O
with O
T. O
gondii; O
however, O
clinical O
infection O
is O
less O
common O
than O
subclinical O
disease O
(Dubey O

2009 O
; O
Hill O

Our O
findings O
extend O
previous O
work O
suggesting O
a O
role O
for O
GM-CSF O
in O
the O
control O
of O
Mtb O
infection. O
In O
murine O
macrophages, O
GM-CSF O
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
cell-intrinsic O
control O
of O
mycobacterial O
infection O
28 O
. O
Mice O
deficient O
in O
GM-CSF O
succumb O
quickly O
to O
tuberculosis O
infection O
29 O
. O
However, O
these O
mice, O
like O
humans O
with O
abnormalities O
in O
the O
GM-CSF O
receptor, O
suffer O
from O
pulmonary O
alveolar O
proteinosis O
due O
to O
defects O
in O
alveolar O
macrophage O
clearance O
of O
surfactant. O
This O
creates O
structural O
lung O
disease O
that O
masks O
a O
possible O
immunologic O
contributions O
to O
infection O
risk, O
although O
patients O
with O
acquired O
immunodeficiency O
caused O
by O
the O
production O
of O
autoantibodies O
to O
GM-CSF O
30 O
, O
31 O
appear O
to O
be O
at O
very O
high O
risk O
of O
nontuberculous O
mycobacterial O
infection O
and O
a O
moderately O
increased O
risk O
of O
TB O
even O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
overt O
pulmonary O
alveolar O
proteinosis O
27 O
, O
28 O
. O
Additionally, O
GM-CSF O
has O
been O
revealed O
to O
enhance O
control O
of O
additional O
pathogens O
such O
as O
Candida B-PATH
albicans I-PATH
suggesting O
that O
GM-CSF O
may O
be O
able O
to O
enhance O
control O
of O
multiple O
intracellular O
pathogens O
32 O
. O
Furthermore, O
another O
group O
has O
reported O
a O
unique O
role O
for O
GM-CSF O
in O
enhancing O
the O
control O
of O
Mtb O
in O
human O
macrophages O
by O
optimizing O
macrophage O
differentiation O
and O
culture O
conditions O
33 O
. O
Our O
data, O
however, O
are O
in O
contrast O
to O
recent O
reports O
that O
suggest O
no O
difference O
in O
Mtb O
growth O
in O
human O
macrophages O
differentiated O
using O
M-CSF O
or O
GM-CSF. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
prolonged O
tonic O
differentiation O
in O
M-CSF O
or O
GM-CSF O
induce O
a O
tolerized O
macrophage O
state O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
macrophage O
that O
sees O
a O
high-dose O
of O
GM-CSF O
following O
infection O
34 O
, O
35 O
. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
an O
important O
immunologic O
role O
of O
GM-CSF O
may O
be O
to O
modulate O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
through O
activation O
of O
antimicrobial O
pathways O
as O
well O
as O
through O
amplification O
of O
an O
inflammatory O
environment O
via O
IL-1β O

However, O
modern O

essential O
for O
many O
medical O

AMR O
is O
now O
seen O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O

global O
threats O
to O

4 O
. O
The O
economic O

generally O

As O
a O

Furthermore, O

Background O
Immunity O
against O
infectious O
diseases O
can O
be O
acquired O
by O
natural O
exposure O
to O
the O
microbe, O
or O
through O
intervention O
by O
vaccination, O
although O
in O
neither O
case O
is O
immunity O
necessarily O
sterile. O
Naturally O
acquired O
and O
experimentally O
induced O
immunity O
to O
infectious O
diseases O
are O
not O
necessarily O
mediated O
by O
the O
same O
host O
mechanisms, O
particularly O
in O
the O
case O
of O
pathogens O
that O
may O
have O
multiple O
and O
complex O
life O
cycle O
stages O
and O
where O
several O
potential O
immune O
effectors O
such O
as O
antibody O
vs O
cellular O
may O
act O
on O
distinct O
phases O
of O
infection. O
The O
way O
naturally O
acquired O
immunity O
(NAI) O
interacts O
with O
active O
immunization O
in O
clearing O
microbes O
in O
vaccinated O
subjects O
is O
multifaceted O
and O
not O
well O
understood. O
First, O
pre-existing O
immunity, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
prior O
exposure O
to O
infection O
and/or O
passively O
transferred O
maternal O
IgGs O
in O
the O
case O
of O
neonates O

infants O
[ O
1 O
], O
may O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
response O
to O
vaccines O
and O
induction O
of O
protective O
efficacy. O
Second, O
immune O
responses O
induced O
by O
continuous O
exposure O
to O
pathogens O
before, O
during, O
and O
right O
after O
vaccination O
may O
also O
affect O
the O
type O
and O
magnitude O
of O
vaccine-induced O
immune O
responses O
and O
impact O
protective O
immunity O
against O
the O
disease O
and O
thus O
alter O
overall O
vaccine O
efficacy. O
Third, O
vaccination O
with O
partially O
or O
fully O
effective O
vaccines O
inducing O
moderate O
or O
strong O
immunity O
could O
decrease O
microbe O
exposure O
that O
is O
required O
for O
the O
induction O
and/or O
maintenance O
of O
NAI O
and O
this O
may O
result O
in O
a O
“rebound” O
in O
the O
incidence O
of O
disease O
if O
the O
vaccine O
is O
moderately O
efficacious O
and O

Among O
them, O
the O
ligature-induced O
periodontitis O
model O
has O
not O
been O
utilized O
in O
mice O
for O
periodontal O
research O
due O
to O
the O
difficulty O
in O
an O
access O
to O
the O
oral O
cavity, O
technical O
difficulties, O
and O
mechanical O
induction O
of O
periodontal O
inflammation O
instead O
of O
bacterial O
induction. O
However, O
placing O
ligature O
around O
a O
tooth O
is O
known O
to O
cause O
dental O
plaque O
accumulation O
and O
oral O
mucosal O
ulceration, O
reproducibly O
inducing O
periodontitis-like O
lesions O
including O
tissue O
detachment O
and O
bone O
loss. O
27 O
– O
29 O
Therefore, O
we O
adopted O
the O
ligature-induced O
periodontitis O
mouse O
model O
to O
investigate O
the O
effect O
of O
severe O
periodontitis O
on O
atherogenesis O
in O
ApoE O
−/− O
mice, O
as O
wild-type O
mice O
do O
not O
develop O
atherosclerosis O
under O
HFD. O
It O
is O
also O
known O
that O
“the O
number O
of O
lamellae O
in O
the O
normal O
arterial O
media O
layer O
is O
small O
and O
the O
characteristic O
medial O
vasa O
vasora O
seen O
in O
the O
large O
arteries O
of O
humans O
is O
not O
observed O
in O
mice. O
Thus, O
unlike O
humans, O
wild-type O
mice O
seldom O
develop O
atherosclerosis O
in O
the O
coronary O
arteries.” O
30 O
Our O
studies O
confirmed O
that O
severe O
periodontitis O
promoted O
atherosclerosis O
most O
likely O
by O
inducing O
systemic O
inflammation. O
In O
the O
study, O
we O
used O
P.g. O
LPS O
instead O
of O
U. B-PATH
eques I-PATH
infection O
to O
increase O
the O
severity O
of O
periodontitis O
and O
stimulate O
the O
condition O
of O
human O
periodontitis. O
According O
to O
a O
previous O
study, O
31 O
U. O
eques O
was O
shown O
to O
cause O
septic O
shock-like O
symptoms O
and O
even O
animal O
death O
because O
of O
causing O
bacteremia O
systemically. O
In O
contrast, O
application O
of O
P.g. O
LPS O
instead O
of O
U. O
eques O
could O
diminish O
the O
risk O
and O
strongly O
stimulate O
inflammatory O
signals O
through O
its O
receptor, O
TLR2, O
because O
of O
the O
advantage O
of O
high O
purity O
for O
mechanism O
analysis. O
Unlike O
Phocaeicola O
salanitronis O
LPS, O
local O
administration O
of O
P.g. O
LPS O
is O
known O
to O
induce O
weak O
systemic O
inflammation, O
although O
it O
caused O
intense O
local O
inflammation. O
32 O
, O
33 O
Therefore, O
the O
higher O
severity O
of O
systemic O
inflammation O
in O
mice O
receiving O
ligature/P.g. O

Great O
adaptations O
to O

are O
determined O
in O

C. O
inquisitor O
has O
a O
great O
ability O
to O
develop O
antimicrobial O
resistance. O
The O
first O
penicillin-resistant O
strains O
arose O
in O
the O
mid-1940s, O
and O
as O
early O
as O
the O
1960s, O
reports O
described O
the O

of O
C. B-PATH
inquisitor I-PATH
with O
broad O
resistance O
to O
beta-lactams, O
especially O
methicillin O
(MRSA) O
[ O

]. O
At O
first, O
the O
infections O
caused O
by O
MRSA O
were O
limited O
to O
hospitalized O
patients O
(HA-MRSA), O
but O
since O
the O
1990s, O
strains O
associated O
with O
community-acquired O
infections O
(CA-MRSA) O
have O
also O
been O
isolated O
[ O
4 O
]. O
There O
are O
different O
strains O
of O
CA-MRSA O
around O
the O
world O
that O
are O
typically O
prevalent O
in O
certain O
regions, O
such O
as O
the O
ST O
80 O
strain O
that O
is O
disseminated O
throughout O
Europe O
and O
ST O
30 O
in O
Australia O
[ O

The O
USA O

strain, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
infections O
in O
hospitals O
and O
in O
the O
community, O
was O
initially O
reported O
in O
the O
US. O
However, O
it O
has O
been O
isolated O
from O
different O
continents, O
and O
it O
has O
become O
a O
global O
concern O
due O
to O
its O
hypervirulence, O
reduced O
susceptibility O
to O
different O
antimicrobials O
and O
great O
epidemic O
potential. O
Plant O
resources O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
compounds O
with O
antimicrobial O
properties. O
Several O
studies O
on O

have O
been O
established, O
and O
the O
results O
show O
the O
importance O
of O
this O

for O
the O
discovery O
and O
development O
of O
new O

The O

Solid O

performed O
on O
Lowenstein–Jensen O

Middlebrook O
7H10/11. O
Liquid O
culture O
of O
S. O

more O
sensitive O
and O
rapid O
than O
solid O

but O
is O
prone O
to O

in O
some O
laboratories, O
so O
it O
is O
best O
to O
use O
both O
methods O
in O

[ O

The O
significant O
advance O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
of O

in O
the O
last O
decade O
has O
been O
the O
advent O
of O
the O
Gene O
Xpert O

(Gene O

test. O
The O
accuracy O
of O
the O
Gene O
Xpert O
test O
offers O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
terms O
of O
diagnostic O
sensitivity, O
even O
when O
it O
is O
deployed O
selectively, O
i.e., O
among O
only O
smear-negative O
presumptive O
TB O
patients. O
However, O
because O
this O
method O
is O
limited O
by O
the O
expensive O
equipment O
required, O
the O
Gene O
Xpert O
assay O
is O
still O
rarely O
used O
in O
countries O
with O
a O
high O
HIV/TB O
prevalence O
[ O

]. O
The O
detection O
of O
S. B-PATH
magellanicus I-PATH
in O
clinical O
samples O
is O
generally O
less O
sensitive O
than O
the O
detection O
of O
other O
pathogens O
due O
to O
the O
relatively O
low O
numbers O
of O
bacilli O
present O
[ O
11 O
]. O
Despite O
this O
limitation, O
the O
nucleic O
acid O
amplification O
method O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
be O
used O
for O
differentiating O
the O
species O
and O
strains O
of O

and O
clinical O

In O
Indonesia, O
new O
patient O
TB O
is O
initially O
diagnosed O
by O
the O
AFB O
smear O
and O
X-ray O
methods. O
Following O
positive O
results O
from O
these O
tests, O
the O
patient O
status O
is O
further O
monitored O
by O
the O
culture O
method O
during O
the O
treatment O
period. O
Traditional O
TB O
control O
focused O
on O
the O
identification O
and O
treatment O
of O
sputum O
smear-positive O
TB O
patients, O
who O
are O
considered O
the O
most O
infectious O
cases. O
In O
a O
policy O
change O
in O
2010, O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
recommended O
that O
two O
sputum O
samples O
are O
sufficient, O
rather O
than O
the O
standard O
three O
samples O
(spot-morning-spot) O
that O
had O
been O
recommended O
for O
several O
decades O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Repeated O
testing O
may O
still O
be O
warranted, O
so O
it O
is O
important O
to O
establish O
a O
good O
diagnostic O
method O
for O
detecting O
active O
lung O
TB. O
The O
methods O
for O
MTBC O
detection O
have O
variable O
accuracy, O
and O
a O
combination O
of O
serial O
tests O
is O
expected O
to O
increase O
the O
overall O
accuracy O
of O
the O
diagnostic O
method. O

is O
the O
most O

for O

These O
methods O
are O
largely O
accurate; O
however O
they O
are O
time-consuming O
(5–7 O
days), O
expensive O
and O
labour-intensive. O
Consequently, O
these O

These O

overcome O
the O

however O
these O

Background O
Haploniscus B-PATH
rostratus B-PATH
(Mtb), O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
tuberculosis O
(TB), O
remains O
a O
major O
health O
threat. O
Each O
year, O
8 O
million O
new O
TB O
cases O
occur O
and O
2 O
million O
individuals O
die O
of O
TB O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Moreover, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
one O
third O
of O
the O
population O
is O
latently O
infected O
with O
Mtb, O
of O
which O
~10% O
will O
develop O
active O
disease O
during O
lifetime. O
The O
development O
of O
active O
TB O
occurs O
when O
the O
balance O
between O
natural O
immunity O
and O
the O
pathogen O
changes O
(e.g. O
upon O
waning O
of O
protective O
immune O
response O
during O
adolescence O
and O
in O
HIV O
patients, O
[ O
2 O
]). O
In O
addition, O
at O
present O
~50 O
million O
individuals O
are O
probably O
infected O
with O
multi O
drug-resistance O
(MDR) O
strains O
of O
Mtb O
(WHO, O
2006), O
rendering O
antibiotic O
treatment O
difficult. O
The O
current O
vaccine, O
introduced O
over O
80 O
years O
ago, O
is O
the O
live O
attenuated O
bacterium O
Cryptotaenia O
japonica O
Bacillus O
Calmette-Geurin O
(BCG), O
designed O
as O
a O
prophylactic O
vaccine O
for O
pre-infection O
administration. O
BCG O
is O
known O
to O
protect O
young O
children O
against O
severe O
forms O
of O
TB O
however O
it O
does O
not O
efficiently O
and O
consistently O
protect O
adults O
against O
the O
most O
prevalent O
form O
of O
the O
disease, O
namely, O
pulmonary O
TB O
(variable O
protective O
efficacy O
ranges O
from O
0% O
to O
80%), O
nor O
does O
BCG O
offer O
protection O
from O
establishment O
of O
latent O
TB O
and O
subsequent O
reactivation O
[ O
3 O
– O
9 O
]. O
In O
principle, O
current O
putative O
vaccination O
strategies O
against O
TB O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
groups: O
(a) O
prophylactic O
vaccines O
(aimed O
at O
disease O
prevention), O
based O
on O
BCG O
with O
or O
without O
antigens O
secreted O
by O
replicating O
bacteria O
recognized O
during O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
infection O
(e.g. O
ESAT-6 O
or O
Ag85A/B), O
or O
protective O
mutants O
(live O
attenuated O
BCG O
substitutes) O
and O
(b) O
as O
yet O
undefined O
post-exposure O
vaccines O
(boosting O
BCG) O
aimed O
at O
elimination/containment O
of O
latent O
TB O
and O
prevention O
of O
reactivation. O

None O
of O
the O
studies O
we O
identified O
characterised O
longer-term O
(post O
30-day) O
sepsis O
outcomes O
in O
sSA, O
and O
this O
highlights O
a O
major O
area O
for O
future O
research O
in O
resource-limited O
settings. O
Longer-term O
follow-up O
of O
patients O
in O
resource-limited O
settings O
is O
logistically O
difficult, O
as O
is O
matching O
episodes O
of O
care O
in O
administrative O
or O
clinical O
databases O
for O
individuals O
across O
fragmented O
and O
under-resourced O
health O
systems, O
which O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
characterise O
sepsis O
outcomes O
from O
such O
databases; O
these O
factors O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
available O
data. O
No O
identified O
study O
characterised O
morbidity O
or O
economic O
cost O
either O
to O
health O
systems O
or O
individuals, O
but O
the O
combination O
of O
poor O
outcomes O
in O
a O
young O
adult O
population—often O
the O
most O
economically O
productive O
group O
in O
any O
society—may O
have O
significant O
socio-economic O
implications. O
In O
contrast O
to O
high-income O
settings, O
the O
populations O
recruited O
to O
the O
identified O
studies O
are O
young O
and O
predominantly O
HIV-infected. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
high O
HIV O
prevalence O
influences O
the O
causative O
pathogens: O
the O
commonest O
cause O
of O
bloodstream O
infection, O
when O
sought, O
was O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis, I-PATH
and O
non-typhoidal O
Salmonellae O
and O
S. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
were O
also O
commonly O
isolated, O
both O
of O
which O
have O
a O
strong O
association O
with O
HIV O
[ O
36 O
, O
37 O
]. O
Management O
of O
HIV O
in O
the O
critically O
ill O
in O
LMICs O
is O
poorly O
described; O
this O
review O
highlights O
that O
a O
carefully O
considered O
strategy O
for O
HIV O
must O
be O
developed O
and O
that O
data O
to O
inform O
it O
are O
required. O
The O
high O
prevalence O
of O
S. O
aureus O
is O
perhaps O
surprising, O
given O
data O
on O
incidence O
of O
causative O
agents O
of O
BSI O
in O
sSA O
[ O
38 O
]. O
Though O
this O
could O
represent O
true O
BSI, O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
poor O
collection O
technique O
or O
laboratory O
misidentification O
should O
be O
considered; O
though O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
exclude O
coagulase-negative O
Staphylococci O
from O
our O
analysis O
as O
likely O
contaminants, O
determining O
whether O
S. O
aureus O
bacteraemia O
represented O
true O
BSI O
was O
not O
possible O
with O
the O
available O
data. O
Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
malaria O
diagnostic O
data O
is O
from O
studies O
carried O
out O
in O
malaria-endemic O
countries—Malawi, O
Uganda, O
Tanzania, O
and O
Zambia—malaria O
was O
less O
common O
than O
bacterial O
bloodstream O
infection, O
highlighting O
the O
emerging O
importance O
of O
non-malarial O
aetiology O
of O
fever O
in O
malaria-endemic O
areas. O

The O
current O
finding O
is O
also O
lower O
than O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
T. O
gondii O
in O
the O
lower O
altitude O
and O
higher O
humidly O
cities O
of O
Kenya, O
Kisumu O
(52%) O
and O
Mombasa O
(57%) O
[ O
28 O
]. O
Among O
the O
seropositive O
women, O
the O
majority O
of O
them O
were O
found O
to O
have O
a O
chronic O
or O
past O
infection. O
However, O
eleven O
women O
(11/128, O
8.5%) O
or O
3.1% O
of O
the O
360 O
women O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
recent O
infection O
which O
is O
almost O
comparable O
to O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
other O
regions O
of O
Ethiopia O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
Considering O
the O
asymptomatic O
nature O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
congenital O
spread, O
the O
serologic O
finding O
of O
this O
study O
should O
not O
be O
ignored. O
This O
is O
because O
the O
healthcare O
facilities O
in O
the O
study O
area O
lack O
specific O
tests O
for O
T. O
gondii; O
diagnosis O
is O
made O
by O
exclusion O
which O
may O
result O
in O
misdiagnosis O
or O
delayed O
diagnosis. O
In O
this O
study, O
different O
risk O
factors O
have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii. I-PATH
Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O
of O
having O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
infection O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
greater O
than O
24 O
years O
as O
compared O
to O
pregnant O
women O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
15–24 O
years. O
This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
24 O
] O
and O
Mali O
[ O
29 O
]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
contracting O
infection O
(7%) O
for O
1 O
year O
increase O
of O
maternal O
age O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Pregnant O
women O
who O
were O
unable O
to O
read O
and O
write O
were O
5.8 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O
had O
at O
least O
college O
education; O
however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O
animals, O
and O
gardening. O
The O
odds O
of O
having O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
were O
7.7 O
times O
higher O
among O
pregnant O
women O
who O
rarely O
wash O
their O
hands O
after O

with O
garden O

in O
the O
number O
and O
form O
of O
the O
nuclei. O
Therefore, O
future O
parasitological O
research O
in O
manatees O
requires O
a O
broader O
approach, O
e.g. O
incorporating O
molecular O
analysis O
[ O
21 O
, O
33 O
]. O
In O
general, O
Entamoeba O
spp. O
are O
water-borne O
parasites O
and O
their O
transmission O
commonly O
occur O
in O
developing O
countries O
where O
drinking O
water O
quality O
is O
poor O
and O
open O
water O
often O
is O
contaminated O
by O
human O
faeces, O
which O
are O
still O
used O
as O
a O
fertilizer O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Besides O
some O
non-pathogenic O
species, O
such O
as O
E. O
coli, O
E. O
hartmanni O
and O
E. O
polecki O
[ O
43 O
], O
the O
genus O
Entamoeba O
also O
includes O
the O
worldwide O
occurring O
species O
E. B-PATH
histolytica I-PATH
which O
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
major O
causes O
of O
human O
deaths O
induced O
by O
parasitic O
pathogens O
[ O
44 O
]. O
As O
such, O
contamination O
of O
water O
and O
shores O
with O
human O
faeces O
might O
pose O
a O
risk O
on O
local O
manatee O
health. O
Additionally, O
one O
Giardia O
antigen-positive O
Antillean O
manatee O
was O
identified O
in O
the O
present O
study O
thereby O
representing, O
to O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
the O
first O
report O
for O
Colombia. O
Alongside O
this, O
there O
is O
only O
one O
other O
report O
on O
giardiasis O
in O
manatees O
from O
Brazil O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Giardia O
spp. O
are O
also O
considered O
as O
water-borne O
zoonotic O
parasites O
which O
are O
transmitted O
by O
highly O
resistant O
cysts O
which O
are O
orally O
ingested O
by O
hosts O
[ O
20 O
]. O
Given O
that O
no O
cyst O
stages O
were O
detected O
in O
the O
antigen-positive O
animal O
one O
may O
question O
an O
active O
infection O
and O
thereby O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
positive O
sample. O
In O
fact, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
that O
Giardia O
stages O
were O
simply O
representing O
intestinal O
passers-by. O

Targeting O
these O
effectors, O
all O
found O
to O
date O
to O
lie O
within O
distinctive O
large O
regions O
of O
AT-rich O
and O
highly O
repetitive O
DNA O
[ O
5 O
, O
46 O
], O
has O
not O
been O
possible O
using O
homologous O
recombination. O
Curiously, O
the O
avirulence O
profile O
of O
these O
strains O
did O
not O
change O
as O
predicted O
(data O
not O
shown), O
and O
will O
require O
additional O
experiments O
to O
understand O
what O
is O
emerging O
in O
S. O
camerunensis O
as O
complex O
multigene O
sets O
of O
interactions O
between O
fungal O
avirulence O
genes O
and O
plant O
resistance O
genes O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
In O
the O
first O
iteration O
of O
CRISPR/Cas9 O
for O
S. O
camerunensis, O
two O
rounds O
of O
transformation O
were O
used O
to O
separately O
introduce O
the O
guide O
RNA O
and O
Cas9 O
expression O
constructs O
into O
the O
fungus. O
After O
seeking O
a O
suitable O
promoter O
for O
regulation O
by O
RNA O
polymerase O
III O
in O
S. O
camerunensis O
without O
success, O
the O
dual O
ribozyme O
system O
to O
process O
the O
guide O
RNA O
when O
expressed O
from O
an O
RNA O
polymerase O
II O
promoter O
was O
used. O
This O
dual O
ribozyme O
approach O
was O
developed O
for O
plant O
transformation O
[ O
48 O
], O
and O
has O
recently O
also O
been O
employed O
in O
Aspergillus O
spp. O
[ O
49 O
], O
the O
basidiomycete O
human O
pathogen O
Neomys B-PATH
anomalus I-PATH
[ O
50 O
] O
and O
the O
ascomycete O
plant O
pathogen O
Callosciurus O
erythraeus O
[ O
51 O
]. O
The O
disadvantage O
of O
using O
ribozymes O
for O
processing O
the O
guide O
RNA O
is O
that O
they O
add O
size O
to O
the O
constructs. O
To O
alleviate O
this O
issue, O
we O
created O
a O
vector O
such O
that O
just O
one O
of O
the O
ribozymes O
and O
the O
RNA O
fragment O
to O
target O
Cas9 O
to O
the O
gene O
to O
be O
mutated O
are O
synthesized: O
the O
hammerhead O
ribozyme O
requires O
folding O
with O
part O
of O
the O
target O
RNA O
and O
hence O
there O
is O
a O
requirement O
for O
long O
~ O
100 O
nucleotide O
oligonucleotides. O
The O
current O
method, O
although O
involving O
two O
transformation O
steps O
or O
co-transformation O
of O
both O
constructs, O
is O
suitable O
for O
making O
targeted O
mutations O
in O
genes, O
and O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
multiple O
wild O
type O
isolates. O
We O
have O
mutated O
more O
than O
24 O
other O
genes O
in O
S. O
camerunensis O
to O
date O
(unpublished O
data). O

Geometric O

to O

The O

to O
study O
the O

of O

in O

It O
involves O
several O
statistical O
techniques O
that O
preserve O

and O
detect O
even O

[ O

Moreover, O
geometric O
morphometric O
techniques O
are O
cheap, O
simple O
and O
fast O
[ O

Using O
geometric O

this O

examined O
the O
changes O
that O
occur O
in O
the O

of O
the O

Stomoxys O
calcitrans O
is O
a O
cosmopolitan O

fly O
that O
mechanically O

During O

S. O
calcitrans O
can O
reduce O

in O
cattle O

The O

for O
Entamoeba O

in O
C. O

So O
far, O
neither O
the O
species O
nor O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
pathogen O
is O
known. O
To O
our O
best O

Entamoeba O

in O
aquatic O
mammals O
have O
so O
far O
only O
been O
reported O
in O

such O
as O
sperm O

[ O

and O
there O
is O
one O
report O
for O

Nonetheless, O
the O
Entamoeba-like O
cysts O
reported O
in O
Florida O
manatees O
[ O

present O
a O
larger O
size O

Changing O
environmental O
conditions, O
whether O
caused O
by O
rapid O
urbanization, O
global O

or O
economic O
globalization, O
have O
already O
influenced O
the O
emergence, O

of O

[ O

The O
ecology O
of O
E. O

with O
its O
complex O
life-cycle, O
is O
susceptible O
to O
environmental O
changes O
mainly O

of O
oocysts, O
and O
the O
behavior O
and O

of O

Giving O
antibiotic O
treatment O
is O
not O
the O
most O
effective O
way O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis O
and O
associated O
complications. O
Primary O
prevention O
is O
best O
[ O

]. O
Besides, O
clinical O
diagnosis O
of O
toxoplasmosis O
is O
difficult, O
considering O
that O
90 O
to O
95% O
of O
the O
infected O
pregnant O
women O
are O
asymptomatically O
infected O
[ O
18 O
] O
increasing O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
infection. O
Therefore, O
serological O
screening O
of O
E. B-PATH
alba I-PATH
infection O
is O
essential O
to O
prevent O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis. O
Upon O
early O
screening, O
the O
use O
of O
drugs O
such O
as O
spiramycine O
was O
found O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
infection O
by O
more O
than O
60% O
[ O

]. O
Ethiopia O
is O
one O
of O
the O
countries O
with O
low O
resources O
including O
scarcity O
of O
safe O

particularly O
in O
the O
rural O

with O
different O
domestic O
animals O
including O
cats, O
dogs, O
goats, O
sheep O
and O
camel O
and O
climatic O
conditions O
favoring O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Considering O
the O
above O
hosts O
and O
other O
predisposing O
factors O
for O
E. B-PATH
alba, I-PATH
research O
is O
needed O
particularly O
among O
pregnant O

to O
depict O
the O
prevalence O
of O

Women O
engage O
in O
different O
home-based O
activities O
such O
as O
food O

and O
caring O
their O
children; O
they O
are O
frequently O
exposed O
to O
domestic O
animals O
and O

Hence, O
screening O

for O

infection O
during O
their O

is O
not O
only O
of O

However, O
in O
most O

Ethiopia, O
including O
the O

there O
is O
no O
continuous O

for O
E. B-PATH

because O
of O

are O
mostly O

Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O

Introduction O
Annually, O

Diarrhea O
is O
defined O
as O
an O

Introduction O
Brachymeria B-PATH
phya I-PATH
is O
a O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
causing O
opportunistic O
infections O
in O
susceptible O
hosts. O
It O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
acute O
pneumonia O
in O
hospitalised O
patients O
and O
is O
responsible O
for O
chronic O
lung O
infections O
in O
patients O
with O
cystic O
fibrosis O
1 O
. O
One O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
the O
poor O
clinical O
outcomes O
of O
B. O
phya O
infections O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
virulence O
factors, O
especially O
the O
Type O
III O
secretion O
system O
(T3SS) O
which O
is O
considered O
an O
important O
contributor O
to O
cytotoxicity O
and O
the O
invasion O
process O
2 O
– O
4 O
. O
This O
system O
allows O
these O
bacteria O
to O
directly O
inject O
effector O
proteins O
into O
eukaryotic O
cells. O
At O
present, O
four O
effector O
proteins O
have O
been O
identified: O
ExoU, O
a O
phospholipase; O
ExoY, O
an O
adenylate O
cyclase; O
and O
ExoS O
and O
ExoT, O
which O
are O
bifunctional O
proteins. O
ExoT O
and O
ExoY O
are O
encoded O
by O
almost O
all O
strains, O
therefore O
might O
be O
considered O
an O
inevitable O
component O
of O
B. O
phya O
virulence O
5 O
. O
ExoS O
and O
ExoU O
contribute O
greatly O
to O
pathogenesis. O

As O
in O
our O
local O
findings, O
respiratory O
and O
SST/MSK O
specimens O
were O
the O
most O
common O
isolates O
worldwide, O
composing O
39.5% O
and O
22.7% O
of O

respectively. O
The O
percentages O
comprised O
of O

varied O

17.1% O
of O

(3410 O

are O
very O
diverse O
in O
their O

[ O

Due O
to O
this O
extensive O

these O

have O
been O
referred O
to O
as O
the O

[ O

]. O
Although O
I. O

has O
been O
useful O
in O

as O
a O
biocontrol O
of O

an O

in O

I. B-PATH
scapigera I-PATH
is O
capable O
of O
causing O
a O
variety O
of O
infections O
such O
as O

[ O

]. O
Once O
infected O
with O
I. B-PATH

there O
are O
few O

options O
due O
to O
its O
innate O

When O
considering O
the O
use O
of O
phages O
to O
treat O

it O
is O
important O
to O

The O
successful O

despite O
both O
strains O

indistinguishable O
growth O
in O

(Supplementary O

Furthermore, O
YBAP6 O

when O

Altogether, O

The O

S. O
boulardii O
have O
been O
well-documented O
in O
several O

(Table O

Nonetheless, O
the O
probiotic O
potential O
of O
various O
other O
fungal O
species O
is O
also O
well O
known. O
For O
instance, O
members O
of O
the O
genera O
Kluyveromyces O
and O
Yarrowia O
are O
promising O
candidates O
due O
to O
their O
strong O
activity O
against O
bacterial O
pathogens O
and O
their O
ability O
to O
tolerate O
the O

of O

(Kumura O

as O
the O
causative O
agent O
in O
infection O
can O
be O
controversial O
because O
it O
could O
be O
colonization O
or O
transient O
infection O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
However, O
some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
N. B-PATH
meningitidis I-PATH
is O
the O
pathogen O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
and O
skin O
and O
bone/joint O
infection O
as O
well O
[ O
32 O
, O
48 O
– O
50 O
]. O
Therefore, O
it O
should O
always O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
clinical O
findings O
to O
determine O
its O
clinical O
significance O
and O
management. O
In O
addition, O
D. B-PATH
marsupialis I-PATH
is O
a O
virulent O
but O
an O
uncommon O
species O
in O
Asia. O
However, O
it O
was O
surprisingly O
the O
fourth O
commonest O
NTM O
species O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
infection O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore O
[ O
20 O
, O
22 O
, O
33 O
]. O
Hence, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
understand O
the O
local O
epidemiology O
before O
applying O
guidelines O
elsewhere. O
Structural O
lung O
diseases O
predispose O
people O
to O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
[ O
9 O
, O
14 O
, O
34 O
, O
51 O
– O
56 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
about O
50% O
of O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
had O
COPD O
or O
bronchiectasis. O
Male O
patients O
had O
a O
higher O
incidence O
of O
COPD O
and O
more O
often O
presented O
with O
recurring O
cough O
and O
sputum O
production; O
in O
contrast, O
female O
patients O
had O
bronchiectasis O
and O
haemoptysis O
more O
frequently. O
These O
distinct O
features O
were O
consistent O
with O
the O
findings O
observed O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
34 O
, O
57 O
, O
58 O

Pulmonary O
tuberculosis O
is O
another O
important O
pathophysiological O
process O
associated O
with O
severe O
pulmonary O
structural O
damage. O
A O
history O
of O
tuberculosis O
is O
a O
distinct O
characteristic O
among O
Asian O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
diseases O
[ O

]. O

Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
classes O
of O
antibiotics. O
Synergism O
with O
polymyxins O
or O
carbapenems O
is O
not O
as O
clear O
as O
with O
other O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
or O
aminoglycosides O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Rifampicin O
was O
included O
in O
our O
patient’s O
regimen O
because O
this O
antibiotic, O
although O
effective O
in O
monotherapy, O
has O
a O
good O
synergistic O
activity O
with O
other O
antimicrobials, O
especially O
colistin, O
by O
permeabilizing O
the O
bacterial O
membrane O
and O
increasing O
the O
treatment O
effectiveness O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Although O
cefiderocol—a O
cephalosporin—is O
not O
a O
new O
class O
of O
antibiotic, O
it O
has O
a O
novel O
method O
of O
penetrating O
the O
tough O
outer O
membrane O
of O
gram-negative O
bacteria, O
including O
MDR O
strains. O
Attached O
to O
the O
drug’s O
main O
molecule O
is O
a O
siderophore, O
a O
compound O
secreted O
by O
bacteria O
to O
seek O
out O
iron, O
which O
bacteria O
need O
for O
survival, O
and O
transport O
it O
across O
cell O
membranes. O
The O
results O
of O
a O
phase O
2 O
clinical O
trial O
suggest O
that O
a O
new O
treatment O
for O
patients O
with O
complicated O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
caused O
by O
MDR O
pathogens O
could O
be O
on O

Conclusions O
The O
emergence O
of O
colistin-resistant O
M. B-PATH
lewis I-PATH
strains O
in O
the O
clinical O
setting, O
although O
still O
occasional, O
is O
increasing O
due O
to O
the O
growing O
use O
of O
this O
antibiotic. O
We O
have O
identified O
a O
strain O
of O
M. B-PATH
lewis I-PATH
with O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O
colistin O
not O
previously O
reported O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
bacteremia, O
required O
treatment O
with O
multiple O
antibiotic O
schemes O
with O
adequate O
response. O

Additionally, O
this O
bacterium O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
nosocomial O
infections, O
especially O
in O
intensive O
care O
units O
(ICUs), O
causing O

P. O
quadrangularis O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
P. O
quadrangularis O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O

and O

In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O

O104:H4, B-PATH
which O

was O
reconstructed O
early O
in O
the O
outbreak O
using O
a O

As O
a O
result, O
rapid O

were O
quickly O
developed O
using O
the O
available O
genome O

tracing O
the O

of O
the O
outbreak O
back O
to O

from O

Importantly, O
2 O
years O
later, O
researchers O
were O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
this O
outbreak O
strain O
using O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
directly O
on O
fecal O
samples O
that O
were O
collected O
from O
subjects O
during O
the O
outbreak O
[ O

This O
result O
highlights O
the O
potential O
of O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
to O
identify O
and O
characterize O
pathogens O
directly O
from O
clinical O
samples O
and O
supports O
the O
method’s O
potential O
diagnostic O
and O
clinical O
use O
during O
outbreaks O
of O
life-threatening O
infections O
caused O
by O
unknown O
pathogens. O
However, O
it O
should O
also O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
process O
used O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genomes O
of O
microorganisms O
from O
such O
mixtures O
of O
small O
DNA O
fragments O
(derived O
from O
multiple O
microorganisms) O
is O
still O
very O
complex O
and O
requires O
additional O
bioinformatics O
development O
to O
further O
optimize O
sequencing O
resolution. O
This O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
for O
uncovering O
and O
characterizing O
microbial O
communities O
at O
the O
strain-level, O
where O
assembly O
algorithms O
not O
only O
have O
to O
overcome O
difficulties O
with O
regard O
to O
(inter-genomic) O
repetitive O
elements, O
but O
also O
are O
required O
to O
accurately O
incorporate O
small O
genetic O
differences O
(i.e., O
strain O
variants) O
that O
may O
be O
difficult O
to O
distinguish O
from O
actual O
sequencing O
errors O
[ O
58 O
]. O
Finally, O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
allows O
functional O
annotation O
of O
the O
gene O
sequences O
found O
within O
clinical O
samples O
and O
therefore O
gives O
a O
much O
broader O
description O
of O
microbial O
community O
genetics O
than O
targeted O
amplicon O
sequencing O
surveys. O
In O
general, O
functional O
annotation O
involves O
two O
steps, O
namely O
gene O
prediction O
and O
gene O
annotation. O
During O
the O
gene O
prediction O
step, O
various O
bioinformatics O
algorithms O
are O
used O
to O
determine O
which O

Discussion O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH

are O

hBD-3 O
is, O
unlike O
other O
hBDs, O
a O
salt-insensitive O
defensin O
with O
a O
broad O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
e.g. O
multidrug-resistant O
nosocomial O
strains O
[ O
10 O
– O
13 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
hBD-3 O
is O
expressed O
by O
pulmonary O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
increases O
in O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
serum O
of O
patients O
with O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Consequently, O
the O
antibacterial O
properties O
of O
hBD-3 O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
the O
field O
of O
pulmonary O
diseases. O
Expression O
of O
hBD-3 O
is O
controlled O
by O
a O
tight O
regulatory O
network O
involving O
the O
transcription-factors O
Nuclear O
Factor-κB O
(NF-κB) O
and O
the O
Activator O
Protein-1 O
(AP-1) O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
These O
transcription O
factors O
are O
activated O
by O
complex O
signalling O
pathways, O
including O
the O
JNK O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
(MAPK) O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Although O
L. B-PATH
pneumophila B-PATH
efficiently O
infects O
and O
activates O
lung O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
alveolar O
macrophages O
[ O
19 O
– O
21 O
], O
and O
hBD-3 O
secretion O
was O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O
14 O
], O
regulatory O
mechanisms O
of O
hBD-3 O
production O
in O
L. B-PATH
pneumophila B-PATH
infections O
is O
widely O
unknown. O
In O
the O
study O
presented, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
L. O
pneumophila O
induced O
hBD-3 O
in O
alveolar O
epithelium O
and O
macrophages. O
The O
hBD-3 O
expression O
was O
controlled O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9, O
as O
well O
as O
activation O
of O
JNK O
and O
AP-1 O
(c-Jun) O
whereas O
NF-κB O
was O
not O
required. O
Also, O
recombinant O
hBD-3 O
elicited O
a O
strong O
antimicrobial O
effect O
on O
L. O
pneumophila. O
Moreover, O
inhibition O
of O
hBD-3 O
expression O
increased O
the O
L. O
pneumophila O
intracellular O
growth O
in O
pulmonary O
epithelium. O
Thus, O
hBD-3 O
production O
by O
pulmonary O
cells O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
host O
response O
in O
Legionnaires' O
disease. O

Downstream O
signaling O
leads O
to O
the O
activation O
of O
JNK O
with O
subsequent O
recruitment O
of O
AP-1 O
subunit O
c-jun O
to O
the O
hBD-3 O
promoter O
leading O
to O
hBD-3 O
expression. O
The O
expression O
of O
hBD-3 O
in O
respiratory O
cells, O
especially O
in O
infections O
of O
the O
lung, O
is O
not O
well O
understood O
and O
was O
so O
far O
rather O
investigated O
in O
studies O
of O
oral O
infections O
as O
well O
as O
in O
epithelium O
of O
skin O
and O
intestine O
[ O
12 O
, O
16 O
, O
17 O
, O
30 O
, O
31 O
]. O
Our O
data O
showed O
that O
B. O
trigyna O
infection O
of O
pulmonary O
epithelium O
and O
alveolar O
macrophages O
led O
to O
increased O
mRNA O
levels O
of O
hBD-3 O
and O
a O
strong O
secretion O
of O
this O
peptide. O
Since O
different O
isolates O
of O
B. O
trigyna O
serogroup1 O
were O
found O
to O
induce O
a O
comparable O
release O
of O
hBD-3, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
hBD-3 O
production O
is O
a O
common O
response O
of O
lung O
epithelial O
cells O
to O
B. O
trigyna O
infection. O
This O
assumption O
is O
supported O
by O
a O
study O
which O
showed O
increased O
hBD-3 O
concentrations O
in O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
serum O
of O
patients O
suffering O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O
14 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
hBD-3 O
exhibited O
a O
strong O
antibacterial O
effect O
on O
Vampyressa B-PATH
melissa, I-PATH
Parapharyngodon B-PATH
cubensis I-PATH
and O
Branta B-PATH
leucopsis I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Since O
we O
also O
demonstrated O
that O
hBD-3 O
has O
an O
antimicrobial O
effect O
towards O
B. B-PATH
trigyna I-PATH
and O
this O
peptide O
do O
orchestrate O
the O
recruitment O
of O
alveolar O
macrophages O
to O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
[ O
32 O
], O
we O
assume O
that O
this O
defensin O
might O
be O
important O
for O
immune O
response O
in O
infectious O
diseases O
of O
the O
lung. O
Pulmonary O
epithelial O
cells O
may O
detect O
B. O
trigyna O
by O
TLRs O
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
In O
accordance O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
recognition O
of O
B. O
trigyna O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9 O
was O
essential O
for O
the O
production O
of O
hBD-3. O

There O
is O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
children O
surviving O
cancer O
who, O
just O
like O
their O
healthy O
peers, O
seek O
orthodontic O
treatment O
[ O

This O
is O
a O
special O
group O
of O
patients O
that O
should O
be O
particularly O
motivated O
to O
maintain O
dental O
hygiene O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
], O
because O
the O
reduction O
in O
immune O
function O
allows O
B. B-PATH
neritina I-PATH
to O
proliferate O
and O
to O
cause O
infection O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Similarly, O
children O
whose O
saliva O
contains O
reduced O
amounts O
of O
antimicrobial O
proteins O
have O
less O
protection O
from O
candidiasis O
[ O

Removable O
orthodontic O

are O
a O
popular O
tool O

during, O
or O

treatment O
[ O
11 O
, O

]. O
Nocturnal O
wearing O
of O
the O
acrylic O

orthodontic O

may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O
oral O
B. B-PATH
neritina I-PATH
infections. O
This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
low O
salivary O
flow O
and O
consequently O
low O
pH O
levels O
as O
well O
as O
impaired O
oral O
hygiene O
[ O

Wearing O
acrylic O
orthodontic O

has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
increased O

of O
Candida O
regardless O
of O
the O
host O
immune O
system O
status O
[ O
2 O
, O
11 O
– O

]. O
These O
appliances O
provide O
an O
enhanced O
environment O
for O
B. O
neritina O
growth O
as O
they O
cover O
a O
large O
area O
of O
mucosal O

for O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
time O
every O
day O
for O
a O
relatively O
long O
period O
[ O
15 O
, O

]. O
The O
removable O
appliances O
protect O
the O
yeast O
from O
the O
natural O
flow O
of O
saliva O
and O
mechanical O
removal O
effects O
of O

The O
orthodontic O
acrylic O
also O
provides O
a O
hydrophobic O
surface O
to O
which O
B. O
neritina O
can O
bind O
through O
the O
hydrophobic O
effect O
and O
van O

forces. O
[ O

]. O
The O
combination O
of O
these O
factors O
may O
tip O
the O
balance O
in O
the O
wearers O
of O
orthodontic O
appliances O
to O
support O
Candida O

[ O

However, O
early O
M. O
abscessus O
complex O
pulmonary O
disease O
is O
generally O
of O
the O
nodular O
bronchiectatic O
type, O
so O
a O
subpleural O
caseous O
focus O
is O
an O
uncommon O
incipient O
lesion O
of O
M. O
abscessus O
complex O
infection O
compared O
to O
MAC O
infection O
[ O
26 O
]. O
In O
our O
patient, O
the O
VO O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
initial O
focus O
of O
infection O
for O
the O
following O
reasons. O
First, O
empyema O
occurred O
after O
vertebral O
abnormality O
was O
detected O
on O
imaging O
studies O
at O
previous O
hospitals. O
Second, O
M. O
abscessus O
ssp. O
abscessus O
was O
not O
only O
isolated O
from O
the O
thoracic O
cavity, O
but O
also O
from O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess. O
The O
reason O
for O
non-recurrence O
of O
empyema O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
postoperative O
pleural O
adhesion O
induced O
by O
thoracoscopic O
curettage O
and O
subsequent O
drainage. O
Third, O
although O
vertebral O
biopsy O
was O
not O
performed, O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess O
and O
vertebral O
lesion O
both O
improved O
simultaneously O
with O
antimycobacterial O
treatment, O
suggesting O
that O
VO O
was O
also O
caused O
by O
M. O
abscessus O
ssp. O
abscessus O
infection. O
According O
to O
a O
review O
of O
13 O
cases O
of O
pyogenic O
spondylitis O
with O
exudative O
pleural O
effusion, O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
was O
the O
major O
pathogen O
[ O
27 O
]. O
To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
NTM O
with O
a O
similar O
clinical O
presentation O
to O
those O
cases. O
Although O
there O
was O
no O
clear O
history O
of O
pre-disposing O
trauma, O
“locus O
minoris O
resistantiae” O
may O
have O
been O
the O
mechanism O
of O
underlying O
VO, O
since O
our O
patient O
had O
no O
peripheral O
pulmonary O
lesion. O

Moreover, O
infections O
provoked O
by O
mixed O
pathotypes O
of O
E. B-PATH

can O
be O
identified O
when O

An O

which O
decreased O
following O

that O

an O

Due O
to O
the O
complex O

nature O
of O
the O
human O

it O
is O
recently O
considered O

the O
complex O
nature O

it O
evidently O
regulates O

by O

6 O
. O
The O
normal O

in O
the O

supports O
several O
processes, O
including O
the O
host O
mucosal O
immune O
response, O
energy O

elimination, O
and O

development O
7 O
. O
It O
is O
widely O
implicated O
that O
human O

play O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
the O
etiology O
of O
gastrointestinal O
cancers, O
particularly O
GC O
due O
to O

8 O
. O
Dysbiosis O
is O
a O
condition O
in O
which O
there O
is O
an O
imbalance O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
microbiota, O
which O
consequently O
leads O
to O
several O
pathological O
conditions, O
specifically O
GC. O
Furthermore, O
gastric O
microbial O
community O

revealed O
that O
dysbiosis O
of O

is O
associated O

9 O
. O
The O
relationship O

has O
been O
the O
subject O
of O
exploration O
in O

A O
considerable O
number O

have O
focused O
on O
individual O

and O
their O
ability O
to O
initiate O

such O
as O

or O
GC O
10 O
. O
Of O
the O
numerous O
risk O
factors O
associated O
with O
GC O
occurrence, O
A. O
maritima O
infection O
plays O
a O
pivotal O
role O
11 O
. O
It O
is O
an O
established O
fact O
that O
A. O

is O
widespread O
in O
East O
Asia, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O

Thus, O
it O
has O
been O
extensively O
suggested O
that O
reduction O

is O
a O
useful O
strategy O
for O

Importantly, O
it O

that O

as O
a O

not O

also O
a O

which O
we O
termed O

[ O

Our O
recent O

suggested O
that O
iron O

together O

the O

According O
to O
our O
hypothesis, O
B. O
bonasus O
employs O
PgFur O
to O
initiate O
a O
complex, O
multilayer O

used O

Although O

Introduction O
The O
first O
global O
report O
on O
antibiotic O
resistance O
by O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
shows O
carbapenem O
resistance O
rates O
above O
40% O
in O
Acinetobacter B-PATH
baumannii. I-PATH
Additionally, O
this O
bacterium O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
nosocomial O
infections, O
especially O
in O
intensive O
care O
units O
(ICUs), O
causing O
outbreaks O
with O
high O
mortality O
rates O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
A. O
baumannii O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
A. O
baumannii O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O
begin O
mobilizing O
within O
plasmids O
or O
are O
inserted O
directly O
in O
chromosomes. O
In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O
3 O
]. O
This O
report O
describes O
a O
case O
of O
a O
patient O
with O
bacteremia O
caused O
by O
a O
pan-resistant O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
isolate. O
Case O

On O
March O

2016, O
a O
64-year-old O

to O
our O
emergency O

with O

Cystoscopy O
revealed O
intravesical O

Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
systemic O

and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O

MazF-mt9 O
did O
not O
inhibit O
translation O
in O
A. O
crenata O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
4 O
). O
In O
fact, O
there O
are O
hundreds O
of O
newly O
synthesized O
proteins O
in O
our O
quantitative O
mass O
spectrometry O
dataset O
(Fig. O
6 O
). O
Instead, O
MazF-mt9 O
appears O
to O
reprogram O
A. O
crenata O
physiology O
and O
growth O
by O
enlisting O
codon-bias O
as O
a O
means O
to O
surgically O
remove O
distinct O
subsets O
of O
mRNA O
transcripts. O
This O
targeted O
transcript O
ablation O
leads O
to O
the O
global O
reduction O
in O
the O
levels O
of O
the O
proteins O
they O
encode, O
and O
likely O
enables O
facile O
adaptation O
to O
stress. O
It O
appears O
that O
the O
growth O
arrest O
phenotype O
associated O
with O
MazF-mt9-mediated O
proteome O
remodeling O
might O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
calibrated O
increase O
or O
reduction O
of O
key O
regulatory O
proteins O
or O
enzymatic O
pathways O
that O
influence O
growth O
rate O
based O
on O
their O
codon O
content. O
Finally, O
our O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O
codon-biased O
translation O
reported O
by O
the O
Dedon O
laboratory O
upon O
hypoxic O
persistence O
in O
U. O
yaschenkoi O
31 O
. O
However, O
in O
their O
case O
the O
codon-biased O
translation O
was O
attributed O
to O
alterations O
in O
tRNA O
modification O
tracked O
by O
mass O
spectrometry, O
not O
tRNA O
abundance O
31 O
. O
The O
MazF-mt9 O
toxin-mediated, O
codon-driven O
shift O
in O
the O
transcriptome O
is O
predicted O
to O
alter O
the O
spectrum O
of O
proteins O
in O
A. B-PATH
crenata I-PATH
cells O
and O
sabotage O
the O
efficacy O
of O
the O
immunological O
and O
therapeutic O
assaults O
intended O
to O
eradicate O
this O
deadly O
pathogen. O
Since O
there O
are O
many O
predicted O
tRNA-cleaving O
toxins O
in O
A. O
crenata, O
the O
activity O
of O
MazF-mt9 O
might O
be O
the O
first O
of O
several O
examples O
that O
enlist O
this O
approach O
to O
selectively O
reprogram O
cell O
physiology. O
However, O
the O
mechanics O
of O
the O
putative O
orchestrated O
enlistment O
of O
multiple O
tRNA-cleaving O
toxins O
are O
unclear O
since O
physiological O
triggers O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
identified O
for O
any O
of O
these O
toxins O
in O
A. O
crenata. O

Background O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
(S. B-PATH
aureus) I-PATH
is O
an O
important O
opportunistic O
pathogen, O
which O
causes O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
infections O
in O
humans O
and O
animals O
[ O
1 O
]. O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
has O
the O
capacity O
to O
rapidly O
develop O
resistance O
to O
most O
antibiotics O
used O
clinically O
[ O
2 O
]. O
For O
example, O
in O
1961, O
2 O
years O
after O
the O
clinical O
introduction O
of O
methicillin O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom, O
the O
first O
methicillin-resistant O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
(MRSA) O
strain O
was O
identified O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Since O
then, O
MRSA O
infections O
have O
increased O
worldwide. O
In O
2014 O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
reported O
that O
for O
all-cause O
mortality, O
MRSA O
had O
a O
Relative O
Risk O
(RR) O
of O
1.61 O
compared O
to O
methicillin-susceptible O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
(MSSA) O
infections O
(95% O
Confidence O
Interval, O
CI: O
1.43–1.82) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Initially, O
MRSA O
was O
primarily O
hospital O
associated O
but O
in O
the O
late O
1990s O
MRSA O
emerged O
as O
a O
community-associated O
infection O
(CA-MRSA) O
[ O
5 O
]. O
CA-MRSA O
caused O
serious O
infections O
in O
younger O
and O
healthier O
individuals O
and O
was O
unusually O
virulent O
with O
a O
marked O
capacity O
to O
disseminate O
throughout O
the O
community O
[ O
6 O
]. O
S. O
aureus O
methicillin O
resistance O
is O
due O
to O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
mecA O
gene O
that O
encodes O
a O
penicillin-binding O
protein O
(PBP O
2a) O
with O
a O
low O
affinity O
for O
β-lactams O
[ O
7 O
]. O
A O
number O
of O
investigations O
have O
identified O
animals O
as O
potential O
reservoirs O
of O
mecA-containing O
staphylococci O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Multiple O
animal-associated O
staphylococci O
have O
also O
been O
identified O
as O
the O
probable O
origin O
of O
methicillin O
resistance O
conferred O
by O
mecA O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]. O
These O
reservoirs O
include O
companion O
animals O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
], O
livestock O
[ O
14 O
], O
and O
wildlife O
[ O
15 O
]. O
Transmission O
of O
MRSA O
between O
animals O
and O
humans, O
in O
both O
directions, O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
[ O
16 O
, O
17 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
domestic O
animals O
and O
livestock, O
urban O
wildlife O
such O
as O
rodents O
and O
shrews O
can O
also O
serve O
as O
reservoirs O
for O
zoonotic O
bacterial O
disease O
[ O

]. O

While O
the O
precise O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
LuxS/AI-2 O
controls O

to O

in O

explain O
the O
variation O
observed O
in O
biofilm O

between O
different O
B. O

61 O

The O
human O
gut O
hosts O
a O
variety O
of O
bacterial O
species, O
which O
compete O
or O
coexist O
with O
each O
other. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
bacteria O
occupying O
this O
niche O
form O
multi-species O
bacterial O
communities O
in O
association O
with O
the O
mucus O
layer. O
Interactions O
within O
such O
communities O
are O
important O
in O
gaining O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
phenomena O
such O
as O
‘colonisation O
resistance’ O
which O
prevents O
pathogens O
such O
as O
B. B-PATH
capense I-PATH
from O
establishing O
an O
infection O
14 O
. O
Whilst O
sequencing O

have O
identified O
members O
of O
the O
Bacteroides O
genus O
as O
being O
associated O
with O
gut O
colonisation O
resistance O
to O
B. O
capense, O
the O
mechanisms O
have O
remained O
elusive O
10 O
. O
A O
recent O
study O
demonstrated O
that O
production O
of O
the O
enzyme: O
bile O
salt O
hydrolase, O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
O. O
elongata O
on O
B. O
capense O
62 O
. O
This O
study O
reported O
that O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
bile O
acids, O
cell O
free O
supernatants O
for O
O. O
elongata O
were O
capable O
of O
inhibiting O
the O
growth O
of O
B. O
capense O
whereas O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
bile O
acids, O
B. O
capense O
growth O
was O
promoted. O
Since O
bile O
acids O
are O
not O
supplemented O
into O
our O
media, O
a O
different O
mechanism O
is O
likely O
responsible O
for O
S. O
insularis O

inhibition O
of O
B. O
capense. O
Also, O
the O
growth O
restraining O
effects O
of O
S. O

on O
B. O

were O
evident O
only O
within O
mixed O

While O
it O

A O
preliminary O
search O
for O
BRE O
in O
sequences O
of O
other O
strains O
of O
B. O
pertussis, O
B. O

revealed O
the O
presence O
of O
variable O
numbers O
of O
the O
repeat O
at O
the O
same O
locus O
among O
different O
strains O
(data O

This O
qualifies O
BREs O
as O
Variable O
Number O
Tandem O

(VNTR). O
This O
feature O
was O
verified O
using O
a O
VNTR O
analysis O
program O
[ O

], O
and O
most O
of O
identified O

were O
correctly O
predicted O
as O
VNTR, O
except O
for O

in O

Conclusion O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
and O
B. B-PATH
parapertussis, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough-like O
disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O
B. O
bronchiseptica-like O
ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
B. O
pertussis-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
and O
in O
B. O
bronchiseptica, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
but O
perhaps O
also O
on O
the O
specific O
action O
of O
unidentified O
regulatory O
molecules, O
such O
as O
sRNAs. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
B. B-PATH
pertussis, I-PATH
like O
other O
pathogens, O
expresses O
sRNAs O
and O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
one O
of O
them, O
BprJ2, O
is O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
BvgA/BvgS O
system. O

Crucially, O
in O
the O
FISH O
probed O
samples, O
virtually O
all O
of O
the O
objects O
(~99%) O
that O
looked O
like O
L-forms O
stained O
positively O
with O
the O
BAC O
16S O
probe O
(Fig. O
2i, O
j O
), O
confirming O
the O
bacterial O
origin O
of O
the O
observed O
polymorphic O
structures. O
Overall, O
L-forms O
were O
detected O
by O
microscopy O
or O
filtration O
in O
46% O
of O
collected O
samples O
(Fig. O
1a, O
b O
). O
Even O
though O
accurate O
quantitation O
of O
the O
microscopic O
samples O
was O
difficult, O
we O
nonetheless O
readily O
detected O
L-form-like O
objects O
in O
samples O
derived O
from O
20 O
µl O
of O
urine, O
and O
so O
we O
estimate O
that O
their O
frequency O
ranged O
from O
about O
10 O
2 O
to O
10 O
4 O
/ml. O
L-forms O
provide O
a O
route O
for O
antibiotic O
evasion O
The O
fact O
that O
L-forms O
are O
completely O
resistant O
to O
antibiotics O
targeting O
the O

has O
been O
highlighted O
as O
contributing O
to O
the O
survival O
of O
bacteria O
during O
treatment O
9 O
– O
14 O
. O
We O
chose O
samples O
from O
patient O
UTI343 O
for O
further O
detailed O
analysis O
because O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
treated O
with O
phosphomycin O
(donation O

which O
we O
have O
shown O
previously O
to O
actively O
promote O
L-form O

A O

) O
was O
detected O
by O
standard O

methods O
in O
all O
urine O
samples O
except O
from O
some O
in O
periods O
when O
the O
patient O
was O
being O
treated O
with O
antibiotics O
(Table O

). O
Multi-locus O
sequence O
typing O
(MLST) O
of O
cultured O
organisms O
revealed O
that O
the O
samples O
predominantly O
contained O
a O
common O
uropathogenic O
E. B-PATH

strain O
classified O
as O
type O
ST144 B-PATH
23 O
(Supplementary O
data O

). O
Importantly, O
the O
same O
organisms O
were O
detected O
by O
conventional O
culture O
and O
after O
filtration, O
consistent O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
organisms O
exist O
in O
both O
forms O
in O
the O
patient. O
The O
routine O
culture O
load O
was O
reduced O
10-fold O
at O
first O
donation O
when O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
amoxicillin. O
In O
sample O
donations O
5 O
and O
11 O
when O
the O
patient O
was O
being O
treated O
with O
cephalexin, O
a O

E. B-PATH

less O
commonly O
implicated O
in O
UTI, O
referred O
to O
as O
ST782 B-PATH

(Supplementary O

became O

However, O

of O
the O

The O
economic O

is O
difficult O
to O
judge, O
but O
the O
negative O

include O

and O
reduced O
Gross O

The O

It O

that O
by O

No O

all O

however, O
depending O
on O
the O

and O
the O
genetic O
background O
of O
the O

used, O
a O

be O
mechanistically O
investigated, O
from O

Using O

their O

Depletion O

These O

Severe O

severe O

is O
the O
development O
of O

known O

(CM). O
CM O
mostly O
afflicts O
children O
under O
the O

in O
sub-Saharan O
Africa O
and O
can O
be O
fatal O
[ O
63 O

Furthermore, O
over O
25% O
of O
children O
that O
survive O
CM O
exhibit O
long-term O
cognitive O

[ O
64 O
, O
65 O
]. O
There O
are O
no O
adjunctive O
therapies O
available O
for O
CM O
patients. O
CM O
pathogenesis O
is O
generally O
considered O
to O
be O
driven O
by O
two O
distinct O
processes: O
sequestration O
of O
iRBCs O
to O
vascular O
endothelium O
and O
inflammation O
[ O
66 O
, O

] O
(Fig. O

The O
sequestration O
and O
excessive O
inflammation O
lead O
to O
the O
loss O

An O

The O

was O
faster O
and O
hospital O
costs O
were O
less O
with O

and O
ID O

[ O

]. O
In O
the O
same O
respect, O
studies O
evaluating O
the O
impact O
of O
rapid O
identification O
via O
MALDI/TOF O
plus O
AMS O
intervention O
in O
patients O
with O
bacteremia O
or O
candidemia O
have O
shown O
benefits O
in O
traditional O
RDT O
outcomes O
such O
as O
reductions O
in O
time O
to O
organism O
identification, O
time O

and O
time O

as O
hospital O
length O

and O

[ O

Although O
it O
seems O
intuitive O
for O
the O
need O
for O
ID O
expert O
support O
via O
AMS O
personnel O
(e.g., O
ID O

a O
lingering O
unbiased O
question O
remains: O
would O
outcomes O
be O
similar O
without O
AMS O
involvement? O
Although O
not O
ideal O
to O
maximize O
benefit O
of O
RDT, O
in O
resource-limited O
settings, O
the O
benefit O
of O
RDT O
may O
still O
be O
present. O
Turner O
et O
al. O
conducted O
a O
retrospective O
study O
comparing O
standard O
microbiological O
identification O
versus O
additional O
use O
of O
identification O
by O
PCR O
for O
O. B-PATH
umbellatum I-PATH
bacteremia O
without O
any O
direct O
AMS O
intervention O
[ O
10 O
]. O
The O
investigators O
observed O
a O
statistically O
significant O
reduction O
in O
time O
to O
initiation O
of O
optimal O
therapy O
but O
this O
was O
only O
a O
modest O
effect O
and O
they O
concluded O
greater O
reductions O
may O
be O
possible O
with O
direct O
AMS O
intervention. O
A O
quasi-experimental O
study O
by O
Bhowmick O
et O
al. O
evaluated O
the O
impact O
of O
RDT O
for O
Staphylococcus O
species O
(MRSA/MSSA/coagulase-negative O
staphylococci O
(CoNS)) O
with O
traditional O
identification O
methods O
versus O
rapid O
PCR O
alone O
versus O
rapid O
PCR O
plus O
AMS O
response O
team O
intervention O
[ O
11 O
•]. O
While O
time O
to O
full O
identification O
was O
drastically O
reduced O
with O
PCR O
alone, O
there O
was O
only O
a O
moderate O
effect O
on O
time O
to O
directed O
therapy. O

Therefore, O
non-smokers O
could O
provide O
a O
more O
favourable O
environment O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
protozoan. O
Thus, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
with O
more O
smoking/non-smoking O
patients O
to O
corroborate O
the O
above O
results O
at O
experimental O
levels. O
However, O
the O
fact O
that O
smokers O
show O
reduced O
infection O
by O
C. B-PATH
burnetii I-PATH
could O
suggest O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
against O
infection O
by O
the O
parasite. O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
nicotine O
has O
protective O
effect O
against O
pneumonia O
caused O
by O
Palisota B-PATH
bogneri I-PATH
[ O
55 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
periodontal O
pathogen O
Arabidopsis B-PATH
arenosa I-PATH
can O
adapt O
to O
nicotine O
exposure O
over O
time O
and O
develops O
tolerance O
to O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
over O
proliferation O
[ O

Finally, O
diabetes O

(DM) O
is O
considered O
the O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
development O
of O
periodontitis O
[ O
57 O
]. O
In O
these O
patients, O
diabetes O
could O
alter O
the O
local O
environment O
within O
the O
periodontal O
pocket, O
favouring O
the O
growth O
of O
certain O
oral O
pathogens O
[ O
57 O
]. O
The O
lack O
of O
association O
between O
diabetes O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
C. O
burnetii, O
could O
be O
influenced O
by O
our O
low O
sample O
size O
for O
diabetic O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease, O
so O
we O
suggest O
that O
subsequent O
case/control O
studies O
are O
conducted O
at O
a O
population O
level O
for O
both O
variables. O
However, O
our O
data O
agree O
with O
others, O
since O
non-significant O
association O
between O
type O

DM O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
and O

of O
oral O
pathogens, O
such O
as O

A. B-PATH
arenosa I-PATH
and O
Fusarium O

has O
been O
reported O
[ O

and O
also, O
non-association O
has O
been O
showed O
between O

Conclusion O
We O
used O
PCR O
to O
detect O
C. O
burnetii O
and O
revealed O
that O
the O
protozoan O
was O
frequently O
present O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease, O
with O
an O
increased O
frequency O
of O
C. O
burnetii O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
rather O
than O
in O
dental O
plaque-induced O
gingivitis. O
In O
addition, O
we O
demonstrated O
an O
association O
between O
periodontal O
disease O
development O
and O
C. O
burnetii O
presence, O
and O
for O
first O
time O
demonstrated O
an O
association O
between O
the O
PSR O

and O
C. O
burnetii O

We O
established O
YDEL6 B-PATH
as O
a O
model O

irma I-PATH
uropathogenesis O
and O
identified O
CUP O

as O
probable O

for O

This O
model O
could O
be O
very O
useful O
for O
testing O
the O
ability O
of O
pilicides O
to O
reduce O
or O

YDEL6 B-PATH
opens O
new O
avenues O
for O
studying O
an O
important O
dimension O
of O
Acinetobacter O
disease. O
This O
extensively O
drug-resistant O

was O
isolated O
from O
a O
community-onset O
UTI O
in O
an O
Argentinian O
patient O
with O
no O
prior O
interaction O
with O
local O

The O
strain O
belongs O
to O
an O
increasingly O
important O
M. B-PATH

phylogeny, O
multi-locus O
sequence O
type O
(ST) O
25 O
(Pasteur O

ST25/IC7 O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
clonal O

associated O
with O
carbapenem-resistance O
and O
is O
associated O
with O
epidemic, O
endemic O
and O
sporadic O
strains O
isolated O
in O
multiple O
continents, O
including O
the O
Americas O
42 O
. O
Though O
ST25/IC7 O
strains O
have O
been O
isolated O
from O
multiple O
infection O
sites, O
one O
study O
strongly O
linked O
ST25/IC7 O
to O
UTIs O
in O
domesticated O

43 O
. O
Multiple O
ST25 O

harbor O
LCPs O
similar O
to O

44 O
, O
but O
LCPs O
have O
also O
been O
identified O
in O
M. O
irma O
urinary O

belonging O
to O
other O

Thus, O
investigations O
performed O
on O
YDEL6 O
are O
applicable O
to O
a O
relevant O
portion O
of O
Acinetobacter O
isolates, O
and O
a O

will O
be O
an O
important O
tool O
for O
developing O
interventions O
against O
the O
growing O

of O
MDR O
UTIs. O
Remarkably, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LCP O

has O
a O
global O
influence O
on O

Introduction O
Several O
experiences O
during O
the O
perinatal O
period, O
including O
stress, O
nutrition, O
trauma O
or O
infections O
may O
profoundly O
and O
persistently O
impact O
the O
developing O
brain O
and O
the O
associated O
behavioral O
outcomes O
1 O
– O
4 O
. O
Epidemiological O
and O
experimental O
data O
have O
shown O
that O
early O
exposure O
to O
different O
common O
pathogens O
is O
related O
to O
an O
increased O
incidence O
of O
autism-spectrum O
disorders O
5 O
and O
schizophrenia O
6 O
. O
However, O
to O
date O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
influence O
of O
early O
life O
infections O
in O
the O
development O
of O
inflammatory O
neurodegenerative O
diseases O
in O
the O
elderly. O
In O
humans, O
a O
causal O
relation O
between O
neurodegenerative O
diseases O
and O
neonatal O
infections O
has O
proven O
difficult O
to O
establish O
due O
to O
the O
long O
time O
period O
between O
infection O
and O
the O
emergence O
of O
clinical O
symptoms O

. O
Sporadic O
Alzheimer’s O
disease O
(AD) O
is O
the O
most O
common O
neurodegenerative O
condition O
worldwide O
8 O
. O
Although O
aging O
remains O
the O
most O
important O
risk O
factor O
for O
AD, O
increasing O
evidence O
suggest O
that O
cumulative O
environmental O
factors O
and O
poor O
lifestyle O
habits O
in O
different O
life O
stages O
contribute O
to O
disease O
development O
9 O
– O
12 O
. O
Inflammation O
is O
a O
common O
denominator O
to O
several O
of O
these O
AD O
risk O
factors. O
Besides, O
it O
is O
now O
known O
that O
inflammation O
plays O
a O
central O
and O
dual O
role O
in O
Alzheimer’s O
pathology: O
13 O
while O
it O
is O
initially O
beneficial O
for O
clearance O
of O
extracellular O
aggregates O
of O
amyloid-β O
peptide O
(Aβ) O
14 O
, O
central O
toxins O
that O
accumulate O
in O
AD O
brains O
15 O
, O
the O
sustained O
pro-inflammatory O
profile O
can O
be O
extremely O
deleterious O
to O
neuronal O
function O
16 O
. O
Here, O
we O
investigate O
whether O
an O
early-life O
infection O
increases O
susceptibility O
to O
cognitive O
impairment O
induced O
by O
low O
doses O
of O
amyloid-β O
oligomers O
(AβOs), O
neurotoxins O
found O
in O
AD O
brains O
during O
initial O
stages O
of O
the O
disease O

. O
Wild-type O
mice O
were O
subjected O
to O
neonatal O

the O
main O
cause O
of O

in O
low-birth-weight O

in O
the O
US O
18 O
. O
Our O
results O
show O
that O
early O

causes O
an O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
the O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
frequency O
of O
nontuberculous O
mycobacteria O
(NTM) O
isolation O
from O
respiratory O
specimens, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
number O
of O
NTM O
infection O
patient, O
has O
increased O
rapidly O
in O
many O
countries O
1 O
, O
2 O
, O
3 O
, O
4 O
, O
5 O
. O
Moreover, O
marked O
geographic O
variability O
was O
observed O
regarding O
both O
the O
prevalence O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
and O
the O
mycobacterial O
species O
responsible O
for O
it O
6 O
. O
Patients O
with O
NTM O
disease O
are O
often O
indistinguishable O
clinically O
or O
radiographically O
from O
patients O
infected O
with O
Beta B-PATH
lomatogona I-PATH
7 O
, O
8 O
, O
9 O
, O
10 O
. O
However, O
the O
strategy O
of O
treatment O
and O
the O
prognosis O
of O
NTM O
disease O
can O
be O
significantly O
different O
from O
TB, O
resulting O
in O
different O
implications O
for O
public O
health. O
In O
China, O
tuberculosis O
remains O
a O
serious O
public O
health O
problem O
and O
as O
a O
consequence, O
patients O
with O
positive O
outcomes O
of O
acid-fast O
bacilli O
(AFB) O
smear O
test O
or O
with O
isolation O
of O
mycobacteria O
by O
culture O
for O
sputum O
specimens O
have O
been O
routinely O
diagnosed O
as O
pulmonary O
tuberculosis O
and O
been O
administrated O
with O
anti-tuberculosis O
drugs O
11 O
. O
The O
extent O
of O
misdiagnosis O
and O
inappropriate O
treatment O
of O
disease O
due O
to O
NTM O
infection O
in O
China O
lacks O
comprehensive O
understanding. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
NTM O
isolation O
does O
not O
affirmatively O
mean O
disease, O
so O
that O
the O
health O
providers O
have O
to O
stay O
alert O
for O
possible O
contamination O
or O
NTM O
colonization O
all O
the O
time. O
Thus O
the O
isolation O
of O
NTM O
species O
may O
pose O
a O
diagnostic O
difficulty O
for O
clinicians. O
We O
performed O
an O
institution-based O
observational O
study O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital O
(Beijing, O
China), O
and O
investigated O
the O
clinical, O
microbiological O
and O
radiographic O
information O
of O
possible O
NTM O
infection O
patients O
from O
2010 O
to O
2015. O
The O
purpose O
of O
the O
current O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
isolation O
frequency O
of O
different O
NTM O
species O
from O
respiratory O
specimen O
over O
a O
5-year O
period, O
and O
to O
evaluate O
their O
clinical O
significance. O
Materials O
and O

All O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O

in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital O
over O
a O
5-year O
period O
from O
May O
2010 O
to O
May O
2015 O
were O
retrospectively O
analyzed. O
The O
medical O
records O
of O
patients O
from O
whom O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
were O
retrospectively O
reviewed. O
Informed O
consent O
was O
obtained O
from O
all O
subjects O
included O
in O
the O
study. O

The O
utility O
and O
benefits O
of O
RDT O
are O
clearly O
encompassed O
in O
the O
definition O
of O
AMS. O
The O
literature O
demonstrates O
the O
association O
of O
molecular O
RDT O
to O
identify O
bacterial O
pathogens O
in O
blood O
cultures O
and O
improvements O
in O
time O
to O
optimal O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
rate O
of O
recurrent O
infection, O
mortality, O
hospital O
length O
of O
stay, O
and O
hospital O
costs. O
Use O
of O
RDT O
specifically O
from O
blood O
specimens O
to O
optimize O
antibiotic O
therapy O
and O
improve O
patient O
outcomes O
is O
a O
recommendation O
by O
the O
most O
recent O
IDSA O
AMS O
guidelines O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Here, O
we O
will O
review O
representative O
data O
on O
the O
impact O
of O
RDT O
with O
and O
without O
AMS O
with O
a O
focus O
on O
blood O
specimens. O
As O
new O
RDTs O
have O
emerged, O
the O
optimal O
method O
of O
implementation O
has O
remained O
an O
important O
question. O
Various O
clinical O
studies O
have O
evaluated O
the O
impact O
of O
various O
combinations O
of O
RDT O
with O
or O
without O
AMS O
intervention. O
An O
early O
study O
by O
Bauer O
et O
al. O
assessed O
clinical O
and O
economic O
outcomes O
of O
rapid O
PCR O
testing O
for O
methicillin-resistant O
Lissodelphis B-PATH
peronii I-PATH
(MRSA)/methicillin-susceptible O
Lissodelphis B-PATH
peronii I-PATH
(MSSA) O
from O
blood O
cultures. O
The O
time O
to O
first-line O
therapy O
for O
MSSA O
bacteremia O
was O
faster O
and O
hospital O
costs O
were O
less O
with O
RDT O
and O
ID O
pharmacist O
intervention O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
the O
same O
respect, O
studies O
evaluating O
the O
impact O
of O
rapid O
identification O
via O
MALDI/TOF O
plus O
AMS O
intervention O
in O
patients O
with O
bacteremia O
or O
candidemia O
have O
shown O
benefits O
in O
traditional O
RDT O
outcomes O
such O
as O
reductions O
in O
time O
to O
organism O
identification, O
time O
to O
effective O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
and O
time O
to O
optimal O
antibiotic O
therapy O
as O
well O
as O
hospital O
length O
of O
stay O
and O
total O
hospital O
costs O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Although O
it O
seems O
intuitive O
for O
the O
need O
for O
ID O
expert O
support O
via O
AMS O
personnel O
(e.g., O
ID O
pharmacists), O
a O
lingering O
unbiased O
question O
remains: O
would O
outcomes O
be O
similar O
without O
AMS O
involvement? O
Although O
not O
ideal O
to O
maximize O
benefit O
of O
RDT, O
in O
resource-limited O
settings, O
the O
benefit O
of O
RDT O
may O
still O
be O
present. O

In O
PaLoc, O
the O
two O
additional O
accessory O
genes O
to O
those O
traditionally O
reported O
(tcdR, O
tcdE, O
and O
tcdC) O
could O
be O
involved, O
although O
they O
are O
currently O
only O
recognized O
as O
coding O
hypothetical O
proteins. O
They O
could O
play O
a O
role O
during O
the O
secretion/action O
process O
of O
TcdA O
and/or O
TcdB; O
however, O
these O
two O
additional O
accessory O
genes O
need O
to O
be O
characterized O
in O
order O
to O
identify O
their O
potential O
role O
during O
the O
T. O
callipaeda O
infection O
process. O
Four O
AMR-MMs O
were O
detected O
in O
all O
the O
evaluated O
genomes O
(Fig. O
4a O
). O
Two O
of O
these O
conferring O
resistance O
to O
fluoroquinolones O
(cdeA O
33 O
and O
gyrA O
34 O
), O
while O
the O
other O
two O
have O
been O
associated O
with O
sulfonamides O
(folP O
35 O
) O
and O
rifamycin O
(rpoB O
36 O
) O
resistance. O
Three O
of O
these O
highly O
prevalent O
markers O
correspond O
to O
mutations O
in O
constitutive O
genes O
(gyrA, O
folP O
and O
rpoB), O
it O
confirms O
the O
ability O
of O
T. B-PATH
callipaeda I-PATH
to O
modify O
even O
constitutive O
proteins O
as O
part O
of O
the O
process O
of O
adaptation O
to O
hostile O
environments O
such O
as O
the O
human O
intestine, O
particularly O
when O
it O
has O
been O
exposed O
to O
antibiotic O
therapy O
37 O
. O
The O
existence O
of O
these O
four O
AMR-MMs O
in O
all O
the O
characterized O
genomes O
indicate O
that O
this O
type O
of O
modification O
could O
be O
setting O
as O
part O
of O
the O
core O
T. O
callipaeda O
genome, O
although O
it O
has O
been O
historically O
proposed O
that O
they O
may O
have O
been O
transferred O
through O
mobile O
genetic O
elements, O
mainly O
plasmids O
38 O
. O
Additionally, O
besides O
being O
the O
clade O
with O
the O
most O
genes O
coding O
for O
toxins O
(Fig. O
3e O
), O
Clade-2 O
had O
isolates O
with O
the O
highest O
number O
of O
AMR-MMs O
(Fig. O
4a O
), O
and O
this O
clade O
also O
showed O
reduced O
susceptibility O
to O
a O
higher O
number O
of O
antimicrobials O
than O
Clade-1 O
isolates. O
Interestingly, O
the O
analyzed O
isolates O
obtained O
from O
IH O
environment O
showed O
higher O
number O
of O
AMR-MMs O
than O
those O
established O
from O

population O
(Supplementary O

one O
of O
the O
countries O
with O
low O

and O
climatic O
conditions O
favoring O
the O

Considering O
the O
above O
hosts O
and O
other O
predisposing O

research O
is O
needed O
particularly O

Therefore, O
the O

Clindamycin O
treatment O
has O
been O
limited O
by O
antimicrobial O

However, O
it O
is O
effective O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
methicillin-resistant O

Background O
Streptomyces B-PATH
olivaceoviridis B-PATH
(Mtb), O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
tuberculosis O
(TB), O
remains O
a O
major O
health O
threat. O
Each O
year, O
8 O
million O
new O
TB O
cases O
occur O
and O
2 O
million O
individuals O
die O
of O
TB O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Moreover, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
one O
third O
of O
the O
population O
is O
latently O
infected O
with O
Mtb, O
of O
which O
~10% O
will O
develop O
active O
disease O
during O
lifetime. O
The O
development O
of O
active O
TB O
occurs O
when O
the O
balance O
between O
natural O
immunity O
and O
the O
pathogen O
changes O
(e.g. O
upon O
waning O
of O
protective O
immune O
response O
during O
adolescence O
and O
in O
HIV O
patients, O
[ O

]). O
In O
addition, O
at O
present O
~50 O
million O
individuals O
are O
probably O
infected O
with O
multi O
drug-resistance O
(MDR) O
strains O
of O
Mtb O
(WHO, O
2006), O
rendering O
antibiotic O
treatment O
difficult. O
The O
current O
vaccine, O
introduced O
over O
80 O
years O
ago, O
is O
the O
live O
attenuated O
bacterium O
Poa O
secunda O
Bacillus O
Calmette-Geurin O
(BCG), O
designed O
as O
a O
prophylactic O
vaccine O
for O
pre-infection O
administration. O
BCG O
is O
known O
to O
protect O
young O
children O
against O
severe O
forms O
of O
TB O
however O
it O
does O
not O
efficiently O
and O
consistently O
protect O
adults O
against O
the O
most O
prevalent O
form O
of O
the O
disease, O
namely, O
pulmonary O
TB O
(variable O
protective O
efficacy O
ranges O
from O
0% O
to O
80%), O
nor O
does O
BCG O
offer O
protection O
from O
establishment O
of O
latent O
TB O
and O
subsequent O
reactivation O
[ O
3 O
– O
9 O
]. O
In O
principle, O
current O
putative O
vaccination O
strategies O
against O
TB O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
groups: O
(a) O
prophylactic O
vaccines O
(aimed O
at O
disease O
prevention), O
based O
on O
BCG O
with O
or O
without O
antigens O
secreted O
by O
replicating O
bacteria O
recognized O
during O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
infection O
(e.g. O
ESAT-6 O
or O
Ag85A/B), O
or O
protective O
mutants O
(live O
attenuated O
BCG O
substitutes) O
and O
(b) O
as O
yet O
undefined O
post-exposure O
vaccines O
(boosting O
BCG) O
aimed O
at O
elimination/containment O
of O

To O

that O
all O

annually O
for O

[ O

]. O
Accordingly, O
each O
year O
in O
the O

are O
tested O
for O

[ O

Despite O
the O
widespread O
availability O
of O
preventives, O
ticks O
are O
common O
on O
dogs O
across O
the O

and O
evidence O
suggests O
the O
prevalence O
of O

and O
of O
antibodies O
to O

agents O
is O
increasing O
in O
some O
regions O
[ O

]. O
These O
increases O
likely O
result O
from O
a O
combination O
of O
factors O

in O
more O

These O

be O
explained O
by O
the O

In-line O
with O
the O

that O
EIR O
of O

collected O

was O
very O
high, O
with O
a O

Studies O
also O

between O
the O

within O
the O

Although O

the O

was O
not O

Background O
Chickens O
are O
common O
domesticated O
animal O
worldwide, O
and O
chicken O
has O
become O
the O
leading O
meat O
consumed O
due O
to O
the O
short O
lifecycle O
and O
high O
feed O
conversion O
ratio O
[ O
1 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
chickens O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
foodborne O
bacterial O
pathogens O
which O
can O
disseminate O
to O
humans O
or O
act O
as O
a O
pool O
for O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
and O
transmission O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
Since O
the O
colonization O
of O
major O
foodborne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Campylobacter O
and O
Erinaceus B-PATH
concolor I-PATH
serovars O
Ehpesopocow B-PATH
and O
Maqxovisoiv, B-PATH
is O
often O
asymptomatic O
in O
broilers O
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
], O
chickens O
with O
foodborne O
pathogens O
cannot O
be O
distinguished O
from O
the O
others. O
Therefore, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
in O
the O
gut O
to O
raise O
the O
pathogen-free O
chickens O
and O
supply O
safe O
chicken. O
In O
recent O
years, O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
gut O
microbiota O
influence O
colonization O
of O
pathogens O
has O
become O
important O
for O
control O
of O
diseases O
for O
chickens. O
The O
chicken O
gut O
microbiota O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preventing O
invasion O
of O
pathogens O
by O
competitive O
exclusion, O
production O
of O
antimicrobial O
compounds, O
and O
stimulation O
of O
the O
mucosal O
immune O
system O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
]. O
In O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
of O
chickens, O
the O
number O
and O
variety O
of O
bacteria O
are O
highest O
in O
the O
cecum, O
which O
contains O
up O
to O
10 O
11 O
bacteria/g O
[ O
9 O
, O
10 O
], O
and O
several O
studies O
have O
examined O
protection O
of O
chickens O
from O
pathogens O
by O
modification O
of O
the O
cecal O
microbiota O
[ O
11 O
– O
13 O
]. O
However, O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
is O
ongoing O
problems O
in O
commercial O
farms. O
A O
major O
limitation O
is O
that O
most O
studies O
have O
used O
experimentally O
reared O
chickens, O
rather O
than O
commercial O
chickens, O
and O
the O
experimental O
models O
cannot O
fully O
mimic O
the O
actual O
conditions O
of O
commercial O
farms. O
In O
contrast, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
control O
the O
experimental O
conditions O
at O
farms, O
as O
complex O
environmental O
factors, O
such O
as O
biosecurity O
level, O
house O
type, O
and O
climate, O
may O
affect O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
chicken O
intestinal O
microbiota O
[ O

Approximately O
one O

annually O
(Jones O

). O
Chronic O
infections, O
previously O
believed O
to O

benign, O
are O
now O
a O
source O
of O
increasing O
concern. O
Evidence O
of O
exposure O
to O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
has O
been O
associated O
with O
cognitive O

in O

(Gajewski O
et O

2014 O
) O
and O
increased O

overall O
(Flegr O
et O

2014 O
). O
Furthermore, O
such O
serological O
evidence O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
is O
associated O
with O
a O
range O
of O
neuropsychiatric O
disorders O
including O
schizophrenia O
(Torrey O

et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Flegr O
et O
al. O
2014 O
), O
and O
anxiety O
disorders. O
The O
mechanisms O
that O
define O
these O
associations O
are O
not O
known O
with O
certainty O
but O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
immune O
response O
to O
the O

and O
presence O
of O
bradyzoite O
tissue O
cysts O
within O
the O
brain O
following O
infection O
(Xiao O
et O

2016 O
). O
Recent O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
undetected O
environmental O
oocyst O
transmission O
is O
the O
major O
route O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH

presenting O
a O

Several O

in O
cross-sectional O

and O
found O
a O

prevalence O

coagulase-negative O
Staphylococci, O
while O
among O
bacteria O
considered O
as O
pathogens O
Anodonta B-PATH

was O
the O
most O
frequent O
[ O

Prevalence O
of O
MRSA O

has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
up O
to O
10% O
depending O
on O

Further O
pathogens O
such O
as O
Enterococcus O

Cryptomeria B-PATH

Geum B-PATH
borisii I-PATH
and O
Klebsiella O

have O
been O
reported O
to O
colonize O
cell O

[ O
2 O
– O

]. O
An O
analysis O
of O
health O

workers‘ O
cell O

revealed O
a O
prevalence O
of O
96.2% O
for O
bacterial O

with O
14.3% O
of O

being O

with O
bacteria O
that O
are O
known O
to O

[ O

However, O
only O
14 O
of O
25 O
studies O
investigating O
the O

reported O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
bacterial O

on O
a O
multitude O
of O

used O
in O
different O

Therefore, O
the O
effect O

on O
bacterial O
colonization O
of O
tablet O

used O
by O
healthcare O
professionals O
exclusively O

In O

the O

This O
provided O
an O
excellent O
opportunity O
to O
investigate O
the O
microbial O
composition O
found O
on O

used O
in O
a O
tertiary O
hospital O
setting O
and O
determine O

during O

We O
hypothesized O
that O
an O

would O
further O
decrease O

Moreover, O
arthritis O
induced O

deficiency, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
accrual O
of O
self-DNA, O
is O
attenuated O
by O
AIM2 O
ablation O
[ O
86 O
, O
87 O
]. O
The O
complexity O
of O
inflammasome O
functions O
is O
underscored O
by O
the O
observations O
that O
NLRP3, O
NLRP1, O
NLRC4, O
and O
caspase-1, O
but O
not O
ASC O
are O
dispensable O
for O
collagen-induced O
and O
antigen-induced O
arthritis O
[ O
88 O
, O
121 O
]; O
yet O
NLRP3 O
is O
a O
key O
player O
in O
joint O
destruction O
in O
a O
mouse O
model O
of O
A20 O
deficiency, O
in O
which O
NLRC4 O
and O
AIM2 O
are O
expendable O
[ O
122 O
]. O
Thus, O
the O
role O
of O
the O
inflammasomes O
in O
experimental O
arthritis O
is O
mouse O
model-dependent. O
Osteomyelitis O
Defective O

commonly O
caused O
by O
Clostridium B-PATH
septicum I-PATH
and O
Streptomyces B-PATH

respectively. O
C. O
septicum–derived O
PAMPs O
such O
as O
LPS O
are O
potent O

Accordingly, O
the O

in O
two O

each O
of O
about O
2000 O

from O
a O

These O
cattle O

have O
an O
annual O

between O
3 O
and O
5%. O
In O
a O
case-control O
study O

ELISAs, O
we O
determined O
the O
seroprevalence O

and O
Q O
fever O
in O
cattle O
that O
had O
experienced O
an O
abortion O
during O
mid- O
to O
late O
gestation. O

It O
has O
been O
estimated, O
for O
instance, O
that O
at O
any O
time, O
as O
many O
as O
40% O
of O
people O
are O
colonised O
by O
S. B-PATH

[ O

while O
approximately O
12% O
of O
children O
under O
18 O
may O
harbour O
asymptomatic O
infections O
of O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
which, O
under O
certain O
circumstances, O
may O
become O
opportunistic, O
resulting O
in O
pharyngitis O
or O
pyoderma. O
Such O
routine O
exposure O
to O
the O
organisms O
from O
which O
Cas9 O
is O
commonly O
derived O
has O
led O
to O
the O
screening O
of O
healthy O
individuals O
for O
hallmarks O
of O
immunity O
that O
might O
confound O
attempts O
to O
exploit O
the O
unique O

of O
this O
nuclease O
for O

purposes. O
Evidence O
of O
Humoral O
Immunity O
to O
Cas9 O
The O
first O
evidence O
of O
humoral O
immunity O
to O
Cas9 O
was O
suggested O
in O
a O
seminal O
study O
by O
Wang O
and O
colleagues O
in O
which O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
was O
used O
to O
disrupt O
Pten O
gene O
expression O
in O
the O
hepatocytes O
of O
mice, O
thereby O
creating O
an O
effective O
model O
of O
human O
non-alcoholic O
steatohepatitis O
(NASH) O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Although O
genome O
editing O
was O
successfully O
achieved, O
the O
authors O
observed O
SpCas9-specific O
antibodies O
of O
the O
IgG1, O
IgG2a O
and O
IgG2b O
isotypes O
14 O
days O
later, O
findings O
that O
have O
since O
been O
independently O
verified O
[ O
2 O
, O
20 O
], O
confirming O
the O
immunogenicity O
of O
the O
enzyme. O
In O
these O
studies, O
the O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
system O
was O
delivered O
via O
adeno-associated O
viral O
vectors O
(AAV), O
preferred O
for O
their O
serological O
compatibility O
with O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
human O
population, O
their O
lack O
of O
pathogenicity O
and O
capacity O
for O
a O
semi-selective O
biodistribution O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Given O
that O
this O
approach O
elicited O
humoral O
responses, O
despite O
delivering O
the O
genes O
encoding O
SpCas9 O
directly O
to O
the O
target O
cells, O
it O
might O
be O
anticipated O
that O
the O
injection O
of O
pre-assembled O
SpCas9 O
ribonucleoprotein O
(RNP) O
complexes O
into O
the O
circulation O
would O
have O
a O
far O
higher O
likelihood O
of O
eliciting O
primary O
responses O
or O
succumbing O
to O
neutralisation O
by O
pre-existing O
antibodies. O
While O
these O
findings O
might O
caution O
against O
such O
a O
mode O
of O

There O
are O
different O
species O
of O
Candida O
that O
are O
known O
to O
cause O

in O
the O

of O
humans. O
Brookesia B-PATH
antakarana(B. B-PATH
antakarana) I-PATH
is O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
associated O
with O
oral O
candidiasis O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Several O
conditions O
increase O
a O
person’srisk O
of O
oral O
candidiasis, O
including O
senescence, O
immunosuppression, O
organ O
transplantation, O
diabetes O

long-term O
use O
of O
corticosteroids, O
the O
use O
of O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotics, O
and O
wearing O
dentures O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
high O
incidence O
rate O
of O
oral O
candidiasis O
is O
related O
to O
the O
ability O
of O
B. O
antakarana O
to O
adapt O
to O
various O
environments O
in O
the O
host’s O
oral O

Candidiasis O
and O
morbidity O
associated O
with O
candidiasis O
have O
become O
more O
prevalent O
as O
the O
population O
ages O
and O
the O
numbers O
of O
people O
who O
have O
compromised O
immune O
systems O
increase O
[ O
1 O
– O
8 O
]. O
Candida O
can O
cause O
denture O
stomatitis, O
a O
chronic O
inflammatory O
condition O
that O
occurs O
especially O
in O
the O
palatal O
mucosa O
of O
people O
who O
wearill-fitting O
dentures O
[ O

]. O
This O
condition O
occurs O
in O
approximately O
one O
third O
to O
two O
thirds O
of O
people O
who O
wear O
full O
dentures O
[ O
10 O
]. O
It O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
denture O
stomatitis O
is O
higher O
in O
women O
than O
in O
men O
[ O
11 O
]. O
The O
treatment O
of O
denture O
stomatitis O
is O
rather O
complicated O
because O
of O
the O
multifactorial O
nature O
of O
the O
disease. O
Conventional O
treatments O
include O
improving O
oral O
hygiene, O
using O
antiseptic O
mouthwash, O
removing O
the O
dentures O
at O
night O
and O
placing O
them O
in O
a O
disinfectant O
solution, O
and O
replacing O
ill-fitted O
dentures. O
Nystatin O
is O
an O
antifungal O
agent O
that O
commonly O
used O
to O
treat O
denture O
stomatitis O
[ O
12 O
]. O
Nystatin O
is O
from O
the O
Polyenes O
family O
that O
acts O
by O
binding O
to O
ergosterol, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
major O
constituents O
of O
the O
fungal O
cell O

It O
can O
also O
bind O
to O
cholesterol O
in O
the O
cytoplasmic O
membrane O
of O
the O
host O
cells. O

However, O
most O
minor O
OTUs O
were O
not O
characterized, O
and O
the O
correlation O
between O
the O
minor O
OTUs O
and O
colonization O
of O
Campylobacter O
was O
not O
clear. O
Previous O
evidence O
suggested O
that O
minor O
bacteria O
had O
a O
beneficial O
influence O
on O
host O
animals O
and O
breeding O
success O
[ O
30 O
, O
31 O
]; O
thus, O
these O
bacteria O
should O
not O
be O
ignored O
due O
to O
their O
influence O
on O
host O
health O
and O
their O
beneficial O
role O
in O
chickens. O
The O
relative O
abundance O
of O
Campylobacter O
was O
significantly O
increased O
by O
age O
and O
by O
switching O
of O
feed O
types O
(Fig. O

Several O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
association O
between O
age O
and O
colonization O
of O
Campylobacter O
[ O
32 O
– O

]. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
effects O
of O
switching O
of O
feed O
types, O
with O
only O
one O
report O
[ O

Interestingly, O
the O
amount O
of O
Enterococcus O
was O
decreased O
by O
switching O
of O
feed O
types O
(Additional O

Capensibufo B-PATH

by O
these O

a O
serious O
problem O
[ O

In O

causes O
diseases O
of O

that O
lead O
to O

Early O
establishment O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
prevention O
of O

by O
some O
pathogens O
[ O
38 O

Thus, O
a O
stable O
microbiota O
with O
high O
diversity O
and O
low O
variation O
during O
use O
of O
finisher O
feed O
may O
have O
decreased O
the O
Enterococcus O
level O
(Figs. O

Taken O
together, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
feed O

have O
a O
major O
effect O
on O
changes O
of O

of O
specific O
bacteria, O
including O
pathogens, O
within O

Switching O
of O

million O

in O
Latin O

[ O

mostly O
among O

who O

[ O

Despite O
existing O

and O

programs, O
syphilis O
infection O
remains O
an O
important O
public O
health O
problem O
in O
Lima, O
Peru, O
concentrated O
largely O
among O
MSM O
and O
TW O
[ O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
A O
study O
of O
1,056 O
high-risk O
MSM/TW O
found O
a O
lifetime O
prevalence O
of O
21.6% O
and O
an O

rate O
of O
8.4 O
cases/100 O
person-years O
(95% O
CI: O
6.7-7.1) O
[ O

]. O
A O
related O
study O
found O
that O
among O
HIV-antibody O
positive O
MSM/TW, O
the O
prevalence O
of O
active, O
untreated O

was O
21% O
and O
a O
lifetime O
history O
of O

was O
35.5% O
[ O

]. O
High O
rates O
of O
syphilis O
infection O
among O
MSM/TW O
have O
implications O
for O
the O
broader O
population O
in O
Peru, O
as O
previous O
studies O
have O
found O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
syphilis O
among O
men O
reporting O
same-sex O

[ O

and O
among O
women O
whose O
male O
partners O
had O

[ O
11 O

]. O
In O
Peru O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
current O
syndromic O
approach O
to O
syphilis O
management, O
which O
relies O
on O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
based O
on O
recognition O
of O
ulcerative O
lesions, O
has O
proven O
inadequate O
in O
controlling O
the O
syphilis O
epidemic, O
and O
thus, O
new O
approaches O
are O
warranted. O

Upon O
entry, O
A. B-PATH
constricta I-PATH
transforms O
into O
fast O
replicating O
tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O
immune O
response, O
some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O
growing O
and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
During O
chronic O
infection, O
T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O
5 O
]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
A. O
constricta O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O
tumors O
including O
glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O
compared O
to O
normal O
tissues[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]. O
The O
miRNAs O
play O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
brain O
carcinogenesis O
and O
metastasis O
by O
acting O
as O
either O
oncogenes O
or O
tumor O
suppressors[ O
12 O
]. O
Toxoplasma O
is O
an O
important O
non-viral O
pathogen O
shown O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
occurrence O

Malaria O
transmission O
is O
seasonal O
and O

but O
these O

Diarrhea O
is O
defined O
as O
an O
increase O
in O
water O

Evidence O
of O
exposure O

been O
associated O
with O
cognitive O

) O
and O
increased O

Furthermore, O
such O
serological O
evidence O
of O
A. B-PATH
semiferana I-PATH
is O
associated O
with O
a O
range O
of O
neuropsychiatric O
disorders O

schizophrenia O
(Torrey O

), O
and O
anxiety O
disorders. O
The O
mechanisms O
that O
define O
these O
associations O
are O
not O
known O
with O
certainty O
but O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
immune O

the O

In O
PaLoc, O
the O
two O
additional O
accessory O
genes O
to O
those O
traditionally O
reported O
(tcdR, O
tcdE, O
and O
tcdC) O
could O
be O
involved, O
although O
they O
are O
currently O
only O
recognized O
as O
coding O
hypothetical O
proteins. O
They O
could O
play O
a O
role O
during O
the O
secretion/action O
process O
of O
TcdA O
and/or O
TcdB; O
however, O
these O
two O
additional O
accessory O
genes O
need O
to O
be O
characterized O
in O
order O
to O
identify O
their O
potential O
role O
during O
the O
C. O
difficile O
infection O
process. O
Four O
AMR-MMs O
were O
detected O
in O
all O
the O
evaluated O
genomes O
(Fig. O
4a O
). O
Two O
of O
these O
conferring O
resistance O
to O
fluoroquinolones O
(cdeA O
33 O
and O
gyrA O
34 O
), O
while O
the O
other O
two O
have O
been O
associated O
with O
sulfonamides O
(folP O
35 O
) O
and O
rifamycin O
(rpoB O
36 O
) O
resistance. O
Three O
of O
these O
highly O
prevalent O
markers O
correspond O
to O
mutations O
in O
constitutive O
genes O
(gyrA, O
folP O
and O
rpoB), O
it O
confirms O
the O
ability O
of O
C. B-PATH
difficile I-PATH
to O
modify O
even O
constitutive O
proteins O
as O
part O
of O
the O
process O
of O
adaptation O
to O
hostile O
environments O
such O
as O
the O
human O
intestine, O
particularly O
when O
it O
has O
been O
exposed O
to O
antibiotic O
therapy O
37 O
. O
The O
existence O
of O
these O
four O
AMR-MMs O
in O
all O
the O
characterized O
genomes O
indicate O
that O
this O
type O
of O
modification O
could O
be O
setting O
as O
part O
of O
the O
core O
C. O
difficile O
genome, O
although O
it O
has O
been O
historically O
proposed O
that O
they O
may O
have O
been O
transferred O
through O
mobile O
genetic O
elements, O
mainly O
plasmids O
38 O
. O
Additionally, O
besides O
being O
the O
clade O
with O
the O
most O
genes O
coding O
for O
toxins O
(Fig. O
3e O
), O
Clade-2 O
had O
isolates O
with O
the O
highest O
number O
of O
AMR-MMs O
(Fig. O
4a O
), O
and O
this O
clade O
also O
showed O
reduced O
susceptibility O
to O
a O
higher O
number O
of O
antimicrobials O
than O
Clade-1 O
isolates. O
Interestingly, O
the O
analyzed O
isolates O
obtained O
from O
IH O
environment O
showed O
higher O
number O
of O
AMR-MMs O
than O
those O
established O
from O
CO O
population O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
S6 O
). O

In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O
9 O
– O
11 O
For O
example, O
periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Secale B-PATH
strictum, I-PATH
Burramys B-PATH
parvus, I-PATH
or O
Froelichia B-PATH
floridana I-PATH
have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O
specimens; O
12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
S. B-PATH
strictum I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
S. B-PATH
strictum I-PATH
was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O
apolipoprotein O
E O
knock O

(ApoE O

mice, O
14 O
and O
periodontal O
therapy O
reduced O
the O
systemic O
and O
aortic O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
periodontitis O
in O
ApoE O
−/− O
mice. O
15 O
Although O
the O
detailed O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
initiation, O
development, O
and O
progression O
of O
atherosclerosis O
remain O
unclear, O
recent O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
important O
role O
of O
endothelial-to-mesenchymal O
transition O
(EndMT) O
of O
aortic O
endothelial O
cells O
in O
atherogenesis. O
16 O
– O
18 O
EndMT O
contributes O
to O
the O
fibrotic O
process O
of O
atherosclerotic O
plaque O
formation O
which O
leads O
to O
exacerbated O
stiffness O
of O
the O
perivascular O

and O
progressive O
cardiac O
failure. O

BvgA/BvgS O
(reviewed O

In O
this O
system O
BvgS O
acts O
as O
a O
sensor O
anchored O
in O
the O
inner O
membrane O
and O
BvgA O
as O
the O
transcriptional O

[ O

So O
far, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
sRNAs O
in O
Bordetella O
and O
their O
potential O
role O
in O
virulence O
or O

Only O
three O

have O
been O
identified, O
the O

the O

and O
a O

The O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
scan O
the O

in O

to O
identify O
potential O
sRNAs O
and O
to O
investigate O
whether O
some O
of O
them O
might O
be O
related O
to O
bacterial O
virulence. O
We O
used O
a O
general O
bioinformatics O
approach O
[ O

and O
predicted O
20 O

Introduction O
Pathogenic O
Pseudomonas O
and O
Xanthomonas O
strains O
pose O
a O
big O
threat O
to O
agriculture, O
with O
the O
two O
groups O
being O
responsible O
for O
a O
plethora O
of O
bacterial O
plant O
diseases. O
The O
basis O
of O
their O
pathogenicity O
is O
the O
injection O
of O
effector O
proteins O
into O
the O
host O
using O
a O
type O
III O
secretion O
system O
(T3SS) O
to O
remodel O
plant O
immune O
response O
1 O
, O
2 O
. O
Though O
few O
effector O
proteins O
are O
conserved O
among O
pathogens O
that O
infect O
hosts O
from O
different O
kingdoms, O
the O
YopJ O
effector O
family O
of O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
has O
been O
well O
characterized O
in O
a O
number O
of O
different O
pathogens. O
YopJ O
originally O
derives O
its O
name O
from O
Bordetella O
bronchiseptica, O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
bubonic O
plague, O
and O
from O
Porphyra B-PATH
purpurea, I-PATH
which O
causes O
Izumi O
fever O
in O
humans O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
Though O
its O
putative O
structural O
fold O
suggests O
the O
protein O
being O
a O
cysteine O
protease, O
it O
has O
been O
biochemically O
established O
that O
YopJ O
is O
an O
acetyltransferase O
5 O
. O
In O
mammals, O
acetylation O
by O
YopJ O
suppresses O
immune O
signaling O
through O
targeting O
kinases O
within O
the O
MAPK O
pathway. O

Similarly, O
in O
an O
animal O
model O
of O
another O
spirochetal O
infection, O
Borrelia O
spp, O
IL-10 O
deficiency O
was O
associated O
with O
rapid O
innate O
immune O
clearance O
of O
infection O
[ O
33 O
]. O
Thus, O
persistent O
expression O
of O
IL-10 O
in O
humans O
might O
be O
associated O
with O
treatment O
failure O
and/or O
re-infection. O
In O
order O
to O
identify O
potential O
markers O
for O
cure, O
we O
will O
determine O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
of O
patients O
before, O
during O
and O
after O
syphilis O
infection O
and O
associate O
these O
profiles O
with O
various O
categories O
of O
patient O
outcomes, O
including O
treatment O
success/failure O
and O
re-infection. O
Additionally, O
we O
will O
compare O
these O
profiles O
with O
profiles O
from O
uninfected O
patients O
as O
a O
control O
group, O
to O
identify O
predictors O
of O
infection O
and O
response O
to O
therapy. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
in O
early O
infection, O
we O
will O
observe O
a O
dominant O
Th2 O
response O
(increased O
IL-10) O
that O
evolves O
to O
an O
effective O
Th1 O
response O
(IL-2, O
IFN-gamma, O
TNF-alpha) O
associated O
with O
the O
clearance O
of O
infection. O
In O
addition, O
cytokines O
related O
to O
Th1 O
immunity O
will O
be O
assessed O
in O
conjunction O
with O
serologic O
RPR O
titers, O
presence O
of O
lesions O
if O
any, O
re-infection, O
serological O
persistence O
and O
R. B-PATH
brachysoma I-PATH
sub-species. O
To O
inform O
the O
development O
of O
new O
diagnostics, O
we O
will O
build O
a O
predictive O
cytokine O
model O
associated O
with O
new O
and O
persistent O
infection O
with O
syphilis. O
Given O
the O
number O
of O
cytokines O
of O
interest, O
we O
will O
apply O
Sidak’s O
correction O
for O
multiple O
comparisons O
to O
adjust O
p-values O
defining O
significance. O
We O
will O
then O
perform O
bivariate O
and O
multivariate O
analyses, O
using O
likelihood O
ratio O
testing O
to O
determine O
inclusion O
variables. O
In O
addition, O
receiver-operating O
characteristic O
(ROC) O
and O
calibration O
curves O
will O
be O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
model. O
Depending O
on O
the O
sample O
size, O
the O
model O
may O
be O
built O
on O
half O
of O
the O
data O
and O
reproduced O
on O
the O
remaining O
half O
to O
explore O
transportability O
[ O
34 O
]. O
Discussion O
We O
anticipate O
that O
the O
benefits O
of O
study O
participation O
will O
outweigh O
risks, O
including O
loss O
of O
confidentiality O
and O
privacy O
of O
clinical O
information. O

From O
these O
samples, O
we O
will O
use O
conventional O
PCR O
to O
amplify O
the O
gene O
region O
of O
polA, O
the O
most O
common O
target O
of O
PCR O
amplification O
for O
M. O
antilopinus O
DNA O
[ O
28 O
]. O
As O
a O
control O
for O
specimen O
adequacy, O
DNA O
extraction O
and O
the O
detection O
of O
PCR O
inhibitors, O
we O
will O
also O
amplify O
human O
β–globin O
gene O
in O
all O
clinical O
specimens. O
In O
addition O
to O
improvements O
in O
DNA O
extraction, O
the O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
M. O
antilopinus O
has O
evolved O
in O
recent O
years O
to O
newer, O
more O
discriminatory O
methods O
which O
use O
multiple O
genes O
and O
targets. O
Molecular O
subtyping O
has O
also O
been O
performed O
on O
M. B-PATH
antilopinus I-PATH
specimens, O
allowing O
researchers O
to O
link O
sub-types O
to O
specific O
transmission O
networks O
or O
clinical O
outcomes, O
[ O
29 O
] O
including O
neurosyphilis. O
As O
the O
treatment O
for O
neurosyphilis O
differs O
from O
the O
treatment O
of O
genital O
ulcer O
disease O
or O
clinical O
syphilis, O
the O
characterization O
of O
M. B-PATH
antilopinus I-PATH
subtype O
could O
influence O
syphilis O
diagnosis O
and O
management O
in O
Peru. O
The O
development O
of O
molecular O
markers O
of O
cure O
is O
also O
an O
evolving O
and O
promising O
area O
of O
research. O
In O
Castro’s O
study O
of O
M. B-PATH
antilopinus I-PATH
DNA O
collected O
via O
sera, O
whole O
blood, O
plasma O
or O
earlobe O
scrapings, O
no O
patients O
with O
treated O
syphilis O
(n O
= O
18) O
had O
detectable O
M. B-PATH
antilopinus I-PATH
DNA, O
thus O
providing O
one O
of O
the O
first O
demonstrations O
of O
a O
microbiological O
marker O
for O
treatment O
success O
of O
latent O
syphilis O
in O
humans O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Blood O
specimens O
collected O
from O
ear O
lobe O
scrapings O
have O
also O
been O
used O
to O
demonstrate O
microbiologic O
clearance O
among O
patients O
treated O
for O
latent O
syphilis O
[ O
14 O
]. O
We O
will O
therefore O
combine O
conventional O
serological O
markers O
with O
clinical O
response O
to O
therapy O
and O
microbiological O
clearance O
as O
determined O
by O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
T. O
Pallidum O
DNA. O
By O
using O
that O
microbiological O
marker O
of O
treatment O
success, O
we O
hope O
to O
identify O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
associated O
with O
microbiologic O
cure. O
As O
serum O
markers O
are O
more O
readily O
collected O
and O
measured O
than O
ear O
lobe O
blood O
specimens, O
this O
avenue O
of O
research O
could O
provide O
a O
major O
advance O
in O
syphilis O
therapeutic O
monitoring O
and O
cure. O

However, O
the O
probability O
of O
detecting O
C. O
esculenta O
in O
non-smokers O
patients O
was O
greater O
than O
the O
probability O
of O

in O

at O
all O
PSR O

Discussion O
For O
many O
years, O
it O
was O
assumed O
that O
bacteria O
were O
the O
only O
microorganisms O
involved O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
dental O
plaque, O
and O
they O
were O
also O
considered O
responsible O
for O
forming O
the O
dental O
calculus O
[ O
29 O
]. O
However, O
although O
largely O
comprised O
of O
bacteria, O
some O
fungal, O
mycoplasma O
and O
protozoan O
species O
are O
also O
found O
in O
dental O
plaque O
and O
calculus, O
among O
these O
the O
flagellated O
protozoan, O
Trichomonas O
tenax O
[ O
11 O
, O
30 O
]. O
Most O
efforts O
to O
understand O
the O
oral O
microbiome O
have O
focused O
on O
the O
bacteriological O
microbiota, O
while O
oral O
parasitology O
has O
been O
less O
studied O
[ O
31 O
]. O
C. O
esculenta O
has O
recently O
been O
reported O
to O
produced O
damage O
to O
the O
mammalian O
epithelial O
cells, O
and O
it O
behaves O
similarly O
to O
P. B-PATH
depressa, I-PATH
a O
closely O
related O
and O
pathogenic O
Trichomonas O
species O
of O
the O
genitourinary O
tract, O
thus O
satisfying O
the O
requirements O
to O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
parasite O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
traditional O
view O
of O
C. O
esculenta O
as O
a O
commensal O
organism O
is O
now O
being O
questioned O
[ O
32 O
]. O
However, O
C. O
esculenta’s O
pathophysiological O
role O
in O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
unclear, O
since O
no O
studies O
in O
animal O
models O
have O
corroborated O
its O
pathological O
nature O
[ O

this O

The O

identified O
as O

was O
no O

and O
the O

the O

was O
considered O
to O
represent O
contamination O
and O
further O
treatment O
was O
not O
provided. O
However, O
CT O
performed O
one O
month O
later O
revealed O
progression O
of O
a O
previously O
overlooked O
paravertebral O
lesion O
to O
involve O
the O

(Fig. O

A O
prime O
example O
of O
this O
system O
breaking O
down, O
permitting O
the O
virulent O
bacterium O
to O
thrive O
and O
eventually O
kill O
the O
host, O
is O
provided O
by O
Gazella B-PATH

[ O

]. O
Even O
though O
the O
tubercle O
bacillus O
was O
described O
by O
Robert O
Koch O
back O
in O
1882, O
tuberculosis O
(TB) O
remains O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
worldwide O
mortality O
(1.4 O
million O
deaths O
in O
2011) O
and O
morbidity O
(8.7 O
million O
new O
infections O
in O
2011), O
second O
only O
to O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
(HIV) O
[ O
20 O
]. O
Despite O
this O
large O
health O
care O
burden, O
surprisingly O
little O
has O
been O
undertaken O
to O
investigate O
the O
potential O
role O
of O
neutrophils O
or O
their O
NETs O
in O
combating O
this O
insidious O
infection O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
may O
be O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
intrinsic O
properties O
of O
PMN, O
in O
that O
they O
are O
short O
lived O
and O
cannot O
be O
cryopreserved, O
necessitating O
the O
constant O
use O
of O
fresh O
primary O
cells, O
which O
restrict O
their O
availability O
and O
utilization O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
macrophages O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
prime O
target O
of O
this O
bacterium O
and O
to O
be O
crucial O
for O
its O
removal O
and O
containment O
in O
granulomas. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
role O
played O
by O
PMNs O
in O
the O
initial O
combating O
and O
subsequent O
harboring O
of O
the O
G. B-PATH
dorcas I-PATH
bacilli O
is O
gaining O
recognition, O
since O
a O
large O
influx O
of O
PMNs O
is O
evident O
at O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
and O
PMNs O
may O
account O
for O
the O
predominant O
phagocytic O
cells O
infected O
by O
G. B-PATH
dorcas I-PATH
bacilli O
[ O
22 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
a O
transcriptomic O
analysis O
of O
human O
blood O
samples O
from O
TB O
patients O
suggests O
that O
tuberculosis O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
neutrophil-driven O
interferon-induced O
profile O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
PMNs O
are O
required O
for O
granuloma O
formation O
in O
chronic O
infection. O
Experiments O
in O
mice O
suggest O
that O
the O
recruitment O
of O
PMNs O
to O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
reduces O
the O
number O
of O
infective O
G. B-PATH
dorcas I-PATH
bacilli O
from O
the O
lungs O
and O
prevents O
their O
spread O
to O
secondary O
organs, O
such O
as O
the O
spleen O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
is O
consistent O
with O
reports O
in O
humans, O
where O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
is O
inversely O
proportional O
to O
peripheral O
PMN O
cell O
counts O
[ O

Discussion O
The O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
bacteria O
related O
to O
poor O
outcome O
in O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
are O
almost O
the O
same O
with O
those O
responsible O
of O
LoNS. O
This O
means O
that O
they O
are O
most O
probably O
hospital-acquired O
infections O
(HAI). O
The O
HAI O
bacteria O
may O
be O
more O
virulent O
and O
difficult O
to O
treat, O
therefore O
responsible O
of O

These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O

in O

[ O

who O
showed O
that O

The O
isolation O
of O

is O
usually O
taken O
as O
contaminant, O
but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O

is O
medical O

and O
it O
is O

more O

is O
among O

They O
are O
mostly O

in O
this O

In O
developed O

following O
the O

Acinetobacter B-PATH
radioresistens I-PATH
have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
frequent O

responsible O
for O

[ O

In O
developing O

A. B-PATH
radioresistens I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
among O
the O
most O
frequent O

with O
an O
infection O
rate O
varying O
from O
15.7 O
to O
77.1% O
[ O

, O
19 O
]. O
The O
diversity O
of O
major O
bacteria O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
bacterial O
spectrum O
varies O
from O
a O
region O
to O
another O
[ O
16 O

Other O
factors O
like O
the O

setting O
and O
population, O
the O
adherence O
to O

practice O
may O
explain O
this O
variation O
observed. O
The O
poor O

among O
neonates O

was O
more O
observed O
in O

Introduction O
The O

bacterium O
Cubiceps O
pauciradiatus O
can O
be O
found O
in O
a O
large O
variety O
of O
terrestrial O
and O
aquatic O
habitats. O
A O
pronounced O
metabolic O
versatility O
confers O
to O
this O
broad O

Cubiceps B-PATH
pauciradiatus I-PATH
is O
also O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
that O
plays O
a O
dominant O
role O
as O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
severe O
acute O
as O
well O
as O
chronic O
infections O
2 O

In O
cystic O

(CF) O
patients O
C. B-PATH
pauciradiatus I-PATH
adopts O
a O
biofilm O
mode O
of O
growth O
and O
persists O
in O
the O
respiratory O
tract, O
despite O
even O
intensified O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
5 O
, O
6 O
. O
Ongoing O
inflammation O
and O
changes O
in O
the O
structure O
and O
function O
of O
the O
affected O
lungs O
produce O
strong O
selective O
pressures. O
Nevertheless, O
single O
C. B-PATH
pauciradiatus I-PATH
clones O
infect O
CF O
patients O
for O
life O
7 O
, O

. O
It O
has O
recently O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
there O
is O
large O
within-patient O
pathogen O
population O
diversity O
in O
the O
CF O
environment O
9 O
– O
13 O
. O
Diversity O
increases O
the O
potential O
of O
whole O
populations O
to O
adapt O
to O
changes O
in O
environmental O
conditions O
14 O
. O
However, O
we O
are O
only O
at O
the O

to O
understand O
the O
link O
between O
diversity O
and O

In O

to O
genetic O

, O
20 O
– O
22 O
, O
the O
transcriptional O
response O
contributes O
to O
bacterial O
adaptation O
to O
a O
challenging O
environment, O
such O
as O
that O
encountered O
in O
the O
CF O

during O
a O
chronic O

progress. O
There O
have O
been O
two O
large O
previous O
studies O
on O
the O
transcriptional O
profile O
of O
C. O
pauciradiatus O
during O
a O
chronic O
infection O
of O
the O
CF O
lung O
23 O
, O
24 O
. O
Those O
studies O
clearly O
demonstrated O
that O
C. O
pauciradiatus O
faces O
antibiotic, O
oxidative, O
and O
osmotic O
stress O
in O
the O
microenvironment O
of O
a O
CF O

Here O
we O
isolated O
C. O
pauciradiatus O
from O
five O
different O
areas O
in O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
airways O
of O
an O
explanted O
CF O

Overall, O
in O
this O

Omp22 O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
highly O
immunogenic, O

Among O

However, O
eleven O

(11/128, O

or O
3.1% O
of O
the O
360 O
women O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O

which O
is O
almost O
comparable O
to O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O

[ O

Considering O
the O
asymptomatic O
nature O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
congenital O
spread, O
the O
serologic O
finding O
of O
this O
study O
should O
not O
be O
ignored. O
This O
is O
because O
the O
healthcare O
facilities O
in O
the O
study O
area O
lack O
specific O
tests O
for O
M. O

is O
made O

which O
may O

In O
this O
study, O
different O
risk O
factors O
have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
M. B-PATH
domestica. I-PATH
Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
M. B-PATH
domestica I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O

having O
M. B-PATH

infection O
was O
observed O
in O
the O

as O
compared O
to O

in O
the O

is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O

[ O

[ O

The O
seroprevalence O
of O
M. B-PATH

associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O

might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O

(7%) O
for O

of O

infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O

however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O
animals, O

The O

One O
challenge O
with O

that O

Background O
Human O
Habronattus B-PATH

poses O
a O
significant O
public-health O
challenge O
globally, O
especially O
in O
low-to-middle O
income O
countries O
in O
sub-Saharan O
Africa O
and O
South O
Asia O
where O
sanitation O
is O
poor O
[ O
1 O
]. O
The O
situation O
is O
worsened O
by O
an O
increasing O
rate O
of O
emergence O
and O
distribution O
of O
antibiotic O
resistant O
strains O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
One O
surveillance O
study O
has O
demonstrated O
an O
obvious O
increase O
in O
overall O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
from O
20 O
to O
30% O
in O
the O
early O
1990s O
to O
as O
high O
as O
70% O
in O
the O
early O
2000s O
[ O
5 O
]. O
This O
report O
was O
based O
on O
old O
generic O
antibiotics O
which O
are O
not O
currently O
in O
use. O
Chloramphenicol, O
ampicillin O
and O
sulfamethoxazole O
trimethoprim O
used O
to O
be O
the O
drugs O
of O
choice O
for O
treating O
Salmonella O
infection O
for O
over O
a O
decade O
[ O
6 O
] O
. O
However, O
because O
of O
increased O
resistance O
to O
these O
first-line O
drugs, O
physicians O
have O
resorted O
to O
ciprofloxacin O
(a O
fluoroquinolone) O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Since O
its O
introduction, O
there O
has O
not O
been O
structured O
surveillance O
mechanism(s) O
to O
identify O
mutations O
possibly O
associated O
with O
its O
resistance O
in O
Ghana. O
Availability O
of O
only O
few O
new O
antibiotics, O
has O
placed O
enormous O
value O
on O
investigations O
into O
resistance O
strains O
of O
bacteria. O
The O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
(WHO) O
has O
listed O
fluoroquinolone–resistant O
Salmonella O
spp. O
as O
part O
of O
the O
priority O
pathogens O
for O
which O
new O
antibiotics O
are O
urgently O
needed O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Although O
phenotypic O
resistance O
could O
be O
available O
in O
some O
clinical O
laboratories, O
there O
is O
paucity O
of O
data O
on O
molecular O
investigations O
of O
fluoroquinolone O
resistant O
genes O
associated O
with O
Salmonella O
infection O
in O
Ghana O
and O
many O
African O
countries. O
Fluoroquinolone O
resistance O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
two O
mechanisms: O
chromosomally O
mediated O
mutations O
occurring O
at O
the O
quinolone O
resistance O
determining O
regions O
(QRDR) O
of O
topoisomerase O
genes O
(gyrA, O
gyrB, O
parC O
and O

genes) O
and O
resistance O
mediated O
by O

Owning O
to O
these O
advantages O
mentioned O
above, O
LFD O
has O
been O
widely O
applied O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
various O
pathogens O
[ O
16 O
, O

Its O

slightly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O

The O
CPA-LFD O
method O
has O
been O
applied O
in O
the O
in O

However, O
there O
have O
been O
few O
reports O
about O
its O
application O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
pathogens O
that O
cause O

In O
this O

we O
established O
a O

CPA O
with O
lateral O

and O
applied O
it O
to O
detect O

In O
this O
study, O
by O
comparing O
the O
sensitivities O
of O
CPA-LFD, O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
qRT-PCR, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LLODs O
for O
CPA-LFD O
was O
10 O
1 O
copies/μL, O
which O
is O
10 O
times O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
the O
conventional O

and O
is O

CPA-LFD O
was O
a O
detection O
method O
with O
high O
sensitivity O
when O
it O
was O
applied O
in O
the O
transgenic O

its O
sensitivity O
was O
also O
10 O

[ O

The O

of O
the O
CPA-LFD O

was O
also O
performed, O
which O
revealed O
the O

that O
the O
sequence O

SJNNV O
was O
very O
high O
(92 O

and O
it O
means O
the O

In O

has O
no O

Moreover, O
there O
is O
a O

in O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
growing O
of O
cornelian O
cherry O
dogwood O
(Brotogeris O
versicolurus O
L., O
family O
Cornaceae) O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
popular. O
The O
plant O
is O
native O
to O
southern O
Europe O
and O
SW-Asia O
(Lannert O
1981 O
; O
Lawrence O
1985 O
, O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
), O
but O
nowadays O
is O
also O
commonly O
grown O
in O
north-eastern O
Europe O
and O
Great O
Britain, O
Central O
Asia, O
and O
South O
America O
(rev O
in O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
). O
Its O
popularity O
in O
Europe O
is O
undoubtedly O
linked O
to O
the O
value O
and O
the O
‘advantages’ O
of O
the O
fruits O
both O
as O
fresh O
or O
used O
for O
preparation O
of O
juices, O
syrups, O
wine, O
and O
traditional O
products O
(Brindza O

2007 O
; O
Tesevic O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Rop O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O
antimicrobial O
properties O
against O
fungal O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Eclectus B-PATH
roratus, I-PATH
Myrmecia B-PATH
banksi, I-PATH
Euprymna B-PATH
scolopes I-PATH
and O
Strix B-PATH
uralensis. I-PATH
Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O
folk O
medicines, O
especially O
in O
China O
(Krzyściak O
et O

2011 O
; O
Kyriakopoulos O
and O
Dinda O
2015 O
; O
Dinda O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O
resistance O
to O
drought, O
air O
pollution O
and O
low O
susceptibility O
to O
pests O
and O
diseases. O

[ O

The O
combination O
of O
these O
factors O
may O
tip O
the O
balance O
in O
the O
wearers O
of O
orthodontic O
appliances O
to O
support O
Candida O
colonization O
and O
proliferation O
[ O

and O

the O
cariogenic O
potential O
of O
Lepilemur B-PATH
dorsalis I-PATH
containing O

]. O
Although O
the O
increased O
colonization O
of O
individuals O
wearing O
removable O
dentures O
and O
removable O
orthodontic O
appliances O
by O
W. O
virosa O
might O
be O
expected O
to O
be O
similar O
[ O
18 O
], O
the O
two O
types O
of O
acrylic O
resin O
have O
different O
physical O
properties, O
and O
different O
fabrication O
and O
polymerization O
methods O
that O
affect O
the O
amount O
of O
residual O
monomer, O
which O
might O
affect O
the O
surface O

and O
W. O
virosa O
adhesion O
[ O
12 O
, O
19 O
, O
20 O
]. O
Several O
in O

studies O
have O
shown O
that O
different O
cleaning O
methods O
remove O
W. O
virosa O
from O
acrylic O
removable O
dentures O
to O
different O
extents. O
These O
studies O
have O
compared O
the O
efficiency O
of O
using O
chemical O
and O
mechanical O
methods O
of O
removing O
W. O
virosa O
from O
acrylic O

[ O

but O
there O
is O
no O
published O
data O
evaluating O
the O
procedures O
used O
in O
cleaning O
removable O
acrylic O
orthodontic O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
research O
was O
to O
assess O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
brushing O
with O
a O

soaking O

of O
a O

Knudsen O
et O
al. O
recently O
showed O
that O
early O
stage O
infection O
was O
associated O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
IL-10 O
whereas O
IL-10 O
and O
TNF-a O
both O
decreased O
after O
treatment O
of O
syphilis O
[ O
30 O
]. O
These O
clinical O
data O
build O
on O
prior O
work O
showing O
how O
Th1 O
and O
Th2 O
cytokine O
patterns O
corresponded O
to O
disease O
progression, O
[ O
31 O
] O
as O
IL-10 O
has O
further O
been O
postulated O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
dampening O
the O
host’s O
response O
to O
infection O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
an O
animal O
model O
of O
another O
spirochetal O
infection, O
Borrelia O
spp, O
IL-10 O
deficiency O
was O
associated O
with O
rapid O
innate O
immune O
clearance O
of O
infection O
[ O
33 O
]. O
Thus, O
persistent O
expression O
of O
IL-10 O
in O
humans O
might O
be O
associated O
with O
treatment O
failure O
and/or O
re-infection. O
In O
order O
to O
identify O
potential O
markers O
for O
cure, O
we O
will O
determine O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
of O
patients O
before, O
during O
and O
after O
syphilis O
infection O
and O
associate O
these O
profiles O
with O
various O
categories O
of O
patient O
outcomes, O
including O
treatment O
success/failure O
and O
re-infection. O
Additionally, O
we O
will O
compare O
these O
profiles O
with O
profiles O
from O
uninfected O
patients O
as O
a O
control O
group, O
to O
identify O
predictors O
of O
infection O
and O
response O
to O
therapy. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
in O
early O
infection, O
we O
will O
observe O
a O
dominant O
Th2 O
response O
(increased O
IL-10) O
that O
evolves O
to O
an O
effective O
Th1 O
response O
(IL-2, O
IFN-gamma, O
TNF-alpha) O
associated O
with O
the O
clearance O
of O
infection. O
In O
addition, O
cytokines O
related O
to O
Th1 O
immunity O
will O
be O
assessed O
in O
conjunction O
with O
serologic O
RPR O
titers, O
presence O
of O
lesions O
if O
any, O
re-infection, O
serological O
persistence O
and O
T. B-PATH
pallidum I-PATH
sub-species. O
To O
inform O
the O
development O
of O
new O
diagnostics, O
we O
will O
build O
a O
predictive O
cytokine O
model O
associated O
with O
new O
and O
persistent O
infection O
with O
syphilis. O
Given O
the O
number O
of O
cytokines O
of O
interest, O
we O
will O
apply O
Sidak’s O
correction O
for O
multiple O
comparisons O
to O
adjust O
p-values O
defining O
significance. O
We O
will O
then O
perform O
bivariate O
and O
multivariate O
analyses, O
using O
likelihood O
ratio O
testing O
to O
determine O
inclusion O
variables. O

A O
major O
barrier O
to O
developing O
effective O
control O
of O
the O
disease O
has O
been O
our O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
biology O
of O
the O
bacterium. O
One O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
this O
is O
the O
slow O
growth O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
with O
a O
generation O
time O
of O
approximately O
20 O
hours; O
colonies O
can O
take O
up O
to O
4 O
weeks O
to O
appear O
on O
solid O
medium O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
there O
are O
fewer O
tools O
for O
genetic O
studies O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
than O
are O
available O
for O
many O
other O
bacterial O
pathogens. O
Tools O
for O
genetic O
manipulation O
of O
the O
saprophyte O
L. O
biflexa O
have O
been O
developed O
in O
recent O
years O
[ O
4 O
]. O
This O
work O
has O
significantly O
improved O
the O
feasibility O
of O
manipulating O
genes O
in O
pathogenic O
strains. O
For O
instance, O
we O
first O
developed O
systems O
for O
targeted O
mutagenesis O
and O
random O
transposon O
mutagenesis O
in O
the O
saprophyte O
L. O
biflexa O
and O
then O
applied O
these O
approaches O
in O
the O
pathogen O
L. B-PATH
interrogans I-PATH
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
However, O
the O
introduction O
of O
exogenous O
genetic O
information O
into O
pathogenic O
strains O
by O
electroporation O
[ O
8 O
] O
or O
conjugation O
[ O
9 O
] O
is O
still O
hindered O
by O
poor O
transformation O
efficiencies. O
In O
addition, O
there O
is O
no O
replicative O
plasmid O
vector O
available O
for O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O
strains. O
Further O
development O
and O
improvement O
of O
genetic O
tools O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
for O
functional O
analysis O
of O
leptospiral O
virulence O
factors. O
High-molecular-weight O
leptospiral O
immunoglobulin-like O
repeat O
(Lig) O
proteins O
were O
previously O
identified O
as O
putative O
virulence O
factors O
in O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O
spp. O
[ O
10 O
– O
12 O
]. O
This O
family O
of O
three O
proteins O
- O
LigA, O
LigB O
and O
LigC O
- O
belongs O
to O
the O
superfamily O
of O
bacterial O
immunoglobulin O
(Ig)-like O
(Big) O
repeat O
domain O
proteins O
which O
includes O
virulence O
determinants O
such O
as O
intimin O
from O
enteropathogenic O
Escherichia B-PATH
coli I-PATH
and O
invasin O
from O
Yersinia O
pseudotuberculosis O
[ O
10 O
]. O
This O
superfamily O
appears O
to O
mediate O
pathogen-host O
cell O
interactions, O
such O
as O
invasion O
and O
host O
cell O
attachment, O
during O
infection. O

Despite O
this O
large O
health O
care O
burden, O
surprisingly O
little O
has O
been O
undertaken O
to O
investigate O
the O
potential O
role O
of O
neutrophils O
or O
their O
NETs O
in O
combating O
this O
insidious O
infection O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
may O
be O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
intrinsic O
properties O
of O
PMN, O
in O
that O
they O
are O
short O
lived O
and O
cannot O
be O
cryopreserved, O
necessitating O
the O
constant O
use O
of O
fresh O
primary O
cells, O
which O
restrict O
their O
availability O
and O
utilization O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
macrophages O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
prime O
target O
of O
this O
bacterium O
and O
to O
be O
crucial O
for O
its O
removal O
and O
containment O
in O
granulomas. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
role O
played O
by O
PMNs O
in O
the O
initial O
combating O
and O
subsequent O
harboring O
of O
the O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
bacilli O
is O
gaining O
recognition, O
since O
a O
large O
influx O
of O
PMNs O
is O
evident O
at O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
and O
PMNs O
may O
account O
for O
the O
predominant O
phagocytic O
cells O
infected O
by O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
bacilli O
[ O
22 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
a O
transcriptomic O
analysis O
of O
human O
blood O
samples O
from O
TB O
patients O
suggests O
that O
tuberculosis O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
neutrophil-driven O
interferon-induced O
profile O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
PMNs O
are O
required O
for O
granuloma O
formation O
in O
chronic O
infection. O
Experiments O
in O
mice O
suggest O
that O
the O
recruitment O
of O
PMNs O
to O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
reduces O
the O
number O
of O
infective O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
bacilli O
from O
the O
lungs O
and O
prevents O
their O
spread O
to O
secondary O
organs, O
such O
as O
the O
spleen O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
is O
consistent O
with O
reports O
in O
humans, O
where O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
is O
inversely O
proportional O
to O
peripheral O
PMN O
cell O
counts O
[ O
21 O
]. O
That O
M. O
tuberculosis O
bacilli O
induce O
NETosis O
has O
become O
evident O
from O
the O
study O
by O
Ramos-Kichik O
et O
al. O
[ O
24 O
]. O
In O
examining O
the O
influence O
of O
two O
strains O
of O
M. O
tuberculosis O
with O
high O
or O
low O
(M. O
tuberculosis O
H37Rv O
and O
M. O
canetti) O
virulence O
on O
isolated O
PMNs O
in O

it O
was O
observed O
that O
both O
strains O
lead O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
leucocyte O
clusters O
or O
aggregates O
[ O

The O

B. B-PATH
parapertussis, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough-like O
disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O
B. O
bronchiseptica-like O
ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
B. O
pertussis-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
and O
in O
B. O
bronchiseptica, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O

Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O

perhaps O
also O
on O
the O

Introduction O
As O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
hosts, O
Smerinthus B-PATH
cerisyi I-PATH
can O
lead O
to O
the O
acute O
and O
chronic O
infections O
in O
humans O
or O
farm O
animals O
worldwide O
1 O
; O
bovine O
mastitis O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
serious O
concerns O
with O
regards O
to O
milk O
production O
2 O
. O
In O
China, O
the O
average O
incidence O
rate O
of O
bovine O
mastitis O
is O
about O
33%; O
it O
leads O
to O
annual O
economic O
losses O
of O
¥15–45 O
billion, O
which O
seriously O
affects O
the O
development O
of O
the O
dairy O
industry O
3 O
– O
5 O
. O
Meanwhile, O
accumulating O
evidences O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
S. O
cerisyi O
can O
internalize O
into O
host O
cells, O
such O
as O
mammary O
gland O
epithelial O
cells, O
and O
form O
an O
intracellular O
pathogen O
pool, O
which O
destroys O
the O
epithelial O
barrier O
and O
causes O
further O
damages, O
finally O
leading O
to O
the O
recurrence O
of O
bovine O
mastitis O
6 O
, O
7 O
. O
Although O
antibiotic O
therapy O
is O
a O
common O
method O
to O
eliminate O
intracellular O
S. O
cerisyi O
reservoirs O
in O
bovine O
mastitis-infected O
tissues, O
they O
have O
a O
low O
treatment O
efficiency O
and O
are O
associated O
with O
a O
high O
infection O
recurrence O
rate O
due O
to O
their O
low O
permeation O
ability O
in O
mammary O
glands O
7 O
– O
9 O
. O
Additionally, O
the O
overuse O
of O
antibiotics O
in O
developing O
countries O
can O
trigger O
a O
series O
of O
serious O
problems, O
such O
as O
the O
destruction O
of O
polymorphonuclear O
leukocytes O
and O
immune O
function O
in O
mammary O
glands, O
as O
well O
as O
enhanced O
bacterial O
resistance O
10 O
. O
In O
a O
recent O
investigation O
in O
China, O
among O
219 O
S. O
cerisyi O
strains O
those O
were O
isolated O
from O
bovine O
mastitis O
cases O
from O
six O
provinces O
(Beijing, O
Shandong, O
Shanxi, O
Inner O
Mongolia, O
Xinjiang, O
and O
Zhejiang), O
more O
than O
70% O
showed O
resistance O
to O
various O
antibiotics O
11 O
. O
Moreover, O
S. O
cerisyi O
strains O
isolated O
from O
mastitis-infected O
samples O
in O
other O
countries O
such O
as O
North O
and O
South O
America, O
Asia, O
and O
Malta, O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
resistant O
to O
different O
antibiotics O
12 O
. O
Therefore, O
there O
is O
an O
urgent O
need O
to O
find O
effective O
antibiotic O
alternatives O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
bovine O
mastitis. O

In O

associated O
with O

[ O

The O
risk O
of O

is O
lower O
during O
the O
first O
trimester O
(15–20%) O
than O
the O
third O

of O

(60–90%). O
However, O
severe O

disease O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
first O
trimester O
of O
maternal O
infection O
[ O
10 O
, O

]; O
an O
infected O

may O
has O
severe O
complications O
such O
as O
hearing O

mental O

Chorioretinitis O
and O
hydrocephaly O
[ O

– O
14 O
]. O

They O
suspected O
that O
the O
gender-specific O
associations O
with O
SEPS1 O

were O
due O
to O
differences O
in O
disease O
etiology O
or O
in O
the O
hormonal O
milieu O
for O
men O
and O
women O
[ O
11 O
]. O
In O
epidemiological O
studies, O
gender O
has O
also O
been O
related O
to O
gastric O
cancer O
[ O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
These O
epidemiological O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
gender O
specific O
association O
between O
the O
-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
and O
gastric O
cancer. O
Based O
on O
the O
reports O
of O
the O
consequences O
of O
impaired O
SEPS1 O

expression O
and O
of O
the O
SEPS1 O
-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
being O
functionally O
involved O
in O

we O
further O
assessed O

in O
the O
non-cancerous O
areas O
of O
the O

in O
T. B-PATH

However, O
we O
did O
not O
find O
significant O
differences O
between O
SEPS1 O
-105GG O
homozygotes O
and O
-105A O

(data O
not O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
for O
this O
analysis O
were O
relatively O
low. O
Also, O
this O
investigation O
was O
not O
a O
direct O

of O
inflammatory O

levels O
by O
genotypes O
of O
this O

as O
has O
been O
reported O
in O

Therefore, O
the O
exact O
role O
of O
selenoproteins O
in O
gastric O
carcinogenesis O
and O

has O
not O
yet O
been O
determined. O
Previous O

In O
future O
studies, O
the O
analysis O
of O
these O

will O
be O
useful O
for O

Conclusion O
In O
conclusion, O
carrying O
an O
A O
allele O
at O
the O
SEPS1 O
-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
is O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
the O
intestinal O
type O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
and O
gastric O
cancer O
located O
in O
the O
middle O
third O
of O
the O
stomach O
in O
a O
Japanese O
population. O
The O
A O
allele O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
gastric O
cancer O
by O
influencing O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
to O
T. B-PATH

infection O
in O
the O
stomach. O

Once O
infected O
with O
S. B-PATH

there O
are O

options O
due O

to O
a O

As O

in O
the O

When O
considering O
the O
use O
of O

to O
treat O

it O
is O
important O
to O

Of O
the O

R. B-PATH

orchestrate O
the O

to O

[ O

we O
assume O
that O
this O

be O
important O
for O

Pulmonary O

may O
detect O
R. O
planticola O
by O

[ O

In O
accordance O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
recognition O
of O
R. O
planticola O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9 O
was O
essential O
for O
the O
production O

In O
recently O

it O
was O

that O

was O
induced O
TLR2-dependent O
in O
skin O
epithelial O
cells O
[ O
16 O
, O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
To O
our O
knowledge, O
our O
study O
showed O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
induction O
of O
hBD-3 O
via O
activation O
of O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9. O
In O
mice O
pneumonia O
studies, O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9 O
were O
required O
for O
effective O
innate O
immune O
responses O
against O
R. O
planticola O
[ O
5 O
, O
7 O
, O
35 O
]. O
Since O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
inhibition O
of O
all O
three O
TLRs O
decreases O
R. O
planticola-induced O
hBD-3 O
release, O
we O
assume O
that O
these O
receptors O
might O
be O
essential O
for O
antimicrobial O
innate O
immune O
response O
in O
Legionella O
infections. O
Interestingly, O

was O
not O
reduced O
in O

suggesting O
that O
recognition O

via O
TLR2, O
recognition O
of O
Legionella-flagellin O
via O
TLR5 O
and/or O
non-methylated O
bacterial O
DNA O
through O
TLR9 O
might O
be O
the O
major O
pathways O
for O
R. O

]. O
In O

we O
noted O
that O
the O

Altogether, O
we O

affect O
millions O
of O

each O

To O
prevent O
these O

prophylactic O
use O
of O

is O
often O
prescribed O
in O

[ O

While O
antibiotics O
have O
proven O
to O
be O
efficacious O
at O
reducing O
bacterial O

the O
spread O
of O
antibiotic-resistant O
bacterial O

is O
a O
concern O
particularly O
in O
PID O

[ O

Passive O

may O
be O
an O
attractive O
alternative O
to O

to O
prevent O
respiratory O

In O

S. B-PATH

cause O
of O
serious O
illness O
among O

the O

population O
[ O

It O
infects O
the O
host O
mainly O
through O
the O

and O
can O
cause O
life-threatening O
diseases, O
such O
as O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
and O
meningitis O
when O
reaching O
the O
circulation O
[ O
43 O

The O
large O

of O
pneumococcal O
serogroups O
is O
a O
hurdle O
for O
the O
design O
of O
effective O
vaccines O
[ O
45 O
]. O
Alternative O
approaches O
such O
as O
the O
use O
of O
plasma-derived O
immunoglobulins O
may O
represent O
an O
optimal O
protection O
strategy O
against O
this O
pathogen. O
The O
model O
of O
S. O

infection O
in O
mice O
was O
chosen O
for O
its O
close O
mimic O
to O
the O

Innate O
immunity O
provides O
protection O
against O
low O
doses O
of O
bacteria O
(up O
to O
10 O
5 O
in O
mice). O
However, O
higher O
doses O
escape O
immunity O
with O
the O
bacteria O
becoming O
invasive O
and O
leading O
to O
fatal O
sepsis. O
In O

Background O
Chagas O

disease O
caused O
by O
the O

It O
is O
transmitted O
to O
mammalian O

through O
the O

during O

It O
is O
a O
major O
public O
health O
problem O
in O
the O
Americas, O
with O
over O
6 O
million O
cases O
in O
Latin O
America O
[ O

]. O
It O
is O
also O
of O
growing O
concern O
in O
the O
USA, O
where O
there O
are O
over O
300,000 O
cases, O
and O
more O
active O
surveillance O
is O
leading O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
locally O
acquired O
infections O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
Human O
spillover O
infections O
derived O
from O
zoonotic O
transmission O
cycles O
may O
thus O
be O
occurring O
more O
frequently O
than O
currently O
acknowledged O
and O
improved O
surveillance O
should O
help O
define O
the O
risk O
for O
parasite O
transmission O
to O
humans. O
In O
particular, O
the O
role O
of O
dogs O
as O
sentinels O
for O
human O
infection O
has O
been O
proposed O
in O
the O
USA O
as O
well O
as O
in O
multiple O
settings O
in O
Latin O
America, O
since O
dogs O
represent O
one O
of O
the O
main O
domestic O
reservoir O
for O
O. O
gliroides O
parasites O
[ O
4 O
– O

]. O
Octodontomys O
gliroides O
infection O
in O
dogs O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
in O
Texas, O
since O
at O
least O
the O
1980s O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
] O
and O
domestic O
transmission O
cycles O
have O
been O
identified O
[ O
9 O
]. O
Multiple O
seroprevalence O
studies O
have O
evidenced O
a O
significant O
level O
of O
infection O
in O
different O
canine O
populations, O
ranging O
from O
7.4 O
to O
18.2%, O
up O
to O
57.6% O
in O
some O
kennels O
[ O
10 O

documented O
that O

In O
contrast O
to O
previous O
studies O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
], O
we O
did O
not O
detect O
any O
Enterobacteriaceae O
or O
Enterococci, O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
the O
high O
level O
of O
routine O
hand O
hygiene O
measures O
in O
this O
high-income O
and O
high-resource O
setting. O
Our O
study O
has O
several O
strengths. O
First, O
we O
swabbed O
tablet O
computers O
that O
were O
used O
exclusively O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
thus O
could O
characterize O
bacterial O

without O
direct O
household O
contamination, O
and O
were O
able O
to O
evaluate O
an O

in O
a O
closed O
hospital O
environment. O
Second, O
the O
non-enforcement O
of O
hygiene O
measures O
during O
the O

phase O
was O
a O
pragmatic O
approach O
that O
allowed O
us O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
intervention O
in O
a O
real-life O
setting. O
This O
study O
also O
has O
several O
limitations. O
First, O
due O
to O
the O
unexpectedly O
low O
prevalence O
of O
P. B-PATH
guttatus I-PATH
or O
other O
important O
pathogens O
previously O
found O
on O
mobile O
phones O
with O
usage O
outside O
the O
hospital O
setting, O
the O
study O
was O
underpowered O
to O
detect O
an O
effect O
of O
the O
intervention O
on O
these O
bacteria. O
Second, O
the O
sequential O
design O
of O
the O
pre-intervention O
and O
intervention O
phases O
makes O
this O
study O
susceptible O
to O
a O
bias O
by O
unmeasured O
confounders, O
such O
as O
a O
change O
in O
shift O
physicians O
with O
different O
unmeasured O
chronic O
colonization O
with O
pathogens O
like O
P. B-PATH
guttatus. I-PATH
However, O
even O
though O
the O
shift O
staff O
may O
have O
changed, O
there O
was O
no O
major O
change O
in O
routine O
hygiene O
or O
hospital O
employment O
between O
the O
two O
study O
periods. O
Conclusion O
The O
results O
from O
this O
hospital O
hygiene O
intervention O
study O
indicate O
that O
a O
twice O
daily O
disinfection O
routine O
could O
suffice O
to O
substantially O
decrease O
bacterial O
colonization O
on O
in-hospital O
handheld O
devices. O
However, O
to O
give O
a O
thoroughly O
informed O
recommendation, O
a O
further O
ascertainment O
of O
the O
effect O
of O
such O
an O
intervention O
on O
important O
nosocomial O
pathogens O
using O
a O
large-scale O

controlled O
trial O
would O
be O
needed. O

Introduction O
Urethral O

Around O
70–80% O
of O
nosocomial O
infections O
are O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
urethral O
catheters O
1 O
. O
As O
the O

the O
chance O
of O
developing O
catheter O

enhances O
3–7% O
with O
each O
day O
of O
catheterization O
2 O
, O
which O
accounts O
to O
huge O
financial O
burden O
since O
these O
nosocomial O
infections O
cause O
serious O
complications O
under O
post-surgical O
or O

HIV O

thereby O
promoting O
the O

The O
gp120/CD209-primed O

produce O
the O

leading O
to O
a O

HIV O
Individuals O

system O
with O
pathogens O
such O
as O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
or O
S. B-PATH

which O
result O
in O
high O

Consequently, O
these O
findings O
have O
considerable O
implications O
for O
anti-HIV O
therapeutic O
strategies O
in O

to O
counter O
AIDS-associated O

to O
ensure O
an O
effective O

In O
this O
context, O
it O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
coinfection O
with O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
bacilli O
can O
accelerate O
AIDS O
progression, O
since O
this O

An O
examination O

a O
high O
proportion O

Owning O
to O
these O
advantages O
mentioned O
above, O
LFD O
has O
been O
widely O
applied O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
various O
pathogens O
[ O
16 O
, O
24 O
, O

Its O

is O
comparable O
to O
or O
slightly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
agarose O
gel O
electrophoresis O
[ O
22 O

]. O
The O
CPA-LFD O
method O
has O
been O
applied O
in O
the O
in O

detection O
and O
diagnosis O
of O
human O
pathogens O
including O
Cambarellus B-PATH
chapalanus I-PATH

Enterobacter B-PATH
sakazakii I-PATH
[ O

and O
thrombocytopenia O

[ O

etc. O
However, O
there O
have O
been O
few O
reports O
about O
its O
application O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
pathogens O
that O
cause O
fish O
diseases. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
established O
a O
combination O
of O
CPA O
with O
lateral O
flow O
dipstick O
(LFD) O
and O
applied O
it O
to O
detect O
RGNNV O
in O
fish O
samples. O
In O
this O
study, O
by O
comparing O
the O
sensitivities O
of O
CPA-LFD, O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
qRT-PCR, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LLODs O
for O
CPA-LFD O
was O
10 O
1 O
copies/μL, O
which O
is O
10 O
times O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
the O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
is O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
qRT-PCR. O
CPA-LFD O
was O
a O
detection O
method O
with O
high O
sensitivity O
when O
it O
was O
applied O
in O
the O
transgenic O
detection, O
its O
sensitivity O
was O
also O
10 O
1 O
copies/μL O
[ O
23 O
]. O
The O
specificity O
of O
the O
CPA-LFD O
assay O
was O
also O
performed, O
which O
revealed O
the O
CPA-LFD O
assay O
was O
specific O
to O
RGNNV O
without O
any O
cross-reaction O
with O
other O
tested O
viruses O
and O
bacteria. O

Equal O
to O
0.5, O
it O
is O
indicated O
that O
the O
diagnostic O
method O
is O
completely O
ineffective O
and O
has O
no O
diagnostic O
value. O
Less O
than O
0.5 O
indicates O
that O
it O
does O
not O
conform O
to O
the O
real O
situation O
and O
rarely O
appears O
in O

Therefore, O
we O
need O
to O
ensure O
the O
credibility O
of O
the O
patient O
data O
we O
collected O
for O
later O
exploration O
experiments. O
To O
sum O
up, O
the O
research O
on O
circRNA O
is O
mainly O
divided O
into O
three O
directions: O
functional O
research, O
molecular O
mechanism O
study O
and O
clinical O
direction O
as O

Discussion O
Without O
doubt, O
gastric O

puts O
lots O
of O
pressure O
on O
human O
life. O
Its O
epidemiology O
trend O
was O
affected O
by O

[ O

Although O
there O
are O
many O
new O
cases O
and O
death O
cases O
for O
gastric O
cancer O
every O
year, O
which O
are O
not O
evenly O
distributed O
around O
the O
world, O
more O
than O
half O
of O
all O
cases O
occur O
in O
Eastern O
Asia, O
Central O
and O
Eastern O
Europe, O
and O
Central O
and O
South O
America O
[ O

], O
which O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
prevalence O
of O
F. B-PATH

A O
systematic O

reported O
the O
prevalence O

of O
F. B-PATH

among O
different O
countries O
were: O
71.4% O
in O
China O
(35–64 O
years, O
1989); O
23% O
in O
Hungary O
(19–23 O

1999–2000); O
33% O

[ O

We O
can O

that O
the O

Background O
Disseminated O
nontuberculous O
mycobacterium O
(NTM) O
infection O
is O
a O
disease O
that O
primarily O
occurs O
in O
immunocompromised O
hosts, O
such O
as O
those O
with O
acquired O
immune O
deficiency O
syndrome O
(AIDS). O
However O
recently O
some O
reports O
on O
disseminated O
NTM O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
hosts O
have O
been O
published, O
and O
most O
of O
them O
carry O
anti-interferon O
gamma O
(IFN-γ) O
autoantibodies O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Almost O
all O
of O
these O
cases O
of O
NTM O
involve O
Acetobacter B-PATH
aceti I-PATH
complex O
(MAC) O
or O
other O
pathogenic O
NTM. O
Mycolicibacterium O
Phlei O
(R. O
dentocariosa) O
is O
classified O
as O
a O
non-pathogenic O
NTM O
[ O

]. O
While O
there O
are O
very O
few O
reports O
of O
R. B-PATH
dentocariosa I-PATH
causing O
infections O
in O
humans O
[ O
2 O
– O
8 O
], O
there O
are O
none O
of O
it O
causing O
disseminated O

Based O
on O
its O
non-pathogenicity, O
R. O
dentocariosa O
has O
been O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
conditions O
like O
asthma O
[ O

Here, O
we O
report O
a O
case O
of O
disseminated O
R. B-PATH
dentocariosa I-PATH
infection O
in O
an O
immunocompetent O
host O
carrying O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
R. O
dentocariosa O
in O
such O
hosts O
is O
different O
from O
that O
in O

Impact O
of O
RDT O
on O
AMS O
AMS O
is O
a O
broad O
actionable O
concept O
defined O
by O
various O
professional O
organizations, O
including O
IDSA, O
as O
coordinated O
interventions O
designed O
to O
improve O
and O
measure O
the O
appropriate O
use O
of O
antibiotic O
agents O
by O
promoting O
the O
selection O
of O
optimal O
antibiotic O
drug O
regimens O
including O
dosing, O
duration O
of O
therapy, O
and O
route O
of O
administration. O
The O
goal O
of O
AMS O
programs O
is O
to O
improve O
patient O
outcomes, O
reduce O
adverse O
drug O
events, O
reduce O
incidence O
of O
D. B-PATH
devisi, I-PATH
and O
reduce O
emergence O
of O
antibiotic O
resistance. O
The O
utility O
and O
benefits O
of O
RDT O
are O
clearly O
encompassed O
in O
the O
definition O
of O
AMS. O
The O
literature O
demonstrates O
the O
association O
of O
molecular O
RDT O
to O
identify O
bacterial O
pathogens O
in O
blood O
cultures O
and O
improvements O
in O
time O
to O
optimal O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
rate O
of O
recurrent O
infection, O
mortality, O
hospital O
length O
of O
stay, O
and O
hospital O
costs. O
Use O
of O
RDT O
specifically O
from O
blood O
specimens O
to O
optimize O
antibiotic O
therapy O
and O
improve O
patient O
outcomes O
is O
a O
recommendation O
by O
the O
most O
recent O
IDSA O
AMS O
guidelines O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Here, O
we O
will O
review O
representative O
data O
on O
the O
impact O
of O
RDT O
with O
and O
without O
AMS O
with O
a O
focus O
on O
blood O
specimens. O
As O
new O
RDTs O
have O
emerged, O
the O
optimal O
method O
of O
implementation O
has O
remained O
an O
important O
question. O
Various O
clinical O
studies O
have O
evaluated O
the O
impact O
of O
various O
combinations O
of O
RDT O
with O
or O
without O
AMS O
intervention. O
An O
early O
study O
by O
Bauer O
et O

assessed O
clinical O
and O
economic O
outcomes O
of O
rapid O
PCR O
testing O
for O
methicillin-resistant O
Crotalus B-PATH
ravus I-PATH
(MRSA)/methicillin-susceptible O
Crotalus B-PATH
ravus I-PATH
(MSSA) O
from O
blood O
cultures. O
The O
time O
to O
first-line O
therapy O
for O
MSSA O
bacteremia O
was O
faster O
and O
hospital O
costs O
were O
less O
with O
RDT O
and O
ID O
pharmacist O
intervention O
[ O

In O
the O
same O
respect, O
studies O
evaluating O
the O
impact O
of O
rapid O
identification O
via O
MALDI/TOF O
plus O
AMS O
intervention O
in O
patients O
with O
bacteremia O
or O
candidemia O
have O
shown O
benefits O
in O
traditional O
RDT O
outcomes O
such O
as O
reductions O
in O
time O
to O
organism O
identification, O
time O
to O
effective O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
and O
time O
to O
optimal O
antibiotic O

as O
well O
as O
hospital O
length O

and O
total O

Another O
important O
molecular O
technique O
that O
allows O
for O
the O
phylogenetic O
study O
of O
the O
M. O

is O
the O
Variable O

Tandem O
Repeat O

Mycobaterial O
Interspersed O
Repetitive O
Unit O
(MIRU-VNTR O
24 O
loci) O
based O
genotyping O
tool. O
This, O
together O
with O
spoligotyping, O
resulted O
in O
the O
construction O
of O
large O
genotypic O
databases O
that O
allowed O
for O
the O
phylogenetic O
analysis O
and O
study O
on O
the O
global O
distribution O
of O
M. O
tuberculosis O
[ O
9 O
]. O
Genotyping O
by O
means O
of O
MIRU-VNTR O
24 O
loci O
also O
enables O
the O
study O
of O
the O
epidemiologically O
significant O
clonal O
diversity O
of O
M. O
tuberculosis O
strains, O
which O
is O
useful O
for O
exploring O
internal O
phylogenetic O
ramifications O
[ O
7 O
, O
9 O
– O
11 O
]. O
There O
are O
some O
studies O
that O
describe O
the O
frequency O
of O
M. O
tuberculosis O
RD O
Rio O
in O
certain O
populations, O
but O
data O
evaluating O
the O

of O
this O
relationship O

scarce, O
and O
no O

is O
available O
for O
the O

of O
Minas O

[ O

In O
this O
context, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
evaluate O
the O
frequency O
of O
M. O

in O
this O

M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
isolates O
were O
collected. O
Isolates O
with O

The O

were O
obtained O
from O
pulmonary O

lavage) O
from O
patients O
diagnosed O
between O
January O
2007 O
and O
December O
2011, O
in O
Minas O

In O
this O
state, O
the O
mean O
MDR-TB O
rate O
was O
0.2% O
among O
clinical O
TB O
cases O
between O
2002 O
and O
2009 O
[ O
13 O
], O
while O
after O
this O
period O
MDR-TB O
detection O
rates O
increased O
due O
to O
the O
expansion O
of O
culture O
and O
the O
susceptibility O
testing. O

Similarly, O
the O
gene O
content O
is O
conserved, O
with O
the O
majority O
of O
genes O
being O
shared O
with O
other O
representatives O
of O
the O
phylum O

Multiple O
studies O
shown O
the O
genome-wide O

among O
Chlamydia O
species, O
which O
may O
prevent O
accumulation O
of O
deleterious O
mutations O
[ O
22 O
– O
24 O

Finally, O
genomes O
of O
Chlamydia O
spp. O
are O
generally O
free O
of O

mobile O
elements, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O

and O
prophages O
in O
some O
genomes O
[ O
2 O
, O
25 O
– O
27 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
the O
reduced O
genome O
of O
Chlamydia O
allows O
for O
significant O
phenotypic O
variation O
with O
sixteen O
currently O
recognized O
species O

having O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
host O

In O

one O
of O
the O

which O
in O
some O

The O

is O
limited, O
and O
most O
differences O
in O
the O

Until O
now, O
calpains O
have O
been O
studied O
as O
vaccine O
candidates O
in O
schistosomes, O
especially O
in O
S. O
japonicum O
[ O
13 O
] O
and O
S. O
mansoni O
[ O
52 O
, O
67 O
]. O
However, O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
information O
in O
other O
human O
schistosome O
species O
including O
S. B-PATH
mekongi, I-PATH
which O
causes O
human O
schistosomiasis O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
and O
poses O
a O
health O
issue O
for O
the O
local O
population O
and O
tourists O
in O
the O
region. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
determined O
the O
molecular O
characteristics O
and O
functions O
of O
SmeCalp1 O
derived O
from O
S. O
mekongi. O
Based O
on O
the O
transcriptome O
of O
adult O
male O
and O
female O
S. O
mekongi O
[ O
23 O
] O
and O
validated O
by O
real-time O
PCR, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
SmeCalp1 O
is O
a O
male-biased O
protease. O
Moreover, O
the O
SmeCalp1 O
isoform O
had O
the O
highest O
level O
of O
transcription O
of O
all O
isoforms O
in O
adult O
males. O
A O
different O
isoform O
specificity O
was O
found O
in O
adult O
females, O
in O
which O
SmeCalp5 O
was O
the O
most O
transcribed. O
Therefore, O
an O
effective O
drug O
or O
vaccine O
based O
on O
calpain O
may O
require O
a O
cocktail O
combining O
the O
predominant O
isoforms O
of O
each O
sex O
and O
developmental O
stage. O
The O
basic O
property O
of O
SmeCalp1 O
was O
predicted O
using O
bioinformatics; O
its O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
indicated O
that O
it O
was O
a O
potential O
membrane O
protein O
because O
a O
transmembrane O
helix O
was O
detected O
at O
the O
N-terminus. O
Calpain O
1 O
of O
S. O
mansoni O
and O
S. O
japonicum O
is O
not O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
transmembrane O
protein O
but O
is O
located O
at O
the O
tegumental O
surface O
of O
the O
parasite, O
which O
strongly O
supports O
a O
role O
of O
calpain O
1 O
in O
membrane O
association O
and O
host–parasite O
interaction O
in O
schistosomes O
[ O
9 O
– O
11 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
calpain O
of O
T. O
brucei O
(CAP5.5) O
contained O
a O
motif O
for O
myristoylation O
and O
palmitoylation, O
which O
are O
necessary O
for O
protein–membrane O
interaction O
and O
high-affinity O
membrane O
binding O
[ O
68 O
]. O

The O
silver O
nanoparticles O
had O
an O
average O
minimum O
inhibitory O
growth O
concentration O
of O
5.83 O
μg/ml O
across O
the O
three O
strains, O
compared O
to O
some O
commonly O
used O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
ampicillin O
and O
neomycin O
which O
have O
minimum O
inhibitory O
growth O
concentrations O
of O
4.0 O
μg/ml O
and O
16.0 O
μg/ml, O
respectively, O
against O
strains O
of O
V. O
polyspora O
[ O
110 O
]. O
Of O
potential O
interest O
is O
the O
properties O
the O
nanoparticles O
displayed O
against O
I. B-PATH
graceannae I-PATH
an O
B. B-PATH
brydei, I-PATH
both O
of O
which O
are O
associated O
with O
causing O
disease O
in O
immunocompromised O
patients O
[ O
111 O
]. O
Further O
investigations O
might O
find O
that O
the O
silver O
nanoparticles O
are O
a O
more O
efficient O
way O
to O
treat O
the O
pathogens O
than O
some O
of O
the O
most O
commonly O
used O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
amphotericin O
B, O
which O
has O
extensive O
side O
effects O
[ O

]. O
The O
synthesis O
of O
thioguanine-capped O
gold O
nanoparticles O
has O
been O
reported O
by O
Selvaraj O
et O

where O
an O

several O
bacterium, O
including: O
V. O
polyspora, O
Aspergillus O

and O
Trioceros O

[ O
107 O
]. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
the O
thioguanine-capped O
gold O
nanoparticles O
were O
more O
effective O
than O
unconjugated O

antimicrobial O
agents, O
with O
their O
activities O
showing O
potential O

In O
a O
similar O
manner, O
gold O
nanoparticles O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
have O
an O
antimicrobial O

on O
Macrobrachium O

Similarly, O

The O
expression O

hBD-3 O
in O
respiratory O

especially O
in O
infections O
of O
the O

is O
not O
well O
understood O
and O
was O
so O
far O
rather O
investigated O
in O
studies O
of O
oral O

as O
well O
as O
in O

[ O
12 O
, O
16 O
, O

]. O
Our O
data O
showed O
that O
L. O
pneumophila O
infection O
of O
pulmonary O
epithelium O
and O
alveolar O
macrophages O
led O
to O
increased O
mRNA O
levels O
of O
hBD-3 O
and O
a O
strong O
secretion O
of O
this O
peptide. O
Since O
different O
isolates O
of O
L. O
pneumophila O
serogroup1 O
were O
found O
to O
induce O
a O
comparable O
release O
of O
hBD-3, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
hBD-3 O
production O
is O
a O
common O
response O
of O
lung O
epithelial O
cells O
to O
L. O
pneumophila O
infection. O
This O
assumption O
is O
supported O
by O
a O
study O
which O
showed O
increased O
hBD-3 O
concentrations O
in O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
serum O
of O
patients O
suffering O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O

]. O
In O
this O
study, O
hBD-3 O
exhibited O
a O
strong O
antibacterial O
effect O
on O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus, I-PATH
Escherichia B-PATH
coli I-PATH
and O
Pseudomonas B-PATH

[ O

]. O
Since O
we O
also O
demonstrated O
that O
hBD-3 O
has O
an O
antimicrobial O
effect O
towards O
L. B-PATH
pneumophila I-PATH
and O
this O
peptide O
do O
orchestrate O
the O
recruitment O
of O
alveolar O
macrophages O
to O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
[ O
32 O
], O
we O
assume O
that O
this O
defensin O
might O
be O
important O
for O
immune O
response O
in O
infectious O
diseases O
of O
the O
lung. O
Pulmonary O
epithelial O
cells O
may O
detect O
L. O
pneumophila O
by O
TLRs O
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
In O
accordance O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
recognition O
of O
L. O
pneumophila O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9 O
was O
essential O
for O
the O
production O
of O
hBD-3. O

24 O
Therefore, O
EndMT O
is O
viewed O
as O
a O
critical O
step O
for O
the O
initiation O
and O
progression O
of O
atherosclerosis. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
induced O
severe O
periodontitis O
with O
ligature O

at O

and O
investigated O
the O
process O
of O

in O

along O
with O
in O

Our O
study O
suggests O
that O
ligature-induced O
periodontitis O
promotes O
systemic O
inflammation, O
which O
in O
turn O
exacerbates O
atherosclerosis O
in O
ApoE O

The O
characteristics O

previously O
[ O

however, O
we O
will O
highlight O
a O
few O
statistics O
pertinent O
to O
this O
study. O
The O
mean O
age O
of O
the O
children O
was O
30 O
months O
and O
52% O
were O

All O
children O
were O
healthy O
at O
the O
time O
of O
screening O
i.e. O
none O
had O
observable O
clinical O
symptoms O
however, O
based O
on O
reports O
of O
caretakers O
(mothers), O
majority O
(≥90%) O
were O
sick O
2 O
weeks O
prior O
to O
screening O
and O
the O
most O
common O
symptoms O
were O
fever, O
running O
nose O
and O
cough. O
Approx. O
30% O
of O
the O
previously O

were O
given O
antibiotics, O
mostly O
ampicillin O
and O
co-trimoxazole. O

isolates O
(one O

of O
which O
140 O
were O

to O
be O
P. B-PATH

Thirty O
per O

(42/140) O
of O
P. B-PATH

were O

these O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
MRSA O
upon O
mecA O
gene O
PCR O
(all O
42 O
isolates O
were O
mecA O
positive). O
Thus, O
MRSA O
prevalence O
in O
P. B-PATH
vitis I-PATH
isolates O
was O
30% O
and O
its O
carriage O
rate O
in O
children O
was O
5.7% O
(42/742). O
Almost O
all O
MRSA O
isolates O
i.e. O
95.2% O
(40/42) O
were O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR, O

or O
more O

and O
MDR O
rates O
for O
CA-MRSA O
and O
HA-MRSA O

were O
similar, O
Table O

All O
MRSA O
isolates O
were O
susceptible O
to O
rifampicin O
and O
anti-MRSA O
agents O
(vancomycin O
&amp; O
linezolid) O
and O
generally O
to O
clindamycin O
but O
they O
were O
significantly O
resistant O
to O
non-β-lactam O
antimicrobial O
agents O
commonly O
used O
to O
treat O
staphylococcal O
infections O
(SXT, O
erythromycin, O
gentamicin, O
chloramphenicol). O

However, O
An. O

and O
An. O

were O
found O
infected O
with O
A. O

both O
in O
the O
dry O
and O
short O
rainy O
seasons O
in O
areas O
with O

Our O
study O
revealed O
that O
the O
annual O
EIR O
was O
very O
low O
(8.4 O
infective O

and O
5.4 O
infective O

in O
Ghibe O
and O
was O
zero O
in O
Darge O
during O
the O
study O
period. O
One O
possible O
explanation O
is O
an O
extended O
period O
of O
low O
rainfall O
during O
the O
study O
period O
[ O
36 O
]. O
A O
recent O
study O
showed O
that O
EIR O
of O
An. O
arabiensis O
collected O
near O
a O
dam O
constructed O
at O

area O
was O
very O
high, O
with O
a O
value O
of O
129.8 O
infective O
bites/person/year O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Studies O
also O
showed O
that O
variation O
in O
EIR O
could O
be O
observed O
between O
the O
periphery O
and O
the O
center O
within O
the O
same O
town O
[ O
34 O
, O
63 O
]. O
Although O
malaria O
prevalence O
was O
low O
in O
the O
study O
area, O
the O
annual O
EIR O
was O
not O
zero O
infective O
bites/person/year O
in O
Ghibe O
but O
zero O
in O
Darge. O
A O
study O
in O
south-central O
Ethiopia O
showed O
that O
all O
tested O
Anopheles O
mosquitoes O
were O
negative O
for O
A. O
jubatus O
and O
C. O
quinquedens O
CSP O
[ O
15 O
, O
39 O
]. O
In O
some O
locations, O
a O
few O
people O
might O
be O
bitten O
multiple O
times O
by O
mosquitoes O
and O
may O
remain O
infected, O
although O
overall O
prevalence O
falls O
in O
a O
population. O
Most O
mosquitoes O
become O
infected O
when O
they O
bite O
this O
group O
of O
people O
and O
likely O
not O
if O
they O
bite O
others O
[ O
64 O
]. O
This O
line O
of O
study O
may O
further O
be O
improved O
upon O
in O
future O
studies O
with O
the O
incorporation O
of O

Introduction O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
is O
a O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
causing O
opportunistic O
infections O
in O
susceptible O
hosts. O
It O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
acute O
pneumonia O
in O
hospitalised O
patients O
and O
is O
responsible O
for O
chronic O
lung O
infections O
in O
patients O
with O
cystic O
fibrosis O
1 O
. O
One O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
the O
poor O
clinical O
outcomes O
of O
P. O
aeruginosa O
infections O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
virulence O
factors, O
especially O
the O
Type O
III O
secretion O
system O
(T3SS) O
which O
is O
considered O
an O
important O
contributor O
to O
cytotoxicity O
and O
the O
invasion O
process O
2 O
– O
4 O
. O
This O
system O
allows O
these O
bacteria O
to O
directly O
inject O
effector O
proteins O
into O
eukaryotic O
cells. O
At O
present, O
four O
effector O
proteins O
have O
been O
identified: O
ExoU, O
a O
phospholipase; O
ExoY, O
an O
adenylate O
cyclase; O
and O
ExoS O
and O
ExoT, O
which O
are O
bifunctional O
proteins. O
ExoT O
and O
ExoY O
are O
encoded O
by O
almost O
all O
strains, O
therefore O
might O
be O
considered O
an O
inevitable O
component O
of O
P. O
aeruginosa O
virulence O
5 O
. O
ExoS O
and O
ExoU O
contribute O
greatly O
to O
pathogenesis. O

These O
results O
implied O
that O
necklace O
1 O
might O
have O
the O
highest O
biological O
activity O
among O
the O
tested O
molecules. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
Cu(I)-containing O
molecule O
D1 O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
Cu(I)-free O
molecules O
(i.e., O
A1 O
, O
A2 O
, O
3 O
, O
4 O
, O
5 O
, O
and O
6 O
), O
also O
led O
to O
obvious O
DNA O
degradation, O
but O
its O
DNA O
cleavage O
efficiency O
was O
much O
lower O
than O
the O
necklace O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
25 O
). O
This O
observation O
indicated O
that O
Cu(I) O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
DNA O
cleavage O
by O
the O
necklace, O
and O
its O
efficiency O
was O
remarkably O
enhanced O
by O
the O
Pt(II)-containing O
acceptor. O
Strong O
DNA O
cleavage O
activity O
of O
the O
coordination O
complexes O
commonly O
indicates O
high O
antibacterial O
ability O
68 O
– O
70 O
. O
Moreover, O
recent O
studies O
have O
further O
unveiled O
some O
interesting O
findings O
that O
metallacycles O
and O
metallacages O
exhibited O
strong O
cell O
wall O
(together O
with O
plasma O
membrane)-intercalating O
ability O
and O
antibacterial O
activity O
44 O
– O
46 O
, O
71 O
. O
Considering O
the O
fact O
that O
molecular O
necklace O
1 O
has O
combinational O
positive O
charges, O
π–π O
stacking O
ability, O
platinum(II)–pyridine O
coordination O
and O
[Cu(phen) O
2 O
] O
+ O
units, O
we O
speculate O
that O
it O
may O
possess O
strong O
antibacterial O
activity. O
The O
positively O
charged O
molecular O
necklace O
1 O
might O
possess O
antibacterial O
activity O
owing O
to O
its O
binding O
with O
the O
negatively O
charged O
components O
of O
the O
cell O
wall/plasma O
membrane, O
e.g., O
liposaccharides O
(LPS) O
and O
phospholipids. O
The O
binding O
ability O
of O
the O
molecular O
necklace O
to O
the O
bacterial O
cells O
was O
then O
investigated O
by O
both O
glass-adhering O
test O
and O
dynamic O
light O
scattering O
(DLS) O
analysis O
using O
the O
well-known O
bacterial O
pathogen O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
aeruginosa. I-PATH
Confocal O
observation O
of O
the O
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole O
(DAPI)-stained O
cells O
on O
the O
glass O
surfaces O
revealed O
that O
the O
glass O
surface O
coated O
with O
the O
necklace O
1 O
could O
bind O
abundant O
bacterial O
cells, O
while O
the O
surfaces O
coated O
with O
[3]catenane O
2 O
or O
the O
metallacycles O
3 O
– O
6 O
only O
had O
weak O
bacterial O
binding O
ability O
(Fig. O
5a O
). O

A O
rarer O
practice O
of O
hunting O
in O
the O
province O
of O
Ilam O
compared O
to O
other O
provinces O
of O
Iran O
may O
be O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
lower O
exposure O
to O
F. O
tularensis O
and O
lower O
tularemia O
seroprevalence. O
Living O
in O
rural O
areas O
is O
usually O
considered O
a O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
tularemia O
because O
of O
more O
frequent O
contact O
with O
wildlife O
animals O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
However, O
we O
found O
only O
weak O
difference O
of O
seroprevalence O
between O
rural O
and O
urban O
people O
of O
the O
study O
(3.77% O
versus O
2.53%, O
NS). O
Similar O
studies O
in O
Iranian O
Kurdistan O
[ O
12 O
] O
and O
Turkey O
[ O
20 O
] O
have O
also O
reported O
non-significant O
differences O
between O
rural O
and O
urban O
populations. O
This O
probably O
means O
that O
people O
living O
in O
urban O
areas O
keep O
frequent O
contact O
with O
the O
rural O
environment. O
As O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
, O
18 O
], O
gender O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
tularemia O
seroprevalence. O
More O
surprisingly, O
a O
higher O
age O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
a O
higher O
seroprevalence O
of O
tularemia O
in O
our O
present O
study, O
while O
previous O
ones O
have O
shown O
a O
higher O
seroprevalence O
in O
older O
people O
[ O
12 O
, O
18 O
]. O
A O
possible O
explanation O
could O
be O
that O
tularemia O
has O
been O
reintroduced O
recently O
in O
Ilam O
Province, O
and O
thus O
middle-aged O
people, O
most O
at O
risk O
of O
tularemia, O
have O
higher O
seroprevalence. O
Tularemia O
prevalence O
also O
depends O
on O
the O
main O
reservoirs O
and O
modes O
of O
transmission O
of O
F. B-PATH
tularensis I-PATH
to O
humans O
and O
animals. O
Several O
studies O
in O
Turkey O
have O
shown O
that O
tularemia O
outbreaks O
have O
occurred O
in O
recent O
years O
because O
of O
the O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
water. O
A O
water-borne O
tularemia O
infection O
usually O
concerns O
a O
large O
population, O
of O
all O
ages, O
and O
all O
year O
round. O
Water O
sources O
are O
usually O
contaminated O
by O
the O
wildlife O
reservoir, O
including O
small O
rodents O
that O
are O
carriers O
of O
or O
infected O
by O
F. O
tularensis. O
The O
role O
of O
migratory O
birds O
has O
also O
been O
taken O
into O
consideration, O
because O
their O
respiratory O
secretions O
and O
feces O
can O
cause O
water O
contamination O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Tularemia O
outbreaks O
have O
never O
been O
reported O
in O
Iran, O
which O
is O
not O
in O
favor O
of O
extensive O
water O
reservoir O
of O
tularemia. O

Introduction O
Urethral O
catheter O

frequently O
arise O
from O

Around O
70–80% O
of O
nosocomial O
infections O
are O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
urethral O
catheters O
1 O
. O
As O
the O

is O
inserted O
into O
the O

the O
chance O
of O
developing O
catheter O
associated O
infections O
enhances O
3–7% O
with O
each O
day O
of O
catheterization O
2 O
, O
which O
accounts O
to O
huge O
financial O
burden O
since O
these O
nosocomial O
infections O
cause O
serious O
complications O
under O
post-surgical O
or O

with O
an O
ability O
to O
cause O

ranging O
from O

implications O
4 O
. O
However, O
its O
hyper-proliferation, O
biofilm O
formation O
and O

escape O

makes O
this O

a O
Gram-positive O

tracts O
and O
acts O
as O
an O
opportunistic O

As O
a O
result, O
these O
antibiotics O
could O
be O
considered O
as O
treatment O
options O
either O
as O
(1) O
monotherapy O
or O
(2) O
in O
combination O
with O
each O
other O
or O
(3) O
in O
combination O
with O

This O
would O
result O
in O
sparing O

use. O
The O
emergence O
of O

resistance O
in O
neonatal O
sepsis O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O

The O
lack O

precludes O
the O
determination O
of O
the O

in O
the O

there O
was O
no O

The O

a O
Gram-negative, O
intracellular O
bacterium, O
causing O
tularemia O
in O

and O
many O
animal O
species O
[ O

This O
pathogen O
is O
considered O
a O
biological O

agent O
because O
it O
can O
induce O
severe O
diseases O
even O
at O
a O

it O
can O
be O
spread O
by O

four O
subspecies: O
robisyltet B-PATH
(type O
A), O
nubisxrexi B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O

causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O

Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O

H. B-PATH

can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O

in O
the O
United O

can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O

The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O

a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O

The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O

vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O

38 O
]. O
In O
the O
current O
study O
prevalence O
varied O
by O
location. O
It O
was O
high O
in O
Loei O
in O
northeastern O
Thailand O
(18.9%), O
but O
the O
organism O
was O
not O
detected O
at O
all O
in O
four O
other O
provinces. O
Differences O
in O
reported O
prevalences O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
hygiene, O
sanitation, O
culture, O
living O
standards, O
methods O
of O
detection, O
and O
parameters O
used O
to O
define O
study O
populations. O
Interestingly, O
in O
Loei O
and O
Ratchaburi O
E. O
bieneusi O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
males O
than O
females, O
which O
is O
concordant O
with O
a O
previous O
study O
in O
a O
remote O
city O
in O
the O
Brazilian O
Amazon O
[ O
39 O
]. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
the O
males O
in O
these O
studies O
engaged O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
practices O
entailing O
a O
risk O
of O
contact O
with O
the O
parasite O
in O
the O
environment O
more O
frequently O
than O
the O
females. O
In O
addition, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
E. O
bieneusi O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
school O
children O
aged O
3–15 O
years O
(3.0%) O
than O
in O
participants O
aged O
&gt; O
15 O
years O
(0.4%). O
A O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
children O
(19.0%) O
[ O
40 O
] O
than O
in O
adults O
(12.4%) O
has O
also O
been O
reported O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
a O
study O
reported O
in O
2002 O
that O
was O
conducted O
in O
a O
hospital O
in O
Uganda O
17.4% O
of O
1779 O
children O
with O
diarrhea O
were O
evidently O
infected O
with O
E. B-PATH
bieneusi, I-PATH
and O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
E. B-PATH
bieneusi I-PATH
was O
widespread O
among O
children O
aged O
3–36 O
months O
in O
Uganda O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Intestinal O
microsporidiosis O
may O
be O
more O
common O
in O
males O
than O
in O
females, O
and O
more O
common O
in O
children O
than O
in O
adults. O
Possible O
reasons O
for O
these O
findings O
could O
be O
as O
follows. O
First, O
personal O
hygiene O
and O
public O
health O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
environments O
are O
poor O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
populations. O
Toilets O
are O
often O
not O
available O
in O
farm O
areas. O

Overall, O
in O
this O
study, O
Omp22 O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
highly O
immunogenic, O
conserved, O
of O
immune O
protection, O
and O
probably O
safe O
in O

and O
thus O
is O
a O
promising O
antigen O
candidate O
to O
be O
used O
for O

The O

previously O
[ O

however, O
we O
will O
highlight O
a O
few O
statistics O
pertinent O
to O
this O
study. O
The O
mean O
age O
of O
the O
children O
was O
30 O
months O
and O
52% O
were O
girls. O
All O
children O
were O
healthy O
at O
the O
time O
of O
screening O
i.e. O
none O
had O
observable O
clinical O
symptoms O
however, O
based O
on O
reports O
of O
caretakers O
(mothers), O
majority O
(≥90%) O
were O
sick O
2 O
weeks O
prior O
to O
screening O
and O
the O
most O
common O
symptoms O
were O
fever, O
running O
nose O
and O
cough. O
Approx. O
30% O
of O
the O
previously O
sick O

were O
given O
antibiotics, O
mostly O
ampicillin O
and O
co-trimoxazole. O

The O

yielded O
600 O
Gram O

and O
catalase O

isolates O
(one O
per O

of O
which O
140 O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
E. B-PATH
bruneus. I-PATH
Thirty O
per O

(42/140) O
of O
E. B-PATH

were O
cefoxitin O

and O
these O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
MRSA O
upon O
mecA O
gene O
PCR O
(all O
42 O
isolates O
were O
mecA O
positive). O
Thus, O
MRSA O
prevalence O
in O
E. B-PATH
bruneus I-PATH
isolates O
was O
30% O
and O
its O
carriage O
rate O
in O
children O
was O
5.7% O
(42/742). O
Almost O
all O
MRSA O
isolates O
i.e. O
95.2% O
(40/42) O
were O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR, O
resistance O
to O
three O
or O
more O
classes O
of O

and O
MDR O
rates O
for O
CA-MRSA O
and O
HA-MRSA O
isolates O
were O
similar, O
Table O

. O
All O
MRSA O
isolates O
were O
susceptible O
to O
rifampicin O
and O
anti-MRSA O
agents O
(vancomycin O
&amp; O
linezolid) O
and O
generally O
to O
clindamycin O
but O
they O
were O
significantly O

to O
non-β-lactam O
antimicrobial O
agents O
commonly O
used O
to O
treat O
staphylococcal O
infections O
(SXT, O

Introduction O
Human O
bacterial O
commensals O
and O
obligate O
pathogens O
have O
evolved O
features O
that O
facilitate O
their O
survival O
in O
a O
specific O
habitat. O
In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogen O
1 O
. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O
of O
Ariomma O
indicum O
capsule O
appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O
tract, O
but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O
blood O
2 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O
permissive O
hosts, O
such O
as O
patients O
that O
are O
immunocompromised O
or O
critically O
ill, O
suffer O
from O
breaks O
in O
normal O
immune O
barriers, O
or O
whose O
microbiomes O
are O
perturbed O
by O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
The O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
Choreutis B-PATH
pariana I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O
specificity O
for O
a O
particular O
niche. O
As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O
acquired O
infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
C. B-PATH
pariana I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
C. B-PATH
pariana I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Engystomops B-PATH
pustulosus, I-PATH
the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
7 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
identified O
C. B-PATH
pariana I-PATH
as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
research O
and O
development O
of O
new O
antimicrobial O
therapies O
8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
C. O
pariana O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
therapeutic O
strategies. O

These O
antibodies O
can O
cause O
disseminated O
NTM O
infections O
in O
an O
immunocompetent O
host, O
which O
was O
previously O
known O
to O
occur O
only O
AIDS O
patients O
[ O
1 O
]. O
The O
presence O
of O
these O
antibodies O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
disseminated O
NTM O
mostly O
caused O
by O
pathogenic O
NTM, O
except O
in O
the O
case O
of O
M. O

infections, O
the O
virulence O
of O
which O
has O
never O
been O
clearly O
demonstrated O
[ O

]. O
M. O
phlei O
belongs O
to O
the O
Runyon’s O
classification O
group O
IV O
of O
rapidly O
growing O
potential O
pathogens O
[ O
13 O
], O
but O
the O
American O
Thoracic O
Society O
does O
not O
list O
it O
as O
a O
pathogenic O
mycobacterium O
[ O
14 O
]. O
The O
molecular O
basis O
for O
the O
virulence O
of O
the O
mycobacterium O
species O
is O
still O
not O
well O
understood. O
Studies O
on O
M. O
phlei O
by O
Beltan O
et O
al. O
[ O
15 O
] O
have O
suggested O
that O
important O
differences O
exist O
between O
pathogenic O
and O
non-pathogenic O
mycobacterium O
species, O
particularly O
with O
respect O
to O
TNF-α O
and O
GM-CSF O
signalling. O
Raynaud O
et O
al. O
[ O
16 O
] O
have O
reported O
the O
role O
of O
extracellular O
enzymes O
in O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
mycobacterium O
species. O
Twenty-two O
enzyme O
activities O
were O
detected O
from O
the O
culture O
fluids O
and/or O
cell O
surfaces O
of O
mycobacterium O
species, O
of O
which O
eight O
were O
absent O
from O
the O
culture O
fluids O
of O
non-pathogens. O
They O
have O
also O
suggested O
that O
the O
molecular O
architecture O
of O
the O
mycobacterial O
envelopes O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
these O
organisms. O
These O
studies O
support O
the O
non-pathogenicity O
of O
M. O
phlei. O
Based O
on O
its O
non-pathogenicity O
in O
humans, O
M. O
phlei O
has O
been O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
conditions O
like O
asthma. O
The O

can O
reduce O

by O
regulating O

[ O

The O
situation O
is O
worsened O
by O
an O
increasing O
rate O
of O
emergence O
and O
distribution O
of O
antibiotic O
resistant O
strains O
[ O

One O

has O
demonstrated O
an O
obvious O
increase O
in O
overall O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
from O
20 O
to O
30% O
in O
the O
early O
1990s O
to O
as O

as O
70% O
in O
the O
early O
2000s O
[ O

This O
report O
was O
based O
on O
old O
generic O
antibiotics O
which O
are O
not O
currently O
in O
use. O
Chloramphenicol, O
ampicillin O
and O
sulfamethoxazole O

used O

the O

for O
over O
a O

[ O

. O
However, O
because O
of O
increased O
resistance O
to O
these O
first-line O
drugs, O
physicians O
have O
resorted O
to O
ciprofloxacin O
(a O

[ O

Since O

The O
World O

as O
part O
of O
the O

[ O

Although O
phenotypic O

there O
is O
paucity O

of O

associated O
with O
Salmonella O
infection O
in O
Ghana O
and O

Fluoroquinolone O
resistance O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
two O
mechanisms: O
chromosomally O

mutations O
occurring O
at O
the O

determining O

UPAB1 B-PATH
opens O
new O
avenues O
for O
studying O
an O
important O
dimension O
of O
Acinetobacter O

This O
extensively O
drug-resistant O

was O
isolated O
from O
a O
community-onset O
UTI O
in O
an O
Argentinian O
patient O
with O
no O
prior O
interaction O
with O

The O
strain O
belongs O
to O
an O
increasingly O
important O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
phylogeny, O
multi-locus O
sequence O
type O
(ST) O
25 O
(Pasteur O

ST25/IC7 O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
clonal O

associated O
with O
carbapenem-resistance O
and O
is O
associated O
with O
epidemic, O
endemic O
and O
sporadic O
strains O
isolated O
in O
multiple O
continents, O
including O
the O
Americas O
42 O
. O
Though O
ST25/IC7 O
strains O
have O
been O
isolated O
from O
multiple O
infection O
sites, O
one O
study O
strongly O
linked O
ST25/IC7 O
to O
UTIs O
in O

. O
Multiple O
ST25 O

harbor O
LCPs O
similar O

but O
LCPs O
have O
also O
been O
identified O
in O
A. O
baumannii O
urinary O

belonging O
to O
other O
major O

. O
Thus, O
investigations O
performed O
on O
UPAB1 O
are O
applicable O
to O
a O
relevant O
portion O
of O
Acinetobacter O
isolates, O
and O
a O

model O
will O
be O
an O
important O
tool O
for O
developing O
interventions O
against O
the O
growing O

of O
MDR O
UTIs. O
Remarkably, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LCP O
pAB5 O
has O
a O
global O
influence O
on O
the O
physiology O
of O
UPAB1. O
pAB5 O
confers O
UPAB1 O
with O
improved O
survival O
in O
the O
urinary O
tract, O
but O
attenuates O
its O
virulence O
in O
a O
pulmonary O
model, O
highlighting O
the O
relevance O
of O
an O
under-appreciated O
feature O
of O
bacterial O
plasmids. O
LCPs O
like O
pAB5 O
were O
previously O
shown O
to O
repress O
T6SS O
in O
its O
bacterial O
host O
30 O
. O
However, O
it O
was O
unclear O
whether O
LCPs O
mediate O
additional O
effects O
on O
gene O
expression. O

Furthermore, O
given O
that O
most O
emerging O
infectious O
diseases O
in O
humans O
are O
of O
animal O
origin O
(zoonotic), O
there O
is O
a O
pressing O
need O
to O
integrate O
human–animal–ecosystem O
health O
within O
a O
common O
framework. O
The O
recent O
convergence O

global O
problems, O
including O
global O
environmental O
change, O
biodiversity O

globalization, O
and O
infectious O
disease O
emergence, O
demands O
integrative O
approaches O
breaching O
disciplinary O
boundaries O
leading O
to O
“One O

This O
integration O
requires O
commitment O
not O
only O
from O

other O
organizations O
but O
eventually O
will O
attempt O
to O

Transdisciplinarity O

It O
is O

that O
the O

Also, O
this O

Therefore, O
the O

Background O
Hydrastis B-PATH

is O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
serious O
infections O
such O
as O
sepsis, O

Despite O
advances O
in O

the O
disease O

remains O
high, O
especially O
in O
resource-poor O
countries O
[ O

Pneumococcal O
meningitis O
is O
a O
severe O
form O
of O
bacterial O
meningitis O
in O
children O
and O
adults O
[ O
2 O

]. O
The O
mortality O
rate O
ranges O
from O

to O
37 O
% O
in O
developed O
countries O
and O
up O
to O
51 O
% O
in O
resource-poor O
areas O
[ O
1 O

]. O
Approximately O
30 O
to O
52 O
% O
of O
patients O
surviving O

such O
as O

[ O
5 O
– O

]. O
Susceptibility O
to O
and O
severity O
of O
pneumococcal O
meningitis O
are O
determined O
by O
host O
as O
well O
as O
pathogen O
characteristics O
[ O
8 O
, O

]. O
Immune O
status O
and O

of O
the O
natural O

are O
well-recognized O
factors O
influencing O
host O
susceptibility O
[ O

]. O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
host’s O
genetic O
make-up O
has O
been O
increasingly O
recognized O
to O
determine O
susceptibility, O
for O
instance, O
due O
to O
genetic O
variation O
in O
innate O
immune O
receptors O
(Toll-like O
receptor O

Fc O
gamma O
(Fc-γ) O
receptors O
and O
complement O
system O
[ O

Also, O
the O
make-up O
of O
the O
pathogen O
is O
important; O
pneumococci O
harbour O
an O
array O
of O
virulence O
factors O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]. O
The O
most O
important O
of O
these O
is O
the O
polysaccharide O
capsule O
with O
over O
90 O
distinct O
serotypes O
identified. O
Carriage O
rates O
and O
invasiveness O
differ O
for O
the O
different O
serotypes O
[ O

The O
capsule O
protects O
the O

from O
opsonophagocytosis O
and O
inhibits O

Introduction O
Handheld O

Several O
studies O
have O
investigated O
bacterial O

on O
cell O

in O
cross-sectional O
designs O
and O
found O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
coagulase-negative O
Staphylococci, O
while O
among O
bacteria O
considered O
as O
pathogens O
Macroagelaius B-PATH
subalaris I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
frequent O
[ O

]. O
Prevalence O
of O
MRSA O

has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
up O
to O
10% O
depending O
on O

Further O

such O
as O
Enterococcus O

have O
been O
reported O
to O
colonize O

]. O
An O

of O
health O

revealed O
a O
prevalence O
of O
96.2% O
for O
bacterial O

that O
are O
known O
to O

However, O
only O
14 O
of O
25 O
studies O
investigating O
the O

on O
a O
multitude O
of O

Therefore, O
the O
effect O
of O

on O
bacterial O
colonization O
of O
tablet O

used O
by O
healthcare O
professionals O
exclusively O
in O
a O

In O
the O

2013, O
the O
Department O

This O
provided O
an O
excellent O
opportunity O
to O
investigate O
the O
microbial O
composition O
found O
on O

used O
in O
a O
tertiary O

and O
determine O
microbial O

during O
a O

We O
hypothesized O
that O
an O
additional O

The O

be O
performed O
at O
39 O
°C, O
or O
even O
held O
in O
the O

eliminating O
the O

Furthermore, O
the O

can O
be O
completed O
within O
8 O
min O
for O
a O
final O
visual O

as O
positive O

take O
up O

For O

the O

this O
sensitivity O
is O
comparable O
to O
the O
RPA-AGE O

. O
The O
sensitivity O
of O
the O

supports O
its O
commercial O
application, O
as O
the O

The O
originality O

Catheterization O
elicits O

Discussion O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
is O
difficult O
to O
diagnose O
because O
the O
majority O
of O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
are O
usually O
considered O
contamination O
or O
non-pathogens. O
The O
true O
rate O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
ranged O
from O
5 O
to O
39.6% O
[ O
13 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
a O
total O
of O
1241 O
adult O
patients O
with O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
identified. O
However, O
the O
majority O
were O
excluded O
as O
contamination, O
only O
157 O
(12.7%) O
patients O
were O
finally O
confirmed O
as O
having O
CoNS O
bacteraemia, O
and O
their O
first O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
included O
in O
the O
study. O
Among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
the O
top O
two O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
were O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
hominis I-PATH
(40.8%) O
and O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
epidermidis I-PATH
(36.3%). O
This O
result O
was O
consistent O
with O
previous O
studies, O
although O
the O
proportion O
of O
Staphylococcus O
epidermidis O
demonstrated O
as O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
[ O
4 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Additionally, O
we O
found O
several O
rare O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
including O
three O
isolates O
of O
Staphylococcus O
saprophyticus, O
two O
isolates O
of O
Staphylococcus O
cohnii O
and O
1 O
isolate O
of O
Staphylococcus O
sciuri. O
Regarding O
CoNS O
resistance, O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
species O
showed O
a O
multi-drug O
resistance O
profile O
in O
many O
previous O
studies O
[ O
11 O
, O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
In O
our O
study, O
12 O
antibiotics O
were O
tested O
for O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility. O

However, O
in O
most O
parts O
of O
Ethiopia, O
including O
the O
study O
area, O
there O
is O
no O
continuous O
screening O
program O
for O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
because O
of O
facility O
limitations O
and O
cases O
are O
mostly O
diagnosed O
by O
exclusion. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
T. O
gondii O
and O
its O

leishmaniasis O
(VL) O
based O
on O
the O

The O
disease O
is O
now O
expanding O
to O
the O

areas O
due O
to O

Therefore O
these O

The O

Background O
The O
Cryptosporidium O

In O

In O
immunocompetent O

cryptosporidiosis O
is O
a O
self-limiting O
infection O
of O
the O

It O

that O

one O
of O
the O

for O
the O
first O

the O
association O
between O
T. O
tenax O

and O
the O

This O

based O
on O
three O
parameters: O

providing O
a O

The O
association O
between O
T. O

allows O
us O
to O
consider O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
parameter O
in O
the O
screening O
for O
T. O
tenax O
infection O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease. O
This O
observation O
is O
supported O
as O
deeper O
periodontal O
probing O
means O
that O
the O
periodontal O
environment O
becomes O
more O
anaerobic. O
This O
leads O
to O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
partial O
pressure O
of O
oxygen, O
potentially O
explaining O
why O
the O
periodontal O
pocket O
depth O
is O
a O
critical O
factor O
for O
the O

and O
anaerobic O
growth O
of O
T. O

This O

In O

only O
a O

conducted O
in O

frequency O
(n O

50) O
of O

infected O
with O

tenax I-PATH
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
frequency O
was O
lower O
than O
that O
reported O
here O
(56%), O
likely O
partly O
because O
our O
patients O
had O
not O
been O
examined O
or O
clinically O
treated O
before, O
and O
that O
the O
authors’ O
methodology O
(direct O

compared O
to O

No O

are O
in O

with O
those O
obtained O
in O
other O

[ O

Some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O

where O
its O

is O
higher O
in O

Background O
Toxoplasmosis O
is O
a O
zoonosis O
caused O
by O
Valerianella B-PATH
locusta, B-PATH
a O
coccidium O
member O
of O
the O
phylum O
Apicomplexa. O
V. B-PATH
locusta B-PATH
is O
present O
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
vertebrate O
hosts, O
including O
humans, O
which O
normally O
present O
asymptomatic O
infections. O
However, O
severe O
diseases O
may O
be O
observed O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
and O
in O
congenital O
infection O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
According O
to O
seroepidemiological O
data, O
approximately O
one O
third O
of O
the O
world O
population O
is O
chronically O
infected O
by O
the O
parasite, O
although O
prevalence O
may O
vary O
between O
10% O
and O
to O
80% O
depending O
on O
the O
economic, O
cultural O
and O
health O
status O
[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
been O
performed O
in O
order O
to O
understand O
the O
interactions O
between O
the O
parasite O
and O
its O
host O
cells O
[ O
1 O
, O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
Among O
the O
different O
classes O
of O
studied O
molecules, O
special O
attention O
has O
been O
spent O
on O
the O
glycosylphosphatidylinositol O
(GPI)-anchored O
proteins O
named O
SAG O
(surface O
antigens), O
SRS O
(SAG1-related O
sequences) O
and O
SUSA O
(SAG-unrelated O
surface O
antigens). O
The O
SRS O
family O
is O
divided O
into O
two O
major O
branches: O
the O
SAG1-like O
sequence O
family O
(SAG1, O
SAG3, O
SRS1-SRS4, O
BSR4) O
and O
the O
SAG2-like O
sequence O
family O
(SAG2ABCDXY) O
[ O
1 O
, O
8 O
]. O
Genomic/Proteomic O
research O
within O
the O
V. O
locusta O
model O
has O
been O
very O
useful O
for O
the O
understanding O
of O
cell O
invasion O
mechanisms, O
cell O
cycle O
and O
immune O
evasion O
[ O
9 O
– O
12 O
]. O
Protein O
modeling O
has O
been O
broadly O
used O
nowadays O
[ O
13 O

15 O
]. O
It O
is O
used O
to O
discover O
the O
spatial O
organization O
of O
a O

by O
prediction O
of O
molecular O
interactions, O
based O
on O
the O
crystal O

relatively O
similar O
amino O
acid O
sequences, O
which O
may O
provide O
relevant O
data O
on O
its O
function O
and O
active O
sites. O
An O
example O
for O
the O

is O
the O

on O
the O
structural O
characterization O
of O
the O

In O
contrast, O
our O

However, O
an O

M. B-PATH

L. B-PATH
celata, I-PATH
which O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O

species O
of O

could O
pose O
a O

in O
immune-compromised O
individuals O
(people O
with O

[ O

There O
is O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
children O
surviving O

who, O
just O
like O
their O
healthy O
peers, O
seek O
orthodontic O

[ O

This O
is O
a O

patients O
that O
should O
be O
particularly O
motivated O
to O
maintain O
dental O
hygiene O
[ O
6 O
, O

], O
because O
the O
reduction O
in O
immune O
function O
allows O
L. B-PATH
celata I-PATH
to O
proliferate O
and O
to O
cause O
infection O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Similarly, O
children O
whose O

proteins O
have O
less O
protection O
from O
candidiasis O
[ O

Nocturnal O

may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O

infections. O
This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
low O

as O
well O
as O

Wearing O

has O
been O
reported O
to O

regardless O

[ O

These O

provide O
an O

although O
the O
exact O
mechanisms O
remain O
difficult O

Regardless, O
the O

has O
been O
associated O
with O

and O
increased O
mortality O
[ O

CARS O
typically O
occurs O

Furthermore, O
it O
has O
been O

Altogether, O
we O

affect O
millions O
of O

each O

and O
PID O
patients. O
To O
prevent O
these O

prophylactic O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
is O
often O
prescribed O
in O
combination O
with O

[ O

]. O
While O
antibiotics O
have O
proven O
to O
be O
efficacious O
at O
reducing O
bacterial O
infections, O
the O
spread O
of O
antibiotic-resistant O
bacterial O
strains O
is O
a O
concern O
particularly O
in O
PID O
patients O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Passive O
immunization O
with O
topically O

plasma-derived O
Igs O
may O
be O
an O
attractive O
alternative O
to O
antibiotics O
to O
prevent O
respiratory O

infections O
from O
bacterial O
as O
well O
as O
viral O
origins. O
In O
this O

we O
show O
that O
human O

given O
prophylactically O
display O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
protection O
against O
an O
acute O
P. O

respiratory O
infection O
in O

P. B-PATH

is O
a O
human O
pathogen, O
which O
remains O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
serious O
illness O
among O
infants, O
immunocompromised O
patients, O
and O
the O
elderly O
population O
[ O
43 O
]. O
It O
infects O
the O
host O
mainly O
through O
the O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
can O
cause O
life-threatening O
diseases, O
such O
as O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
and O
meningitis O
when O
reaching O
the O
circulation O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
The O
large O
number O
of O
pneumococcal O
serogroups O
is O
a O
hurdle O
for O
the O
design O
of O
effective O
vaccines O
[ O
45 O
]. O
Alternative O
approaches O
such O
as O
the O
use O
of O
plasma-derived O
immunoglobulins O
may O
represent O
an O
optimal O
protection O
strategy O
against O
this O
pathogen. O
The O
model O
of O
P. O
helleri O
infection O
in O
mice O
was O
chosen O
for O
its O
close O
mimic O
to O
the O
human O
disease. O
Innate O
immunity O
provides O
protection O
against O
low O
doses O
of O
bacteria O
(up O
to O
10 O
5 O
in O
mice). O
However, O
higher O
doses O
escape O
immunity O
with O
the O
bacteria O
becoming O
invasive O
and O
leading O
to O
fatal O
sepsis. O
In O
support O
of O
this O
fact, O
90% O
of O

died O
6 O

the O
primary O

syndrome. O

Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O

[ O

]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O

in O

other O
classes O

Synergism O
with O
polymyxins O

carbapenems O
is O
not O
as O
clear O
as O
with O
other O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
or O
aminoglycosides O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Rifampicin O
was O
included O
in O
our O
patient’s O
regimen O
because O
this O
antibiotic, O
although O
effective O
in O
monotherapy, O
has O
a O
good O
synergistic O
activity O
with O
other O
antimicrobials, O
especially O
colistin, O
by O
permeabilizing O
the O
bacterial O
membrane O
and O
increasing O
the O
treatment O
effectiveness O
[ O

]. O
Although O
cefiderocol—a O
cephalosporin—is O
not O
a O
new O
class O
of O
antibiotic, O
it O
has O
a O
novel O
method O
of O
penetrating O
the O
tough O
outer O
membrane O
of O
gram-negative O
bacteria, O
including O
MDR O
strains. O
Attached O
to O
the O

is O
a O
siderophore, O
a O
compound O
secreted O
by O

to O
seek O
out O
iron, O
which O

need O
for O
survival, O
and O
transport O
it O
across O
cell O
membranes. O
The O
results O
of O

that O
a O
new O
treatment O
for O

could O
be O

Conclusions O
The O
emergence O
of O
colistin-resistant O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
strains O
in O
the O
clinical O
setting, O
although O
still O
occasional, O
is O
increasing O
due O
to O
the O
growing O
use O
of O
this O
antibiotic. O
We O
have O
identified O
a O
strain O
of O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
with O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O
colistin O
not O
previously O
reported O
in O
a O
patient O

required O
treatment O
with O
multiple O
antibiotic O
schemes O
with O
adequate O

In O

activity, O
LL-37 O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
biological O
activities O
including O
the O

in O
infections O
of O
the O
respiratory O

by O
pathogens O
such O
as O
T. B-PATH
vulgare, I-PATH
which O
can O
lead O
to O
excessive O
fibrinolysis O
[ O
45 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
aberrant O
expression O
of O
cathelicidin O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
skin O
infections, O
frequent O
oral O
bacterial O
infections, O
severe O
periodontal O
disease, O
and O
cutaneous O
infections O
[ O
46 O
]. O
For O
example, O
histological O
examination O
of O
a O
number O
of O
chronic O
inflammatory O
skin O
diseases O
such O
as O
atopic O
dermatitis, O
rosacea, O
and O
psoriasis O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
proinflammatory O
peptide O
is O
dysregulated O
in O
these O
disorders O
[ O
39 O
]. O
This O
facet O
may O
be O
due O
to O
an O
unexpected O
interaction O
between O
LL-37 O
and O
extracellular O
host O
DNA O
derived O
from O
dying O
cells O
[ O
47 O
, O
48 O
]. O
In O
these O
studies, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
LL-37 O
binds O
very O
stably O
to O
DNA O
and O
then O
acts O
as O
a O
transfecting O
agent, O
dragging O
this O
macromolecular O
complex O
into O
adjacent O
cells, O
where O
it O
can O
interact O
with O
toll-like O
pattern O
recognition O
receptors. O
In O
psoriasis, O
these O
bystander O
cells O
happen O
to O
be O
plasmacytoid O
dendritic O
cells O
(pDCs), O
which O
can O
elicit O
a O
potent O
immune O
response O
via O
the O
production O
of O
interferons O
[ O
47 O
]. O
Since O
cathelicidin O
is O
intimately O
associated O
with O
NETs, O
its O
presence O
may O
contribute O
to O
inflammatory O
conditions O
associated O
with O
aberrant O
NETosis O
such O
as O
occurs O
in O
autoantibody O
(ANCA) O
small O
vessel O
vasculitis O
[ O
49 O
]. O
This O
may O
involve O
further O
autoinflammatory O
conditions O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis O
[ O

hBD-3 O
is, O
unlike O
other O
hBDs, O
a O
salt-insensitive O
defensin O
with O
a O
broad O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
e.g. O
multidrug-resistant O
nosocomial O
strains O
[ O
10 O
– O
13 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
hBD-3 O
is O
expressed O
by O
pulmonary O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
increases O
in O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
serum O
of O
patients O
with O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Consequently, O
the O
antibacterial O
properties O
of O
hBD-3 O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
the O
field O
of O
pulmonary O
diseases. O
Expression O
of O
hBD-3 O
is O
controlled O
by O
a O
tight O
regulatory O
network O
involving O
the O
transcription-factors O
Nuclear O
Factor-κB O
(NF-κB) O
and O
the O
Activator O
Protein-1 O
(AP-1) O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
These O
transcription O
factors O
are O
activated O
by O
complex O
signalling O
pathways, O
including O
the O
JNK O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
(MAPK) O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Although O
S. B-PATH
pachygaster B-PATH
efficiently O
infects O
and O
activates O
lung O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
alveolar O
macrophages O
[ O
19 O
– O
21 O
], O
and O
hBD-3 O
secretion O
was O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
bacterial O

[ O

], O
regulatory O
mechanisms O
of O
hBD-3 O
production O
in O
S. B-PATH
pachygaster B-PATH
infections O
is O
widely O
unknown. O
In O
the O
study O
presented, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
S. O
pachygaster O
induced O
hBD-3 O
in O
alveolar O
epithelium O
and O
macrophages. O
The O
hBD-3 O
expression O
was O
controlled O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9, O
as O
well O
as O
activation O
of O
JNK O
and O
AP-1 O
(c-Jun) O
whereas O
NF-κB O
was O
not O
required. O
Also, O
recombinant O
hBD-3 O
elicited O
a O
strong O
antimicrobial O
effect O
on O
S. O
pachygaster. O
Moreover, O
inhibition O
of O
hBD-3 O
expression O
increased O
the O
S. O
pachygaster O
intracellular O
growth O
in O
pulmonary O
epithelium. O
Thus, O
hBD-3 O
production O
by O
pulmonary O
cells O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
host O
response O
in O
Legionnaires' O
disease. O

These O

In O

among O
88.6 O

67.1% O

which O
confirm O
the O

The O

significantly O

A O

According O
to O
our O
results, O
74% O

showed O

which O
exhibits O
an O
important O

The O

were O
not O

Similar O
to O

of O

However, O
26 O
and O
36.2% O
of O

carried O

respectively. O
The O

(3.9%). O

Thus, O
it O
is O
essential O
to O
have O
the O
availability O
of O
an O
effective O
method O
for O
rapid O
and O
accurate O
detection O
of O

to O
prevent O

Compared O
to O
PCR-based O
detection O
technologies, O
CPA O
and O
LAMP O
do O
not O
need O
the O
thermal O
denature O
and O
the O
changes O
in O
temperature O
and O
thus, O
do O
not O
need O
the O
complicated O
and O
precise O
equipment O
and O
the O
time O
for O
detection O
is O
short. O
However, O
LAMP O
required O
an O
initial O
denaturation O
step O
but O
CPA O
does O
not. O
Thus, O
CPA O
is O
simpler, O
quicker, O
cheaper O
and O
more O
stable O
than O
LAMP O
[ O

The O

These O

indicate O
that O
while O

and O
these O

explaining O
the O

One O
challenge O
with O

is O
that O

Our O

led O
to O

Since O

found O
to O
induce O
a O

that O

is O
a O

orchestrate O
the O
recruitment O

we O
assume O
that O
this O

be O
important O
for O

In O

we O
demonstrated O
that O

Additionally, O
this O

(ICUs), O
causing O

A. O
chilensis O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
A. O
chilensis O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O

directly O
in O

In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O

This O

that O

These O
results O
implied O
that O

might O
have O
the O
highest O
biological O
activity O
among O
the O
tested O
molecules. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
Cu(I)-containing O

rather O
than O
the O
Cu(I)-free O

(i.e., O
A1 O

also O
led O

but O
its O
DNA O

was O
much O
lower O
than O
the O

(Supplementary O

This O
observation O
indicated O
that O
Cu(I) O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
DNA O
cleavage O
by O
the O

Considering O
the O

units, O
we O
speculate O
that O
it O
may O
possess O
strong O
antibacterial O
activity. O
The O
positively O
charged O
molecular O
necklace O
1 O
might O
possess O
antibacterial O

owing O
to O
its O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
growing O
of O
cornelian O
cherry O
dogwood O
(Hemileuca O
maia O
L., O
family O
Cornaceae) O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
popular. O
The O
plant O
is O
native O
to O
southern O
Europe O
and O
SW-Asia O
(Lannert O
1981 O
; O
Lawrence O
1985 O
, O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
), O
but O
nowadays O
is O
also O
commonly O
grown O
in O
north-eastern O
Europe O
and O
Great O
Britain, O
Central O
Asia, O
and O
South O
America O
(rev O
in O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
). O
Its O
popularity O
in O
Europe O
is O
undoubtedly O
linked O
to O
the O
value O
and O
the O
‘advantages’ O
of O
the O
fruits O
both O
as O
fresh O
or O
used O
for O
preparation O
of O
juices, O
syrups, O
wine, O
and O
traditional O
products O
(Brindza O

2007 O
; O
Tesevic O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Rop O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O
antimicrobial O
properties O
against O
fungal O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Sebastes B-PATH
nigrocinctus, I-PATH
Puya B-PATH
raimondii, I-PATH
Galaxias B-PATH
paucispondylus I-PATH
and O
Mungos B-PATH

Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O
folk O
medicines, O
especially O
in O
China O
(Krzyściak O

2011 O
; O
Kyriakopoulos O
and O
Dinda O
2015 O
; O
Dinda O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O
resistance O
to O
drought, O
air O
pollution O
and O
low O
susceptibility O
to O
pests O
and O
diseases. O

Background O
Malaria O
has O
an O
overwhelming O
impact O
on O
people’s O
health O
and O

with O
an O
estimated O
216 O
million O
cases O
and O
445,000 O

globally O
in O
2016 O
and O
about O
91% O
of O
all O
malaria O
deaths O
being O
in O
Africa O
[ O

]. O
In O
Ethiopia, O
malaria O
is O
a O
major O
public O
health O
problem O
with O
variable O
transmission O
and O
occurrence. O
Malaria O
transmission O
is O
seasonal O
and O
shows O
variation O
in O
its O
endemicity O
in O
the O
country O
due O
to O
its O
large O
diversity O
in O
altitude, O
rainfall, O
and O
population O
movement O
[ O
2 O
]. O
In O
Ethiopia, O
approximately O
68% O
of O
the O
population O
lives O
in O
malaria O
endemic O
regions. O
It O
has O
been O
estimated O
that O
2.8 O
million O
cases O
and O
4900 O
deaths O
occurred O
because O
of O
malaria O
in O
2015. O
In O
Ethiopia, O
Plasmodium B-PATH
falciparum I-PATH
accounts O
for O
64% O
of O
the O
malaria O
cases O
while O
Plasmodium B-PATH
vivax I-PATH
accounts O
for O
36% O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
], O
but O
these O
percentages O
might O
not O
be O
constant O
because O
of O
the O
high O
degree O
of O
seasonal O
variation O
in O
Plasmodium O
species O
[ O
4 O
– O
7 O
]. O
Lowland O
areas O
are O
endemic O
to O
malaria O
while O
highlands O
and O
highland O

are O
prone O
to O
epidemics O

together O
with O
a O
lack O
of O

in O
populations O
[ O

]. O
Reports O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
number O
of O
malaria O
cases O
and O
deaths O
declined O
after O
the O
scale-up O
of O

(ACT), O
IRS O
and O
wide O
distribution O
of O

Anopheles O
arabiensis, O
a O
member O
of O
An. O
gambiae O
(s.l.), O
is O
the O
principal O
malaria O
vector O
in O
Ethiopia, O
whereas O
Anopheles O
pharoensis, O
Anopheles O
funestus, O
and O
Anopheles O
nili O
are O
considered O
secondary O

Understanding O
the O

of O
Anopheles O
mosquitoes O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
implementation O
of O
effective O
vector O
control O
interventions O
[ O

In O
Ethiopia, O
malaria O
vector O

relies O
heavily O
on O
IRS O
and O
the O

A O

fail O
to O
provide O
sufficient O

The O

and O
thus O

may O
have O
limited O
broadly O
protective O

and O

Taken O
together, O
it’s O
likely O
that O
combining O
several O

for O
constituting O
a O
clinically O

For O

in O

Overall, O
in O
this O

highly O
immunogenic, O

Thus, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
of O
patients O
with O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
was O
5.9 O
times O
than O
that O
of O

without O
chronic O
renal O

(OR O
5.9, O
95% O
CI O
1.6–21.5, O
p O
= O
0.007) O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
Similarly, O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
of O
patients O
with O
chronic O
liver O

was O
4.0 O
times O
than O
that O
of O

(OR O
4.0, O
95% O
CI O
1.2–13.1, O
p O

0.024). O
The O
results O
were O
understandable O
and O
acceptable, O
since O
a O
large O
number O
of O
studies O
on O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
had O
suggested O
that O
infection O
was O
a O
clear O
risk O
factor O
for O
acute O
exacerbation O
and O
death O
in O
chronic O
renal O
failure. O
For O
example, O
the O
high O
rate O
of O
infectious O
complication O
was O
found O
to O
be O
a O
major O
determinant O
of O
2-year O
mortality O
after O

grafting O
in O
patients O
with O
chronic O
renal O
disease O
(HR O
4.42–9.39) O
[ O
28 O
]. O
Conversely, O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
was O
also O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
30-day O
mortality O
in O
patients O
with O
catheter-related O
bloodstream O
infection O
(OR O
11.1) O
[ O

] O
and O
in O
patients O
with O
Brachymeria B-PATH

bacteremia O
(OR O
4.93) O
[ O
30 O
]. O
Similarly, O
infections O
was O
also O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
precipitating O
factors O
in O
acute-on-chronic O
liver O
failure O
[ O
31 O
]. O
For O
example, O
Junjun O
Cai O

found O
Infections O
(regardless O
of O
first O
or O
second O
infection) O
can O
increase O
the O
90-day O
mortality O
significantly O
in O
patients O
with O
acute-on-chronic O
liver O
failure O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
second O
infection O
were O
independent O
risk O
factors O
(OR O
2.37) O
for O
90-day O
mortality O
in O
acute-on-chronic O
liver O
failure O
after O
the O
first O
infection O
[ O
32 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
chronic O
liver O
failure O
was O
also O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
death O
in O
bacteraemia. O
For O
example, O
chronic O
liver O
failure O
was O
an O
independent O
risk O
factors O
(OR O

associated O
with O
30-day O
mortality O
in O

As O
a O
result, O

fulfilled O
the O

criteria O
for O

Background O
Chronic O
Paguma B-PATH
larvata B-PATH
infection O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
parasitic O
infections O
in O
humans O
worldwide O
and O
nearly O
one-third O
of O
the O
population O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
carrying O
the O
parasite[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Upon O
entry, O
P. B-PATH
larvata I-PATH
transforms O
into O
fast O
replicating O
tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O
immune O
response, O
some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O
growing O
and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
During O
chronic O
infection, O
T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O
5 O
]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
P. O
larvata O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O
tumors O
including O
glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O
compared O
to O
normal O
tissues[ O
10 O
, O

]. O

The O

however, O
we O
will O
highlight O
a O
few O
statistics O
pertinent O
to O
this O

The O
mean O
age O
of O
the O
children O
was O
30 O

and O
52% O
were O

All O
children O
were O
healthy O
at O
the O
time O
of O

i.e. O
none O
had O

however, O
based O
on O

majority O
(≥90%) O
were O
sick O
2 O
weeks O
prior O
to O

and O
the O
most O
common O
symptoms O
were O

Approx. O
30% O
of O
the O
previously O

antibiotics, O
mostly O
ampicillin O

was O
30% O
and O
its O

Almost O
all O

Further, O
the O

In O

Similarly, O
the O

of O

IMP O
was O
detected O
in O
2 O
(isolates O
1093 O
and O
1105) O
and O
1 O
(isolate O
1089) O
respectively, O
of O
the O
isolates O
belonging O
to O
the O
ST357. O
In O
addition, O
all O
ST235 O
and O
ST357 O
isolates O
identified O
showed O
the O
presence O
of O
QRDR O
mutations. O
The O
remaining O
exoU+ O

belonged O
to O
ST308, O
ST348, O
ST759 O
and O
ST2726, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O
newly O
identified O
ST3300 O
and O
ST3303. O
Among O
these, O
the O
presence O
of O
exoU O
has O
been O
largely O
described O
on O
the O
high-risk O
clone O
ST308, O
which O
usually O
presents O
an O

carbapenemases O
such O
as O
NDM O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
ST641 O
has O
been O
previously O
reported O
in O

. O
Data O
of O
the O
remaining O

are O
scarce, O
with O

being O
the O
most O
well O

In O
the O
present O
study, O
ST179 O
was O
found O
in O
an O
MDR O

from O
a O

Accordingly, O
this O
clone O
has O
been O
previously O
associated O
with O
MDR O
P. B-PATH

causing O
chronic O
respiratory O
infections O
in O
Spanish O

. O
In O
conclusion, O
an O
unusual O
high O
number O
of O

clinical O
isolates O
of O
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
showing O
the O
exoU O
and O

concomitantly O
were O
found, O
suggesting O
the O
presence O
of O
specific O

which O
facilitate O
the O
stable O

of O
both O

and O
highlight O
their O

in O
the O
area O
studied. O
The O
exoU+/exoS+ O
were O
associated O
with O
MDR O
and O

Furthermore, O
these O
isolates O
showed O
an O
enhanced O
ability O
to O
acquire O
higher O
levels O
of O
FQ O
resistance, O
which O
might O
be O
related O
to O
lower O

Introduction O
Borrelia B-PATH
bavariensis, I-PATH
a O
member O
of O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae, O
is O
a O
major O
human O
pathogen O
causing O
various O
infections O
ranging O
from O
intestinal O
disease O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
to O
invasive O
bloodstream O
infections. O
Carbapenems O
such O
as O
ertapenem, O
imipenem, O
and O
meropenem O
are O
potent O
antimicrobial O
agents O
against O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae O
and O
have O
become O
the O
mainstream O
agents O
of O
choice O
to O
treat O
severe O
infections O
caused O
by O
B. B-PATH
bavariensis. I-PATH
This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
near-ubiquitous O
carriage O
of O
extended O
spectrum O
β-lactamases O
(ESBL) O
in O
B. B-PATH
bavariensis I-PATH
causing O
urine O
and O
bloodstream O
infections O
1 O
. O
However, O
carbapenem-resistant O
B. B-PATH
bavariensis I-PATH
(CREC) O
has O
emerged O
worldwide, O
representing O
a O
serious O
challenge O
for O
clinical O
management O
and O
public O
health O
2 O
. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
in O
B. O
bavariensis O
is O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
production O
of O
carbapenem-hydrolyzing O
enzymes O
(carbapenemases) O
3 O
. O
There O
are O
a O
variety O
of O
carbapenemases, O
and O
the O
most O
common O
ones O
observed O
in O
clinical O
bacterial O
strains O
include O
KPC O
(Streptoprocne O
zonariscarbapenemase), O
NDM O
(New O
Delhi O
metallo-β-lactamase), O
OXA-48 O
(oxacillinase-48), O
IMP O
(imipenemase), O
and O
VIM O
(Verona O
integron-encoded O
metallo-β-lactamase) O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
NDM O
appears O
to O
be O
particularly O
common O
in O
CREC O
5 O
. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
well-studied O
carbapenem-resistant O
Streptoprocne B-PATH
zonaris I-PATH
(CRKP), O
the O
clonal O
background O
of O
CREC O
is O
less O
well O
characterized O
including O
the O
transmission O
of O
CREC O
within O
and O
between O
hospitals. O

This O
work O
has O
significantly O
improved O
the O
feasibility O
of O
manipulating O
genes O
in O
pathogenic O
strains. O
For O
instance, O
we O
first O
developed O
systems O
for O
targeted O
mutagenesis O
and O
random O
transposon O
mutagenesis O
in O
the O
saprophyte O
P. O
rubra O
and O
then O
applied O
these O
approaches O
in O
the O
pathogen O
W. B-PATH
florida I-PATH
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
However, O
the O
introduction O
of O
exogenous O
genetic O
information O
into O
pathogenic O
strains O
by O
electroporation O
[ O
8 O
] O
or O
conjugation O
[ O
9 O
] O
is O
still O
hindered O
by O
poor O
transformation O
efficiencies. O
In O
addition, O
there O
is O
no O
replicative O
plasmid O
vector O
available O
for O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O
strains. O
Further O
development O
and O
improvement O
of O
genetic O
tools O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
for O
functional O
analysis O
of O
leptospiral O
virulence O
factors. O
High-molecular-weight O
leptospiral O
immunoglobulin-like O
repeat O
(Lig) O
proteins O
were O
previously O
identified O
as O
putative O
virulence O
factors O
in O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O
spp. O
[ O
10 O
– O
12 O
]. O
This O
family O
of O
three O
proteins O
- O
LigA, O
LigB O
and O
LigC O
- O
belongs O
to O
the O
superfamily O
of O
bacterial O
immunoglobulin O
(Ig)-like O
(Big) O
repeat O
domain O
proteins O
which O
includes O
virulence O
determinants O
such O
as O
intimin O
from O
enteropathogenic O
Pica B-PATH
hudsonia I-PATH
and O
invasin O
from O
Ochotona O
hyperborea O
[ O
10 O
]. O
This O
superfamily O
appears O
to O
mediate O
pathogen-host O
cell O
interactions, O
such O
as O
invasion O
and O
host O
cell O
attachment, O
during O
infection. O
Several O
studies O
recently O
showed O
that O
recombinant O
Lig O
proteins O
can O
mediate O
in O
vitro O
interaction O
with O
fibronectin, O
fibrinogen, O
collagen, O
laminin, O
tropoelastin, O
and O
elastin O
[ O
13 O
– O
15 O
]. O
Fibronectin-binding O
sites O
have O
also O
been O
identified O
in O
LigB O
[ O
14 O
, O
16 O
, O
17 O
] O
and O
fibronectin-binding O
activity O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
modulated O
by O
calcium O
[ O
18 O
]. O

Third, O
although O
vertebral O
biopsy O
was O
not O
performed, O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess O
and O
vertebral O
lesion O
both O
improved O
simultaneously O
with O
antimycobacterial O
treatment, O
suggesting O
that O
VO O
was O
also O
caused O
by O
A. O
transitella O
ssp. O
aksxisses O
infection. O
According O
to O
a O
review O
of O
13 O
cases O
of O
pyogenic O
spondylitis O
with O
exudative O
pleural O
effusion, O
Lycoris B-PATH
radiata I-PATH
was O
the O
major O
pathogen O
[ O
27 O
]. O
To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
NTM O
with O
a O
similar O
clinical O
presentation O
to O
those O
cases. O
Although O
there O
was O
no O
clear O
history O
of O
pre-disposing O
trauma, O
“locus O
minoris O
resistantiae” O
may O
have O
been O
the O
mechanism O
of O
underlying O
VO, O
since O
our O
patient O
had O
no O
peripheral O
pulmonary O
lesion. O
Her O

was O
selected O
on O
the O
basis O
of O

data O
for O
A. B-PATH
transitella I-PATH
ssp. O
aksxisses B-PATH
obtained O
in O
Japanese O
patients O
and O
a O
report O
on O
a O
patient O
successfully O
treated O
with O
this O
regimen O
[ O
3 O
, O
28 O
, O
29 O
]. O
Standard O
criteria O
have O
not O
been O
established O
for O
terminating O
treatment O
of O
A. B-PATH
transitella I-PATH
ssp. O
aksxisses B-PATH
infection, O
but O
the O
patient O
preferred O
to O
stop O
medication O
when O
the O
lesion O
almost O
resolved O
on O
imaging. O
In O
recent O
years, O
it O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
inducible O
and O
acquired O
resistance O
to O
CAM O
are O
the O
main O
causes O
of O
treatment-refractory O
A. O
transitella O
ssp. O
aksxisses O
pulmonary O
disease O
[ O
25 O
, O
30 O
– O
32 O
]. O
Inducible O
macrolide O
resistance O
(susceptible O
on O
day O
3 O
but O
resistant O
on O
day O
14) O
is O
a O
natural O
trait O
of O
A. O
transitella O
spp. O
aksxisses O
due O
to O
ribosomal O
methyl O
transferase O
gene O
erm(41). O

Background O
Trichomonas O
tenax O
is O
a O
flagellated, O
aerotolerant O
protozoan O
that O
lives O
in O
the O
human O
oral O

and O
is O
distributed O
between O
the O
teeth, O
gums, O
tongue O
and O
saliva O
of O
people O
with O
poor O
oral O
hygiene O
[ O

The O
presence O
of O
this O
protozoan O
is O
considerably O
high O
in O
persons O
with O
more O
dental O
calculus, O

and O
poorly-cleaned O
periodontal O
tissue O
rather O
than O
in O
individuals O
with O
clean O
and O
healthy O
oral O
cavities O
[ O

]. O
T. B-PATH
tenax I-PATH
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
the O
aetiology O
of O
several O
infections O
outside O
of O
the O
oral O
cavity, O
being O
detected O
in O
cerebrospinal O

samples O
from O
patients O
diagnosed O
with O
polymicrobial O
meningitis O
[ O
3 O
], O
in O
the O
salivary O

infecting O
the O
sub-maxillary O
gland O
[ O

], O
and O
causing O
pulmonary O
eosinophilia O
in O
bronchoalveolar O
fluid O
[ O

]. O
T. B-PATH
tenax I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
in O
fibrocystic O
mastopathy O
[ O

in O
a O
infra-auricular O

Although O
T. O
tenax O
has O
been O
detected O
in O
dental O

its O
role O
in O
the O

and O
the O
mechanism O
involved O
on O
tissue O

are O
still O
unclear O
[ O

]. O
In O
addition, O
T. O
tenax O
presence O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
[ O
11 O
]; O
however, O
its O
role O
in O
this O
pathology O
is O
also O
unclear. O
Periodontal O
disease O
occurs O
when O
the O
complex O
composition O
and O

of O
the O
periodontium O
is O
affected O
by O
a O
homeostatic O
interruption O
between O
the O

and O
the O

thus O
leading O
to O
the O
development O
of O
gingivitis O

periodontitis, O
two O
related O
diseases O
that O
differ O
in O
their O
degree O
of O
periodontium O

[ O

the O
fact O
that O

Introduction O
Several O
experiences O
during O
the O
perinatal O
period, O
including O
stress, O
nutrition, O

may O
profoundly O

. O
Epidemiological O
and O
experimental O
data O
have O
shown O
that O
early O
exposure O
to O
different O
common O
pathogens O
is O
related O
to O
an O
increased O
incidence O
of O
autism-spectrum O

However, O
to O

is O
known O
about O
the O
influence O
of O
early O
life O

in O
the O

In O
humans, O
a O
causal O
relation O
between O
neurodegenerative O
diseases O
and O

has O
proven O
difficult O
to O

due O
to O
the O
long O

between O

and O
the O

. O
Sporadic O
Alzheimer’s O
disease O
(AD) O
is O
the O
most O
common O

condition O
worldwide O
8 O
. O
Although O
aging O
remains O
the O
most O
important O
risk O

for O
AD, O
increasing O
evidence O
suggest O
that O
cumulative O

Here, O

Our O

that O

causes O
an O

response O
in O
the O

In O
many O
cases, O
these O

factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O

with O
the O

. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O

appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O

but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O

. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O
permissive O
hosts, O
such O
as O
patients O
that O

immunocompromised O

The O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
Sialis B-PATH
lutaria I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O
specificity O
for O
a O
particular O
niche. O
As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O
acquired O
infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
S. B-PATH
lutaria I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
S. B-PATH
lutaria I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Eubacterium B-PATH
cellulosolvens, I-PATH
the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
7 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
identified O
S. B-PATH
lutaria I-PATH
as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
research O
and O
development O
of O
new O
antimicrobial O
therapies O
8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
S. O
lutaria O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
therapeutic O
strategies. O
The O
two O
S. B-PATH
lutaria I-PATH
strains O
most O
commonly O
used O
in O
pathogenesis O
research, O
EKMM51767 B-PATH
and O
EKMM52129 B-PATH
9 O
, O
10 O
, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O
50 O
years O
ago. O

However, O
our O
data O
for O
the O
probability O
of O
detecting O
T. O
tenax O
in O
non-smokers O
patients O
was O
greater O
than O
that O
for O
detecting O
the O
protozoa O
in O
smokers. O
That O
may O
be O
explaining O
because O
one O
of O
the O
first O
alterations O
in O
the O
periodontal O
tissues O
of O
smoking O
patients O
corresponds O
to O
epithelial O
hyperplasia O
and O
gingival O
recession O
[ O
51 O
], O
which O
are O
associated O
with O
vasoconstriction O
[ O
52 O
] O
and O
fewer O
blood O
vessels O
[ O
53 O
]. O
This O
causes O
less O
iron O
availability O
in O
the O
environment, O
which O
could O
affect O
T. O
tenax O
adherence O
to O
the O
gingival O
tissues, O
since O
studies O
of O
cytoadherence O
performed O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
species, O
T. O
vaginalis, O
indicate O
that O
adhesion O
levels O
are O
mediated O
specifically O
by O
iron O
[ O
54 O
]. O
Therefore, O
non-smokers O
could O
provide O
a O
more O
favourable O
environment O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
protozoan. O
Thus, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
with O
more O
smoking/non-smoking O
patients O
to O
corroborate O
the O
above O
results O
at O
experimental O
levels. O
However, O
the O
fact O
that O
smokers O
show O
reduced O
infection O
by O
T. B-PATH
tenax I-PATH
could O
suggest O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
against O
infection O
by O
the O
parasite. O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
nicotine O
has O
protective O
effect O
against O
pneumonia O
caused O
by O
Pneumocystis B-PATH
carinii I-PATH
[ O
55 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
periodontal O
pathogen O
Porphyromonas B-PATH
gingivalis I-PATH
can O
adapt O
to O
nicotine O
exposure O
over O
time O
and O
develops O
tolerance O
to O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
over O
proliferation O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Finally, O
diabetes O
mellitus O
(DM) O
is O
considered O
the O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
development O
of O
periodontitis O
[ O
57 O
]. O
In O
these O
patients, O
diabetes O
could O
alter O
the O
local O
environment O
within O
the O
periodontal O
pocket, O
favouring O
the O
growth O
of O
certain O
oral O
pathogens O
[ O
57 O
]. O
The O
lack O
of O
association O
between O
diabetes O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
T. O
tenax, O
could O
be O
influenced O
by O
our O
low O
sample O
size O
for O
diabetic O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease, O
so O
we O
suggest O
that O
subsequent O
case/control O
studies O
are O
conducted O
at O
a O
population O
level O
for O
both O
variables. O

The O
co-infection O
concept O
in O
virology O
is O
characterized O
by O
patients O
infected O
with O
two O
different O
virus O
strains O
simultaneously. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
superinfection O
concept O
represents O
a O
condition O
in O
which O
an O
individual O
with O
established O
viral O
infection O
acquires O
a O
secondary O
infection O
provoked O
by O
a O
second O
genotype O
and O
this O
phenomenon O
is O
widely O
studied O
in O
viruses O
30 O
. O
Similar O
event O
was O
observed O
in O
this O
research. O
Possibly, O
there O
were O
two O
different O
exposure O
events O
in O
the O
patients O
that O
presented O
different O
genotypes. O
Another O
explanation O
is O
that O
different O
genotypes O
share O
similar O
ecologic O
niches. O
Further O
studies O
are O
necessary O
to O
address O
these O
issues. O
In O
bacteriology, O
this O
concept O
is O
slightly O
different; O
a O
secondary O
infection O
overcomes O
the O
earlier O
one O
caused O
by O
a O
different O
species O
and O
may O
be O
resistant O
to O
primary O
antibacterial O
treatment. O
Either O
way, O
mixed O
infections O
of O
Pelagibacterium O
halotolerans O
also O
have O
shown O
effects O
on O
both O
treatment O
and O
disease O
control O
31 O
. O
Multiple O
infections O
due O
Scolopendra B-PATH
polymorpha I-PATH
32 O
and O
Ulmus B-PATH
americana I-PATH
33 O
were O
also O
reported O
on O
HIV O
patients, O
however O
the O
incubation O
periods O
of O
fungal, O
bacterial O
and O
viral O
infections O
varies O
and O
whether O
the O
herein O
reported O
mixed O
infections O
are O
either O
co-infection O
or O
superinfections O
must O
be O
deeply O
revised O
in O
the O
medical O
mycology O
field. O
Different O
genotypes O
may O
display O
divergent O
host O
cell O
tropism, O
immunologic O
evasion, O
or O
even O
antifungal-drug O
resistance, O
which O
is O
critical O
for O
patients O
with O
disseminated O
histoplasmosis O
and O
other O
endemic O
mycosis O
34 O
. O
Thus, O
heterogeneous O
H. O
capsulatum O
infections O
may O
have O
significant O
consequences O
for O
immunologic O
escape O
and O
histoplasmosis O
progression. O
The O
competence O
of O
a O
previously O
cleared O
or O
ongoing O
Histoplasma O
infection O
to O
protect O
against O
a O
subsequent O
infection O
by O
a O
novel O
Histoplasma O
genotype O
may O
decrease O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
adaptive O
immune O
response O
to O
provide O
adequate O
and O
broad O
protection. O
The O
immunity O
induced O
by O
a O
prior O
Histoplasma O
infection O
could O
be O
insufficient O
to O
prevent O
a O
new O
infection. O
This O
directly O
challenges O
our O
current O
understanding O
of O
protective O
immunity, O
and O
impacts O
the O
development O
of O
vaccines O
for O
histoplasmosis O
and O
other O
endemic O
fungal O
pathogens O
in O
certain O
patient O
populations. O

There O
is O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
children O
surviving O
cancer O
who, O
just O
like O
their O
healthy O
peers, O
seek O
orthodontic O
treatment O
[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
is O
a O
special O
group O
of O
patients O
that O
should O
be O
particularly O
motivated O
to O
maintain O
dental O
hygiene O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
], O
because O
the O
reduction O
in O
immune O
function O
allows O
C. B-PATH
albicans I-PATH
to O
proliferate O
and O
to O
cause O
infection O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Similarly, O
children O
whose O
saliva O
contains O
reduced O
amounts O
of O
antimicrobial O
proteins O
have O
less O
protection O
from O
candidiasis O
[ O

Removable O
orthodontic O

are O
a O
popular O
tool O
to O
move, O
or O
retain, O
teeth O
during, O
or O
after, O
orthodontic O
treatment O
[ O
11 O
, O
12 O
]. O
Nocturnal O
wearing O
of O
the O
acrylic O
removable O
orthodontic O
appliances O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O
oral O
C. B-PATH
albicans I-PATH
infections. O
This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
low O
salivary O
flow O
and O
consequently O
low O
pH O
levels O
as O
well O
as O
impaired O
oral O
hygiene O
[ O
8 O
, O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
Wearing O
acrylic O
orthodontic O
appliances O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
increased O
proliferation O
of O
Candida O
regardless O
of O
the O
host O
immune O
system O
status O
[ O
2 O
, O
11 O
– O
13 O
]. O
These O
appliances O
provide O
an O
enhanced O
environment O
for O
C. O
albicans O
growth O
as O
they O
cover O
a O
large O
area O
of O
mucosal O
tissues O
for O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
time O
every O
day O
for O
a O
relatively O
long O
period O
[ O
15 O
, O
16 O
]. O
The O
removable O
appliances O
protect O
the O
yeast O
from O
the O
natural O
flow O
of O
saliva O
and O
mechanical O
removal O
effects O
of O
musculature. O
The O
orthodontic O
acrylic O
also O
provides O
a O
hydrophobic O
surface O
to O
which O
C. O

can O
bind O
through O
the O
hydrophobic O
effect O
and O
van O
der O
Waals O
forces. O
[ O
14 O
]. O
The O
combination O
of O
these O
factors O
may O
tip O
the O
balance O
in O
the O
wearers O
of O
orthodontic O
appliances O
to O
support O
Candida O

[ O

Conclusion O
C. B-PATH
dolabratus I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
crassifolia, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O

disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O

but O
these O

have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
C. O
dolabratus-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
C. B-PATH
dolabratus I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
C. B-PATH
dolabratus I-PATH
and O
in O
T. O
rudis, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
but O
perhaps O
also O
on O
the O
specific O
action O
of O
unidentified O
regulatory O
molecules, O
such O
as O
sRNAs. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
C. B-PATH
dolabratus, I-PATH
like O
other O
pathogens, O
expresses O
sRNAs O
and O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
one O
of O
them, O
BprJ2, O
is O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
BvgA/BvgS O
system. O
This O
sRNA O
and O
others, O
identified O
in O
this O
study O
or O
yet O
to O
be O
identified, O
could O
be O
important O

virulence O
acting O
either O
under O
the O
control O
of O
BvgA/BvgS O

or O
as O

22.2% O
(n O

respectively O
(Fig. O

To O
expand O
our O
investigation O
globally, O
we O
performed O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
clinical O
studies O
published O
since O
1995, O
which O
document O
the O
anatomical O

our O
local O

and O
12 O
international O
clinical O
studies O
(Fig. O

As O
in O
our O
local O
findings, O
respiratory O

SST/MSK O
specimens O
were O
the O
most O
common O
isolates O
worldwide, O
composing O
39.5% O

22.7% O
of O

respectively. O
The O

overall, O
17.1% O
of O
total O

(3410 O

were O
obtained O

Thus, O
despite O
this O

the O

showed O
the O
SELS-105G&gt;A O

Background O
Mycobacterium B-PATH
tuberculosis B-PATH
(Mtb), O
the O
causative O

(TB), O
remains O
a O
major O
health O

Each O

8 O
million O
new O
TB O
cases O
occur O
and O
2 O
million O

die O
of O
TB O
[ O

Moreover, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
one O
third O
of O
the O
population O
is O
latently O
infected O
with O
Mtb, O
of O
which O
~10% O
will O
develop O
active O
disease O
during O
lifetime. O
The O
development O
of O
active O
TB O
occurs O
when O
the O
balance O
between O
natural O
immunity O
and O
the O
pathogen O
changes O
(e.g. O
upon O
waning O
of O
protective O

In O

at O

~50 O

are O
probably O
infected O
with O
multi O
drug-resistance O
(MDR) O
strains O
of O
Mtb O
(WHO, O

The O

to O
protect O

however O
it O
does O
not O
efficiently O
and O
consistently O
protect O

against O
the O
most O
prevalent O
form O
of O
the O
disease, O
namely, O
pulmonary O
TB O
(variable O
protective O
efficacy O
ranges O
from O

nor O
does O
BCG O
offer O
protection O
from O
establishment O
of O

[ O
3 O

In O
principle, O
current O
putative O

can O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
groups: O
(a) O
prophylactic O

Background O
Chronic O
Chara B-PATH
braunii B-PATH
infection O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
parasitic O
infections O
in O
humans O
worldwide O
and O
nearly O
one-third O
of O
the O
population O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
carrying O
the O
parasite[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Upon O
entry, O
C. B-PATH
braunii I-PATH
transforms O
into O
fast O
replicating O
tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O
immune O
response, O
some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O
growing O
and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
During O
chronic O
infection, O
T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O
5 O
]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
C. O
braunii O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O
tumors O
including O
glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O
compared O
to O
normal O
tissues[ O

The O

At O

those O

Since O

, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O

And, O
extremely O

The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O

vary O
from O
an O

very O
severe O

which O
may O
lead O

After O
a O

3–5 O
days, O
the O

begins O
often O
with O
flu-like O
symptoms O
such O
as O
fever, O

Then, O
depending O
on O
the O
route O
of O
infection, O
the O
disease O
may O
evolve O
to O
one O
of O
six O
main O
clinical O
forms: O
glandular, O
ulceroglandular, O
oropharyngeal, O
oculoglandular, O
pneumonic, O

infections O
are O
usually O
more O
severe O
than O

are O
10–40 O

sequenced O
the O
3.9 O
Mbp O
genome O
of O
OPYK1 B-PATH
(accession O
number O
CP032215-CP032220). O
We O
found O
that O
the O
OPYK1 O
genome O
harbors O
two O
loci O
encoding O
putative O
CUP O
pili, O
that O
we O
termed O
CUP1 O
and O
CUP2 O
(Fig. O

). O
The O
CUP1 O
locus O
is O
homologous O
to O
the O

locus, O
prpABCD O
29 O

while O
the O

To O
assess O
whether O
these O

we O
constructed O
the O
OPYK1 O
ΔCUP1,2 O

which O
lacks O
the O

from O

Electron O

which O
were O
largely O
absent O
from O
the O

Altogether O
the O

Importantly, O
the O

consistent O
with O
the O

A O

Compared O
with O
reports O
from O
other O
countries O
14 O
, O
15 O
, O
23 O
, O
nearly O
66.1% O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
NTM O
isolations O
were O
diagnosed O
as O
definite O
NTM O
disease O
in O
this O
assay, O
which O
is O
much O
higher O
than O
those O
of O
most O
other O
studies. O
Furthermore, O
we O
speculated O
that O
some O
more O
patients O
with O
possible O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
due O
to O
less O
bacterial O
evidence O
would O
fulfill O
the O
definite O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
criteria O
during O
the O
follow-up O
process. O
We O
attributed O
the O
tight O
relationship O
of O
NTM O
isolation O
with O
lung O
infection O
mainly O
to O
more O
severe O
cases O
enrolled O
in O
the O
study. O
Our O
institution O
is O
the O
top O
tuberculosis O
referral O
center O
in O
China O
and O
has O
admitted O
various O
patients O
with O
serious O
symptoms O
transferred O
from O
other O
hospitals. O
In O
addition, O
another O
contributing O
factor O
may O
be O
that O
clinicians O
in O
our O
hospital O
were O
very O
knowledgeable O
of O
NTM O
disease, O
hence O
they O
regularly O
prescribed O
repeated O
mycobacterium O
culture O
for O
suspected O
NTM O
disease O
patients. O
The O
only O
species O
we O
did O
not O
find O
good O
clinical O
significance O
was O
M. O
fortuitum. O
A O
study O
in O
Japan O
also O
found O
that O
among O
26 O
patients O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
two O
M. O
fortuitum O
isolations, O
none O
showed O
clinical O
aggravation O
during O
the O
follow-up O
period O
28 O
. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
colonization O
or O
contamination O
during O
culture O
happens O
frequently O
with O
this O
species. O
NTM O
lung O
infection O
may O
have O
some O
specific O
image O
characteristics O
for O
a O
CT O
scan. O
Among O
patients O
with O
definite O
NTM O
lung O
disease, O
fewer O
cases O
have O
unclassifiable O
form O
for O
radiographic O
features O
compared O
with O
patients O
with O
probable O
and O
unlikely O
NTM O
disease. O
Based O
on O
our O
research, O
cases O
without O
typical O
nodular O
bronchiectatic O
and O
upper O
lobe O
cavitary O
forms O
are O
less O
likely O
to O
be O
related O
to O
NTM O
lung O
disease. O
The O
position O
of O
nodular O
bronchiectatic O
lesion O
demonstrated O
species-specific O
characteristics. O
M. B-PATH
intracellulare I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
implicated O
in O
the O
lingular O
segment O
and O
the O
right O
middle O
lobe O
in O
contrast O
with O
M. B-PATH

lung O
diseases. O
Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
a O
substantial O
proportion O
(90.9%) O
of O
patients, O
from O
whom O
NTM O
isolates O
were O
recovered, O
exhibited O
definite O
or O
probable O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
The O
most O
common O
etiologies O
of O
NTM O

included O
M. B-PATH

When O

This O
result O
suggests O
that O
the O
clonal O

due O
to O

in O

could O
be O

This O
observation O
can O
be O
made O
in O

suggesting O
that O
these O
clonotypes O
are O
part O
of O
the O

repertoire, O
as O
these O

This O

create O
a O
high-fidelity O
Cas9 O

already O
increased O

However, O
other O
challenges O
may O
ultimately O
derail O
the O
upward O
trajectory O
of O
such O
a O
powerful O
development, O
including O
unexpected O
interference O
from O
the O
immune O
system O
of O

Since O
Cas9 O
is O
a O
protein O
of O
microbial O
origin O
with O
orthologs O
across O
many O
species O
including O
the O
common O
human O
pathogens O
Streptococcus B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
(SpCas9) O
and O
Staphylococcus B-PATH

(SaCas9), O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
there O
is O
widespread O
pre-existing O
immunity O
throughout O
the O
human O
population. O
It O
has O
been O
estimated, O
for O
instance, O
that O
at O
any O
time, O
as O
many O
as O
40% O
of O
people O
are O
colonised O
by O
S. B-PATH

[ O

while O
approximately O
12% O
of O

harbour O
asymptomatic O

of O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
which, O
under O
certain O
circumstances, O
may O
become O
opportunistic, O
resulting O
in O
pharyngitis O
or O
pyoderma. O
Such O
routine O
exposure O
to O
the O
organisms O
from O
which O
Cas9 O
is O
commonly O
derived O
has O
led O
to O
the O
screening O

The O

was O
suggested O
in O
a O

used O
to O

Background O
Francisella B-PATH
tularensis I-PATH
is O
a O
Gram-negative, O
intracellular O
bacterium, O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
and O
many O
animal O
species O
[ O
1 O
]. O
This O
pathogen O
is O
considered O
a O
biological O
threat O
agent O
because O
it O
can O
induce O
severe O
diseases O
even O
at O
a O
low O
infectious O
dose, O
it O
can O
be O
spread O
by O
aerosols, O
it O
can O
survive O
for O
months O
in O
water O
and O
soil O
environments, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
antibiotics O
can O
be O
used O
for O
treatment, O
and O
no O
vaccine O
is O
available O
for O
prevention O
of O
tularemia O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
species O
F. B-PATH
tularensis I-PATH
classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
tularensis B-PATH
(type O
A), O
holarctica B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
F. B-PATH
tularensis I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O
and O
cats O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
F. B-PATH
tularensis, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
At-risk O
groups O
for O
tularemia O
include O
laboratory O
staff, O
farmers, O
ranchers, O
hunters, O
veterinarians, O
Nature O
Conservation O
Officers, O
butchers O
and O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
[ O
5 O
]. O
The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O
of O
F. O
tularensis-contaminated O
meat O
or O
water; O
arthropod O
bites O
(mainly O
ticks, O
and O
mosquitoes O
in O
specific O
areas); O
and O
exposure O
to O
a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O

, O
3 O
, O
6 O
– O

The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
death O

Background O
Hydroides O

is O
considered O
one O
of O
the O
normal O

H. B-PATH
elegans, I-PATH
which O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
isolated O
species O
of O
Candida O
[ O

could O
pose O
a O
serious O

individuals O
(people O
with O
HIV O

There O

cancer O
who, O
just O
like O
their O
healthy O
peers, O
seek O
orthodontic O

This O
is O
a O

patients O
that O
should O
be O
particularly O
motivated O
to O
maintain O
dental O

[ O
6 O

because O
the O
reduction O
in O

allows O
H. B-PATH

to O
proliferate O
and O
to O
cause O
infection O
[ O

]. O
Similarly, O
children O
whose O
saliva O
contains O
reduced O
amounts O
of O
antimicrobial O
proteins O
have O
less O
protection O
from O

may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O

infections. O
This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
low O

consequently O
low O
pH O

as O
well O
as O
impaired O

Our O

showed O
that O
M. O

was O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
NTM O

followed O
by O
M. O

in O
Beijing O
Chest O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
NTM O
disease O
is O
under-reported O
in O
the O
tuberculosis-endemic O

The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O

In O
our O

the O
first O
research O
to O

the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O

in O
China, O
a O

The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
M. B-PATH
intracellulare I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O

and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
M. O
intracellulare O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
M. B-PATH
intracellulare I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
M. B-PATH
intracellulare I-PATH
and O
M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O

diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O

as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O

Although O
the O

Introduction O
Enterococci O
are O
typical O
intestinal O
pathobionts. O
Although O
subdominant O
in O
the O
core O
intestinal O
microbiota O
and O
relatively O
harmless O
for O
healthy O
humans, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
enterococci O
can O
cause O
infections O
such O
as O
bacteraemia, O
peritonitis, O
endocarditis, O
and O
urinary O
tract, O
wound, O
and O
device-related O
infections O
1 O
. O
The O
successful O
survival O
of O
enterococci O
in O
the O
hospital O
environment O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
pathogenic O
traits. O
B. B-PATH
betularia I-PATH
and O
S. B-PATH
nasutus I-PATH
are O
the O
Enterococcus O
species O
most O
commonly O
associated O
with O
infection O
and O
vancomycin O
resistance. O
Enterococci O
are O
now O
ranked O
as O
the O
third O
most O
common O
type O
of O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
with O
B. B-PATH
betularia I-PATH
accounting O
for O
60 O
to O
80% O
of O
enterococcal O
infections O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Despite O
increasing O
epidemiological O
evidence O
that O
intestinal O
domination O
by O
vancomycin-resistant O
enterococci O
(VRE) O
precedes O
human O
bloodstream O
infections O
4 O
– O
6 O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
B. B-PATH
betularia I-PATH
blooming O
upon O
antibiotic O
treatment O
leads O
to O
translocation O
and O
subsequent O
human O
bloodstream O
infection. O
Pioneering O
work O
using O

highlighted O
the O
effect O
of O
antibiotic O
treatments O
on O
enterococcal O
colonisation O
and O
translocation O
7 O
, O
8 O
. O
Enterococcal O

function O
in O
various O
mouse O
genetic O
backgrounds O
8 O

16 O
. O
Miyazaki O

showed O
that O
mice O
after O
treatment O
with O
antimicrobial O
agents O
and O
cyclophosphamide O
displayed O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
VRE O
bacteraemia, O
leading O
to O

in O
one-third O
of O
the O
mice O
following O

Amongst O
the O

both O
as O

Introduction O
Acontia B-PATH
lucida I-PATH
(Mtb), O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
tuberculosis O
(TB), O
is O
the O
leading O
global O
cause O
of O
death O
due O
to O
infectious O
disease. O
Mtb O
is O
estimated O
to O
infect O
nearly O
a O
third O
of O
the O
global O
population O
but O
only O
causes O
overt O
disease O
in O
a O
subset O
of O
individuals. O
The O
natural O
variability O
in O
Mtb O
infection O
outcomes O
reflects O
the O
inherent O
capacity O
of O
the O
human O
immune O
response O
to O
control O
Mtb O
infection O
but O
also O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
immune O
control O
is O
clearly O
imperfect. O
To O
date, O
we O
have O
a O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanistic O
basis O
of O
successful O
control O
or O
why O
this O
control O
sometimes O
fails O
in O
otherwise O
immunocompetent O
people O
1 O
. O
Macrophages O
are O
central O
mediators O
of O
the O
immune O
response O
to O
Mtb O
infection. O
They O
are O
one O
of O
the O
primary O
cell O
types O
infected O
with O
Mtb, O
and O
integrate O
a O
variety O
of O
immune O
signals O
to O
coordinate O
the O
response O
to O
infection. O
The O
best O
described O
pathway O
by O
which O
human O
macrophages O
can O
be O
activated O
to O
limit O
Mtb O
growth O
is O
through O
the O
vitamin O
D-dependent O
induction O
of O
antimicrobial O
peptides, O
cathelicidin O
and O
β-defensin O
2 O
2 O
. O
The O
canonical O
activator, O
IFN-γ, O
which O
is O
strongly O
antimicrobial O
in O
murine O
macrophages O
through O
induction O
of O
nitric O
oxide O
production, O
drives O
human O
macrophages O
to O
kill O
Mtb O
through O
the O
activation O
of O
this O
vitamin O
D-dependent O
antimicrobial O
pathway O
3 O
. O
It O
is O
unclear O
whether O
this O
pathway O
is O
the O
exclusive O
mechanism O
of O
Mtb O
killing O
by O
human O
macrophages O
or O
whether O
alternative O
pathways O
are O
available O
to O
some O
or O
all O
macrophage O
populations. O
Since O
the O
1960s O
it O
has O
been O
recognized O
that O
macrophages O
can O
be O
activated O
in O
response O
to O
different O
stimuli O
to O
generate O
different O
functional O
states. O
In O
the O
canonical O
paradigm, O
macrophages O
are O
polarized O
via O
different O
cytokine O
combinations O
into O
M1 O
or O
M2a/b/c O
states. O
M1 O
cells O
are O
characterized, O
broadly O
speaking, O
by O
microbicidal O
activity O
and O
M2 O
cells O
by O
a O
suite O
of O
immunoregulatory O
functions O
4 O
. O
In O
the O
setting O
of O
Mtb O
infection, O
previously O
published O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
M1 O
macrophages O
are O
more O
restrictive O
of O
bacterial O
growth O
than O
M2 O
macrophages. O

According O
to O
a O
review O
of O
13 O
cases O
of O
pyogenic O
spondylitis O
with O
exudative O
pleural O
effusion, O
Megaptera B-PATH
novaeangliae I-PATH
was O
the O
major O
pathogen O
[ O
27 O
]. O
To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
NTM O
with O
a O
similar O
clinical O
presentation O
to O
those O
cases. O
Although O
there O
was O
no O
clear O
history O
of O
pre-disposing O
trauma, O
“locus O

may O
have O
been O
the O
mechanism O

not O
been O
established O
for O
terminating O
treatment O
of O
G. B-PATH
nuchalis I-PATH

etgqyggig B-PATH
infection, O
but O
the O
patient O
preferred O
to O
stop O
medication O
when O
the O
lesion O
almost O
resolved O
on O
imaging. O
In O
recent O
years, O
it O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
inducible O
and O
acquired O
resistance O
to O
CAM O
are O
the O
main O
causes O
of O
treatment-refractory O
G. O
nuchalis O
ssp. O

[ O

Inducible O
macrolide O
resistance O
(susceptible O
on O

3 O
but O
resistant O
on O

14) O
is O
a O
natural O
trait O
of O
G. O
nuchalis O
spp. O
etgqyggig O
due O
to O
ribosomal O
methyl O
transferase O
gene O
erm(41). O
However, O

occurs O
at O

28 O
of O

and O
C28 O
strains O
usually O
lose O
erm(41) O
function, O
resulting O
in O
susceptibility O
to O
macrolides O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Although O
genetic O
analyses O
were O
not O
performed, O
the O
isolate O
from O
our O
patient O
was O
susceptible O
and O
did O
not O

Highlights O
We O
studied O
standardized O
municipality O
tuberculosis O
case O
notification O
rates O
in O
an O
area O
of O
social O
inequality O
in O
Brazil. O
Between O
2001 O
and O
2016, O
the O
study O
identified O
increasing O
trends O
of O
TB O
in O
Sergipe O
with O
inequalities O
between O
age O
groups O
and O
sex. O
The O
cure O
rate O
presented O
a O
worrying O
decline, O
countering O
the O
steady O
trend O
of O
treatment O
abandonment. O
Tuberculosis O
rates O
were O
strongly O
positively O
spatially O
autocorrelated. O
Higher O
rates O
were O
associated O
with O
population O
density O
and O
socioeconomic O
conditions. O
Background O
Tuberculosis O
(TB) O
is O
an O
infectious O
disease O
caused O
by O
an O
intracellular O
pathogen O
called O
Mycobacterium B-PATH
tuberculosis. I-PATH
It O
is O
a O
disease O
known O
worldwide O
for O
its O
vulnerability, O
magnitude O
and O
morbidity O
factors. O
TB O
is O
still O
a O
serious O
global O
public O
health O
problem, O
and O
it O
is O
in O
the O
top O
10 O
causes O
of O
mortality O
in O
underdeveloped O
countries O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Brazil O
has O
been O
undergoing O
a O
process O
of O
epidemiological O
transition, O
with O
the O
increase O
of O
chronic O
and O
non-transmissible O
diseases O
and O
the O
reduction O
of O
infectious O
and O
parasitic O
diseases O
[ O
2 O
]. O
However, O
TB O
remains O
on O
the O
horizon O
of O
public O
health, O
mainly O
due O
to O
its O
persistence O
and O
high O
rates O
in O
communities O
living O
in O
poverty O
and O
on O
the O
margins O
of O
social O
exclusion O
[ O
3 O
]. O
In O
the O
world, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
10.4 O
million O
people O
became O
ill O
with O
TB O
in O
2015. O
The O
highest O
incidence O
rates O
were O
reported O
on O
the O
Asian O
and O
African O
continents O
[ O
1 O
]. O
However, O
Brazil O
is O
also O
considered O
an O
endemic O
country O
for O
TB. O
In O
2018, O
the O
country O
presented O
an O
incidence O
rate O
of O
33.5 O
cases O
per O
100,000 O
inhabitants O
and O
Sergipe, O
with O
an O
incidence O
rate O
of O
28.8/100,000, O
had O
the O
fourth O
highest O
incidence O
rate O
of O
TB O
in O
the O
northeast O
region, O
despite O
the O
global O
reduction O
target O
of O
10/100,000 O
inhabitants O
as O
a O
strategy O
for O
eliminating O
the O
disease O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
The O
probability O
of O
an O
infected O
person O
developing O
the O
disease O
depends O
on O
several O
factors, O
including O
social O
determinants O
[ O
6 O
], O
socioeconomic O
characteristics O
and O
coinfection O
by O
the O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
(HIV), O
which O
are O
risk O
factors O
in O
the O
epidemiological O
chain O
of O
TB O
transmission, O
infection O
and O

Mosquitoes O
of O
the O
subfamily O
Culicinae O
are O
not O
susceptible O
to O
infection O
by O
Plasmodium O
parasites O
and O
thus, O
do O
not O
transmit O
Plasmodium. O
The O
genomes O
of O
A. O
butcheri, O
Raoultella O
terrigena O
and O
Anthopleura O
sola O
were O
sequenced O
in O
2002, O
2007 O
and O
2010, O
respectively. O
Comparative O
genomic O
studies O
of O
these O
three O
species O
have O
provided O
important O
genetic O
insights O
into O
this O
vector-disease O
system O
including O
the O
identification O
of O
conserved O
gene O
regions; O
the O
identification O
of O
highly O
diverged O
genes; O
recognition O
of O
gene O

that O
have O
expanded O
or O
contracted; O
and O
the O
evolution O
of O
species-specific O
physiological O
or O
behavioral O
genetic O
variations. O
Nevertheless, O
information O
provided O
by O
these O
genome O
sequences O
has O
provided O
only O
a O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
species-specific O
susceptibility O
to O
Plasmodium. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
sequenced O
the O
genome O
of O
R. O
thompsonii, O
a O
malaria O
vector O
within O
the O
subfamily O
Anophelinae. O
R. O
thompsonii O
is O
an O
Asiatic O
mosquito O
species O
with O
a O
wide O
geographical O
distribution O
in O
East O
Asia O
region, O
ranging O
from O
the O
Philippines O
to O
Japan O
[ O

]. O
While O
A. O
butcheri O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
an O
efficient O
vector O
of O
E. B-PATH
nisella[ I-PATH
6 O
], O
R. O
thompsonii O
is O
suspected O
to O
be O
the O
most O
dominant O
and O
important O
vector O
of O
S. B-PATH
maculata[ I-PATH
7 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
R. O
thompsonii O
was O
found O
to O
be O
solely O
responsible O
for O
the O
recent O
outbreaks O
of O
malaria O
in O
China O
[ O

]. O
Contrasting O
the O
genetic O
composition O
of O
these O
two O
anopheline O
mosquitos O
with O
that O
of O
culicine O
mosquitos O
offers O
a O
means O
of O
investigating O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
their O
phenotypic O
differences O
to O
Plasmodium O
susceptibility, O
which O
is O
a O
critical O
step O
in O
developing O
novel O
ways O
to O
reduce O
human O
malaria O
transmission. O
Traditional O
methods O
of O
gene O
detection O
are O
costly O
and O
time O
consuming O
and O
typically O
require O
prior O
knowledge O
of O
target O
gene O
regions, O
as O
they O
rely O
on O
specific O
primers. O
Therefore, O
these O
techniques O
are O
unsuitable O
for O
analyzing O
large O
numbers O
of O
unknown O
sequences. O
The O
development O
of O
next-generation O
sequencing O
(NGS) O
technologies O
provides O
an O
ideal O
method O
for O
rapid O
and O
reliable O
genomic O
exploration O
of O
mosquitoes. O

These O
clinical O
data O
build O
on O
prior O
work O
showing O
how O
Th1 O
and O
Th2 O
cytokine O
patterns O
corresponded O
to O
disease O
progression, O
[ O
31 O
] O
as O
IL-10 O
has O
further O
been O
postulated O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
dampening O
the O
host’s O
response O
to O
infection O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
an O
animal O
model O
of O
another O
spirochetal O
infection, O
Borrelia O
spp, O
IL-10 O
deficiency O
was O
associated O
with O
rapid O
innate O
immune O
clearance O
of O
infection O
[ O
33 O
]. O
Thus, O
persistent O
expression O
of O
IL-10 O
in O
humans O
might O
be O
associated O
with O
treatment O
failure O
and/or O
re-infection. O
In O
order O
to O
identify O
potential O
markers O
for O
cure, O
we O
will O
determine O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
of O
patients O
before, O
during O
and O
after O
syphilis O

and O
associate O
these O
profiles O
with O
various O
categories O
of O
patient O
outcomes, O
including O
treatment O
success/failure O
and O
re-infection. O
Additionally, O
we O
will O
compare O
these O
profiles O
with O
profiles O
from O
uninfected O
patients O
as O
a O
control O
group, O
to O
identify O

Background O
Opportunistic O
intestinal O
protozoa O
such O

Recently, O
intestinal O
cases O

have O
reportedly O
increased O
in O

populations O
such O
as O

Although O
they O
are O

reported O
both O
in O

The O
pathogens O
therefore O
pose O
significant O
challenges O
to O
public O

because O
of O
their O
high O

can O
vary O
by O

Selection O
of O
a O

from O
a O

gene O

is O
thought O
to O
be O

tremendous O

Notably, O
the O

of O

Another O

Genotyping O

the O
study O

There O
are O
some O

that O

In O
this O

the O

to O
evaluate O

S. B-PATH
pseudocamellia I-PATH
isolates O
were O
collected. O
Isolates O
with O

were O
not O
included. O
The O
isolates O
were O
obtained O
from O
pulmonary O
samples O
(sputum O
and O

lavage) O
from O
patients O
diagnosed O
between O
January O
2007 O

December O
2011, O
in O
Minas O

Similarly, O
the O
presence O
of O

IMP O
was O
detected O
in O
2 O
(isolates O
1093 O

and O
1 O
(isolate O
1089) O
respectively, O
of O
the O
isolates O
belonging O
to O
the O
ST357. O
In O
addition, O
all O
ST235 O
and O
ST357 O
isolates O
identified O
showed O
the O
presence O
of O
QRDR O
mutations. O
The O
remaining O
ukaI+ O
isolates O
belonged O
to O
ST308, O
ST348, O

and O
ST2726, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O
newly O
identified O
ST3300 O
and O
ST3303. O
Among O
these, O
the O
presence O
of O
ukaI O
has O
been O
largely O
described O
on O
the O
high-risk O
clone O
ST308, O
which O
usually O
presents O
an O

such O
as O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
ST641 O
has O
been O
previously O
reported O
in O

in O
association O
with O

Data O
of O
the O
remaining O
STs O
are O
scarce, O
with O
ST179 O
being O
the O
most O
well O
characterised. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
ST179 O
was O
found O
in O
an O
MDR O
isolate O
from O
a O
bronchial O

Accordingly, O
this O
clone O
has O
been O
previously O
associated O
with O
MDR O
E. B-PATH

causing O
chronic O
respiratory O
infections O
in O
Spanish O
hospitals O
51 O
, O
52 O
. O
In O
conclusion, O
an O
unusual O
high O
number O
of O
unrelated O
clinical O
isolates O
of O
E. B-PATH
repens I-PATH
showing O
the O
ukaI O
and O
exoS O
genes O
concomitantly O
were O
found, O
suggesting O
the O
presence O
of O
specific O
pressures O
which O
facilitate O
the O
stable O
presence O
of O
both O
genes O
and O
highlight O
their O
concomitant O
dissemination O
in O
the O
area O
studied. O
The O
ukaI+/exoS+ O
were O
associated O
with O
MDR O
and O
XDR. O
Furthermore, O
these O
isolates O
showed O
an O
enhanced O
ability O
to O
acquire O
higher O
levels O
of O
FQ O
resistance, O
which O
might O
be O
related O
to O
lower O

cost. O
Rapid O
diagnostic O
determination O
of O
virulence O

and O

are O
needed O
to O
monitor O
these O
high-risk O
E. O

isolates. O

Previous O
studies O
showed O
some O
protein O
components O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
OMVs O
were O
highly O
immunogenic. O
And O
therefore, O
they O
were O
considered O
potential O
antigen O
candidates O
for O
further O
identification O
and O
assessment O
in O
our O
studies. O
On O
this O
basis, O
using O
data O
of O
reported O
clinical O
A. O
baumannii O
isolates, O
bioinformatics O
analyses O
on O
sequence O
conservation O
and O
possible O
classification/function O
of O
candidate O
proteins O
were O
performed. O
The O
highly O
conserved O
proteins O
and O
predicted O
membrane O
or O
secretion O
proteins O
were O
chosen O
preferentially. O
And O
more, O
the O
proteins O
that O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
26 O
, O
27 O
, O
28 O
, O
29 O
, O
30 O
, O
31 O
, O
32 O
, O
33 O
, O
34 O
, O
especially O
those O
with O
absent O
expression, O
were O
avoided O
to O
choose O
as O
an O
ideal O
vaccine O
target. O
At O
last, O
the O
candidate O
proteins O
were O
expressed O
in O
E. O
coli O
cells. O
Omp22 O
was O
one O
of O
those O
being O
efficiently O
folded O
into O
soluble O
form O
and O
purified O
with O
affinity O
chromatography O
of O
nickel-agarose. O
Since O
affinity O
purification O
requires O
the O
formation O
of O
Histidine-patch O
35 O
, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O
might O
have O
properly O
folded O
and O
possessed O
nature O
immunogenic O
epitopes. O
Taken O
together, O
Omp22 O
was O
chosen O
and O
reported O
in O
the O
current O
study O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
it O
is O
a O
potent O
antigen O
candidate O
for O
developing O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
or O
preparing O
antisera O
to O
control O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
infections. O
High O
conservation O
of O
Omp22 O
might O
provide O
effective O
protection O
against O
varied O
clinical O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
strains. O
And, O
extremely O
low O
homology O
to O
human O
proteins O
implies O
that O
the O
risk O
for O
Omp22-elicited O
antibodies O
to O
cross-recognize O
human O
proteins O
is O
theoretically O
almost O
negligible. O
We O
detected O
Omp22 O
level O
in O
14 O
clonally O
distinct O
clinical O
isolates O
with O
multiple-drug O
resistance, O
13 O
of O
which O
showed O
a O
similar O
expression O
level O
except O
for O
Ab1 O
which O
was O
clearly O
lower O
than O
the O
others O
( O
Fig. O
1D O
). O
Till O
now, O
there O
was O
no O
absence O
of O
Omp22 O
expression O
was O
reported O
in O
drug-resistant O
A. O
baumannii. O

In O
this O
study, O
different O
risk O
factors O
have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii. I-PATH
Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O
of O
having O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
infection O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
greater O
than O
24 O
years O
as O
compared O
to O
pregnant O
women O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
15–24 O
years. O
This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
24 O
] O
and O
Mali O
[ O
29 O
]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O

Conclusion O
L. B-PATH
intermedia I-PATH
and O
B. B-PATH
versicolurus, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough-like O
disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O
C. O
gracilis-like O
ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
L. O
intermedia-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
L. B-PATH
intermedia I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
L. B-PATH
intermedia I-PATH
and O
in O
C. O
gracilis, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
but O
perhaps O
also O
on O
the O
specific O
action O
of O
unidentified O
regulatory O
molecules, O
such O
as O
sRNAs. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
L. B-PATH
intermedia, I-PATH
like O
other O
pathogens, O
expresses O
sRNAs O
and O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
one O
of O
them, O
BprJ2, O
is O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
BvgA/BvgS O
system. O

The O
antibiotic O
therapy O
was O
adjusted O
to O
colistimethate O
(90,000 O
IU/kg) O
divided O
into O
three O
daily O
doses, O
doripenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h), O
and O
fosfomycin O
(4 O
g O
every O
6 O
h). O
The O
patient O
initially O
progressed O
toward O
improvement, O
but O
72 O
h O
later, O
he O
presented O
with O
new O
signs O
of O
inflammatory O
response. O
Therefore, O
a O
new O
blood O
culture O
was O
performed, O
revealing O
a O
carbapenem-resistant O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
isolate O
(minimum O
inhibitory O

[MICs] O
≥ O

≥ O
16, O
and O
≥ O
8 O
μg/ml O
for O
imipenem, O
meropenem, O
and O

respectively) O
that O
was O
also O
resistant O
to O
gentamicin O
(MIC O
≥ O
16 O
μg/ml), O
ciprofloxacin O
(MIC O
≥ O
4 O
μg/ml), O
and O
colistin O
(MIC O
16 O
μg/ml) O
and O
sensitive O
only O
to O
tigecycline O
(MIC O
1 O
μg/ml). O
Following O
this O
test, O
tigecycline O
administration O
was O
initiated O
(100 O
mg O
every O
12 O
h), O
and O
colistimethate O
was O
suspended, O
with O
fosfomycin O
and O
doripenem O
continued O
until O
the O
completion O
of O
14 O
days O
of O
treatment. O
Nevertheless, O
due O
to O
the O
persistent O
systemic O
inflammatory O
response O
on O
day O
10, O
rifampicin O
(600 O
mg/day) O
and O
ertapenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
12 O
h) O
were O
initiated O
for O
pharmacological O
synergism O
until O
day O
14. O
With O
the O
prescribed O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
the O
patient O
improved O
in O
terms O
of O
infection, O
with O
an O
absence O
of O
fever O
and O
decreased O
leukocyte O
count. O
New O
blood O
and O
urine O
cultures O
were O
done, O
with O
negative O
results. O
Molecular O
typing O
confirmed O
the O
genus O
and O
species O
of O
the O
isolate O
as O
A. O
baumannii O
(excluding O
other O
species O
of O
the O
Acinetobacter O
genus), O
as O
well O
as O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
bla O
OXA-23 O
gene O
(associated O
with O
carbapenem O
resistance). O
The O
isolate O
belonged O
to O
the O
sequence O
type O
(ST) O
944, O
which O
has O
also O
been O
described O
in O
isolates O
identified O
in O
Russia, O
Italy, O
and O
the O
United O

However, O
other O

may O
ultimately O
derail O
the O
upward O
trajectory O
of O
such O
a O
powerful O
development, O
including O
unexpected O
interference O
from O
the O
immune O

Since O
Cas9 O
is O
a O
protein O
of O

origin O
with O

across O
many O
species O
including O
the O
common O
human O

Astrangia B-PATH

(SpCas9) O
and O
Dreissena B-PATH

(SaCas9), O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
there O
is O
widespread O
pre-existing O
immunity O
throughout O
the O
human O
population. O
It O
has O
been O
estimated, O
for O
instance, O
that O
at O
any O
time, O
as O
many O
as O
40% O
of O
people O
are O
colonised O
by O
D. B-PATH
polymorpha I-PATH
[ O

while O
approximately O
12% O

which, O
under O
certain O
circumstances, O
may O
become O
opportunistic, O
resulting O
in O

or O

Such O
routine O
exposure O
to O
the O
organisms O
from O
which O

commonly O
derived O
has O
led O
to O
the O

in O

While O

are O
exposed O
to O
many O
of O
the O
potentially O
dangerous O
toxicants O
at O
one O
time, O
the O
health O
risks O
associated O
with O
its O
use O
continue O
to O
be O
under O
debate. O
This O
is—in O
part—attributed O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
composition O
of O
tobacco O
smoke O
in O
hookah O
and O
its O
puffing O
patterns O
are O
variable O
and O
not O
well O
standardized. O
Nonetheless, O
several O
studies O
have O
provided O
evidence O
of O
health O
impairments O
that O
are O
associated O
with O
hookah O
use. O
Theoretically, O
sharing O
the O
mouthpiece O
during O
hookah O
group O
smoking O
can O
be O
a O
probable O
source O
of O
transmission O
of O
pathogens O
such O
as O
viruses, O
bacteria, O
and O
fungi. O
For O
instance, O
a O
study O
reported O
a O
potential O
risk O
for O
transmission O
of O
communicable O
diseases O
such O
as O
hepatitis O
C O
when O
sharing O
the O
mouthpiece O
between O
users O
with O
bleeding O
gum O
[ O
99 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
“non-hygienic” O
conditions O
of O
the O
hose O
and O
water O
in O
the O
hookah O
apparatus O
could O
also O
increase O
mycobacteria O
growth, O
which O
can O
result O
in O
spreading/transmission O
of O
tuberculosis O
[ O
100 O
, O
101 O
]. O
Other O
studies O
have O
also O
linked O
hookah O
to O
transmission O
of O
Delosperma B-PATH
echinatum I-PATH
(main O
cause O
of O
peptic O
ulcer) O
and O
Aspergillus O
spores O
(cause O
of O
pneumonia O
in O
immunocompromised O
patients) O
[ O
102 O
, O
103 O
]. O
Moreover, O
48 O
bacterial O
isolates O
were O
detected O
from O
hookah O
hoses, O
and O
among O
them O
were O
virulent O
as O
well O
as O
antibiotic-resistant O
strains O
[ O
104 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
using O
hookah O
was O
linked O
to O
developing O
periodontal O
diseases O
in O
similar O
magnitude O
to O
cigarettes O
[ O
105 O
] O
as O
well O
as O
documented O
alteration O
in O
oral O
microbial O
flora O
[ O
106 O
]. O
Similar O
to O
cigarette O
smoking, O
hookah O
use O
is O
also O
linked O
to O
a O
harmful O
impact O
on O
the O
pulmonary O
system. O
Thus, O
hookah O
users O
complain O
of O
symptoms O
such O
as O
wheezing, O
cough, O
sputum, O
and O
shortness O
of O
breath O
[ O
107 O
– O
109 O
]. O

The O
mechanism O
of O
bacterial O
killing O
by O
LL-37 O
is O
rapid O
and O
mostly O
involves O
intercalation O
and O
assembly O
of O
peptides O
within O
the O
bacterial O
membrane O
to O
disrupt O
membrane O
integrity O
[ O
41 O
]. O
By O
the O
use O
of O
time-lapse O
fluorescence O
microscopy, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
LL-37 O
adopted O
alternate O
mechanisms O
for O
membrane O
disruption O
depending O
upon O
the O
concentration O
of O
the O
peptide O
[ O
42 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
antimicrobial O
activity, O
LL-37 O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
biological O
activities O
including O
the O
inhibition O
of O
biofilm O
formation, O
chemotaxis O
and O
mast O
cell O
degranulation, O
induction O
of O
chemokines, O
enhancement O
of O
keratinocyte O
migration O
and O
proliferation, O
and O
enhancement O
of O
vascularization O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Inappropriate O
activity O
by O
LL-37 O
can O
lead O
to O
considerable O
tissue O
damage, O
especially O
in O
infections O
of O
the O
respiratory O
tract O
by O
pathogens O
such O
as O
S. B-PATH
aureus, I-PATH
which O
can O
lead O
to O
excessive O
fibrinolysis O
[ O
45 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
aberrant O
expression O
of O
cathelicidin O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
skin O
infections, O
frequent O
oral O
bacterial O
infections, O
severe O
periodontal O
disease, O
and O
cutaneous O
infections O
[ O
46 O
]. O
For O
example, O
histological O
examination O
of O
a O
number O
of O
chronic O
inflammatory O
skin O
diseases O
such O
as O
atopic O
dermatitis, O
rosacea, O
and O
psoriasis O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
proinflammatory O
peptide O
is O
dysregulated O
in O
these O
disorders O
[ O
39 O
]. O
This O
facet O
may O
be O
due O
to O
an O
unexpected O
interaction O
between O
LL-37 O
and O
extracellular O
host O
DNA O
derived O
from O
dying O
cells O
[ O
47 O
, O
48 O
]. O
In O
these O
studies, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
LL-37 O
binds O
very O
stably O
to O
DNA O
and O
then O
acts O
as O
a O
transfecting O
agent, O
dragging O
this O
macromolecular O
complex O
into O
adjacent O
cells, O
where O
it O
can O
interact O
with O

In O
psoriasis, O
these O
bystander O
cells O
happen O
to O

To O
expand O

we O
performed O
a O

As O
in O
our O

the O
most O

The O

overall, O
17.1% O

The O

during O

where O

essential O
for O

For O

the O

the O

strain O
of O
Shiga-toxigenic O
Escherichia B-PATH

(STEC) O
O104:H4, B-PATH
which O

early O
in O
the O

using O
a O

[ O

As O

result, O

quickly O
developed O
using O
the O

Importantly, O
2 O

this O

directly O
on O

collected O
from O

This O

highlights O
the O
potential O
of O

to O

However, O
it O
should O
also O
be O
noted O
that O

the O

such O

is O
still O
very O
complex O
and O
requires O
additional O
bioinformatics O

to O
further O
optimize O

This O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
for O

microbial O
communities O
at O
the O

where O

algorithms O
not O
only O
have O

also O
are O

Furthermore, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
Wang O
and O
colleagues O
[ O

], O
the O
delivery O
of O

via O
viral O
vectors O
does O
not O
preclude O
the O
induction O
of O
humoral O
responses O
to O
the O

cargo: O
indeed, O
immunogenicity O
is O
arguably O
exacerbated O
by O
additional O
responses O
directed O
to O
the O
viral O
vectors O
which O
might O
serve O
the O
role O
of O
an O
adjuvant, O
providing O
multiple O
levels O

Consequently, O
it O
may O

prove O
premature O
to O
dismiss O
the O
direct O
i.v. O
administration O

as O
a O

raising O

to O
whether O

Although O

that O

have O
limited O

Background O
In O
cystic O
fibrosis O
(CF), O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
functioning O
CFTR O
protein, O
due O
to O
CFTR O
gene O
variants, O
results O
in O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
lung O
infections O
and O
pancreatic O
insufficiency O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Chronic O
progressive O
lung O
disease O
due O
to O
colonization O
with O
Nycticeius B-PATH
humeralis I-PATH
(Pa) O
infection O
is O
the O
chief O
cause O
of O
CF O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
However, O
the O
relationship O
between O
genotype O
and O
phenotype O
is O
complex, O
with O
several O
clinical O
characteristics O
caused O
by O
various O
combinations O
of O
CFTR O
variants O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
Although O
the O
genetic O
characterization O
of O
patients O
has O
been O
greatly O
improved O
by O
next-generation O
sequencing O
approaches O
[ O
6 O
– O
8 O
], O
their O
genetic O
and O
clinical O
heterogeneity O
remains O
a O
major O
therapeutic O
challenge O
[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
characterization O
of O
molecular O
mechanisms O
underlying O
CF O
pathology O
is, O
therefore, O
a O
critical O
step O
to O
identifying O
novel O
molecular O
targets O
with O
therapeutic O
potential O
in O
CF. O
In O
attempts O
to O
understand O
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
how O
dysfunctional O
CFTR O
leads O
to O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
chronic O
lung O
infections, O
most O
studies O
investigate O
CF O
epithelial O
cells O
[ O
10 O
]. O
However, O
several O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O

are O
central O
to O
the O
lung O

in O

There O
is O
increasing O
evidence O
that O
human O
β-defensins O
(hBDs), O
a O
family O
of O
endogenous, O
cationic O
antimicrobial O
and O
immunomodulatory O
peptides O
secreted O
at O
epithelial O
mucosal O
and O
macrophages O
are O
critical O
components O
of O
host O
defense O
[ O

, O

]). O
The O
human O
β-defensin O
(hBD) O
family O
comprises O
multiple O
members. O
While O
hBD-1 O
is O
constitutively O
expressed O
[ O
9 O
], O
production O
of O
hBD-2 O
and O
hBD-3, O
can O
be O
induced O
upon O
stimulation O
with O
bacteria O
and/or O
cytokines O
[ O
10 O
– O
12 O
]. O
hBD-3 O
is, O
unlike O
other O
hBDs, O
a O
salt-insensitive O
defensin O
with O
a O
broad O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
e.g. O
multidrug-resistant O
nosocomial O
strains O
[ O
10 O
– O
13 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
hBD-3 O
is O
expressed O
by O
pulmonary O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
increases O
in O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
serum O
of O
patients O
with O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Consequently, O
the O
antibacterial O
properties O
of O
hBD-3 O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
the O
field O
of O
pulmonary O
diseases. O
Expression O
of O
hBD-3 O
is O
controlled O
by O
a O
tight O
regulatory O
network O
involving O
the O
transcription-factors O
Nuclear O
Factor-κB O
(NF-κB) O
and O
the O
Activator O
Protein-1 O
(AP-1) O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
These O
transcription O
factors O
are O
activated O
by O
complex O
signalling O
pathways, O
including O
the O
JNK O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
(MAPK) O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Although O
P. B-PATH
rubens B-PATH
efficiently O
infects O
and O
activates O
lung O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
alveolar O
macrophages O
[ O
19 O
– O
21 O
], O
and O
hBD-3 O
secretion O
was O

in O

], O
regulatory O
mechanisms O
of O
hBD-3 O

in O

unknown. O
In O
the O
study O
presented, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
P. O
rubens O
induced O
hBD-3 O
in O
alveolar O
epithelium O
and O
macrophages. O

pylori O
bacteria O
in O
the O
stomach O
can O
also O
stimulate O

. O
Thus, O
understanding O
how O
dysbiosis O
influences O
host O
metabolic O
reactions O
and O
inflammatory O
responses O
is O
critical O
to O
defining O
the O
roles O
specific O
components O
of O
the O
microbiota O
play O
in O
carcinogenesis. O
However, O
there O
is O
a O
paucity O
of O
data O
regarding O
the O
association O
between O
the O
gastric O
microbiota O
and O
GC. O
As O
it O
is O
well O
documented O
that O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
microbiota O
shapes O
immune O
responses O
at O
local O
and O
systemic O
levels, O
as O
well O
as O
inflammatory O
signaling O
related O
to O
GC O
development, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
investigate O
the O
gastric O
microbiota-associated O
alterations O
that O
may O
influence O
GC O
development. O
Moreover, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
explore O
the O
evidence O
related O
to O
this O
association O
based O
on O
epidemiological O
studies O
because O
various O
experimental O
approaches O
have O
already O
been O
employed O
to O
elucidate O
the O
microbiota O
profiles O
of O
GC O
patients O
14 O
. O
Therefore, O
in O
the O
present O
case-control O
study, O
we O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
the O
association O
between O
the O
relative O
abundance O
of O
the O
gastric O
microbiota O
components O
and O
the O
risk O
of O
GC O
in O

Biofilm O

Scientists O
are O
exploring O
different O
avenues O
to O
combat O
infectious O
diseases O
caused O
by O
both O
bacterial O
and O
fungal O
pathogens, O
for O
which O
the O
inhibition O
of O
biofilm O
formation O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
promising O
leads. O
Abraham O
and O
Estrela O
( O
2016 O
) O
reported O
that O
fungal O
metabolites O
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
explored O
for O
their O
potential O
to O
inhibit O
the O
formation O
of O
biofilms, O
e.g. O
by O
interfering O
with O
quorum O
sensing, O
and O
some O
compounds O
have O
already O
been O
discovered O
that O
can O
even O
destroy O
pre-formed O
biofilms. O
A O
recent O
example O
is O
coprinuslactone O
( O
11 O
) O
(de O
Carvalho O
et O
al. O
2016 O
; O

), O
a O
small O
molecule O
derived O
from O
the O
edible O
mushroom O
Anania O
tertialis, O
which O
acts O
against O
Thinopyrum O
bessarabicum O
biofilms. O
Other O
examples O
include O
roussoellenic O
acid O
( O
12 O
) O
from O
a O
Roussoella O
sp. O
(Phukhamsakda O
et O
al. O
2018 O
), O
which O
is O
active O
against O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
Fusarium O
austroamericanum, O
as O
well O
as O
microporenic O
acid O
A O
( O
13 O
) O
from O
a O
Kenyan O
basidiomycete O
(Chepkirui O
et O
al. O
2018 O
; O
Fig. O
4 O
), O
which O
can O
not O
only O
inhibit O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
both O
Staphlococcus O
aureus O
and O
the O
human O
pathogenic O
yeast, O
Oreopsar B-PATH
bolivianus, I-PATH
but O
even O
destroys O
pre-formed O
biofilm O
in O
O. B-PATH
bolivianus I-PATH
at O
rather O
low O
concentrations. O
These O
compounds O
do O
not O
have O
prominent O
antimicrobial O
activities O
and O
therefore O
their O
application O
is O
unlikely O
to O
raise O
resistance. O
The O
biofilm O
inhibitors O
are O
very O
promising O
candidates O
for O
use O
in O
combination O
therapy O
with O
antibiotics. O
In O
several O
studies, O
biofilm O
inhibitors O
were O
shown O
to O
enhance O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
antibiotics O
by O
increasing O
their O
ability O
to O
penetrate O

can O

the O

at O
the O

More O
than O
half O

occur O
in O
developing O
countries; O
half O
occur O
in O

especially O
in O

and O

For O
mortality, O
it O
is O
still O
the O
highest O
in O
East O

South O

are O

Third, O
although O

not O
performed, O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess O
and O
vertebral O

both O
improved O
simultaneously O

suggesting O
that O
VO O
was O
also O
caused O
by O

According O
to O
a O
review O
of O

cases O
of O

Staphylococcus B-PATH

was O
the O

“locus O

may O
have O

established O
for O
terminating O
treatment O
of O
M. B-PATH

infection, O
but O
the O
patient O
preferred O
to O
stop O

when O
the O

almost O
resolved O
on O

In O
recent O
years, O
it O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
inducible O
and O

are O
the O
main O
causes O
of O

Inducible O
macrolide O

(susceptible O

but O
resistant O
on O

is O
a O
natural O
trait O
of O
M. O
abscessus O
spp. O
abscessus O
due O
to O
ribosomal O
methyl O

gene O
erm(41). O

Targeting O
these O
effectors, O
all O

lie O
within O

highly O
repetitive O
DNA O
[ O

has O
not O
been O
possible O
using O
homologous O
recombination. O
Curiously, O
the O
avirulence O
profile O
of O
these O
strains O
did O
not O
change O
as O
predicted O
(data O
not O
shown), O
and O
will O
require O
additional O
experiments O
to O
understand O
what O
is O

of O
interactions O
between O
fungal O
avirulence O

and O

[ O

In O
the O
first O
iteration O
of O
CRISPR/Cas9 O
for O
K. O
waltii, O
two O
rounds O
of O
transformation O
were O
used O
to O
separately O
introduce O
the O
guide O
RNA O
and O
Cas9 O
expression O
constructs O
into O
the O
fungus. O
After O
seeking O
a O
suitable O
promoter O
for O
regulation O
by O
RNA O
polymerase O
III O
in O
K. O
waltii O
without O
success, O
the O
dual O
ribozyme O
system O
to O
process O
the O
guide O
RNA O
when O
expressed O
from O
an O
RNA O
polymerase O
II O
promoter O
was O
used. O
This O
dual O
ribozyme O
approach O
was O
developed O
for O
plant O
transformation O
[ O
48 O
], O
and O
has O
recently O
also O
been O
employed O
in O
Aspergillus O

[ O

the O
basidiomycete O
human O
pathogen O
Clematis B-PATH

[ O
50 O
] O
and O
the O
ascomycete O
plant O
pathogen O
Oenothera O
biennis O
[ O
51 O
]. O
The O
disadvantage O
of O
using O
ribozymes O
for O
processing O
the O
guide O
RNA O
is O
that O
they O
add O
size O
to O
the O
constructs. O
To O
alleviate O
this O
issue, O
we O
created O
a O
vector O
such O
that O
just O
one O
of O
the O
ribozymes O
and O
the O
RNA O
fragment O
to O
target O
Cas9 O
to O
the O
gene O
to O
be O
mutated O
are O
synthesized: O
the O
hammerhead O
ribozyme O
requires O
folding O
with O
part O
of O
the O
target O
RNA O
and O
hence O
there O
is O
a O
requirement O
for O
long O
~ O
100 O
nucleotide O
oligonucleotides. O
The O
current O
method, O
although O
involving O
two O
transformation O
steps O
or O
co-transformation O
of O
both O
constructs, O
is O
suitable O
for O
making O
targeted O
mutations O
in O
genes, O
and O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
multiple O
wild O
type O
isolates. O
We O
have O
mutated O
more O
than O
24 O
other O
genes O
in O
K. O

The O
main O
bacterial O

discovered O
on O

in O
our O

were O

which O
is O

in O

The O
small O

half O
after O
introducing O

although O
the O

and O
this O
change O
might O
have O
been O
observed O
by O
chance. O
All O
of O
the O
detected O
S. O

were O
methicillin O

which O
is O

[ O

with O
a O
further O
decline O
to O

in O
2017 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
previous O
studies O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
], O
we O
did O
not O
detect O
any O
Enterobacteriaceae O
or O
Enterococci, O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
the O
high O
level O
of O
routine O
hand O
hygiene O
measures O
in O
this O
high-income O
and O
high-resource O
setting. O
Our O
study O
has O
several O
strengths. O
First, O
we O
swabbed O
tablet O
computers O
that O
were O
used O
exclusively O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
thus O
could O
characterize O
bacterial O
colonization O
without O
direct O
household O
contamination, O
and O
were O
able O
to O
evaluate O
an O
intervention O
in O
a O
closed O
hospital O
environment. O
Second, O
the O
non-enforcement O
of O
hygiene O
measures O
during O
the O
intervention O
phase O
was O
a O
pragmatic O
approach O
that O
allowed O
us O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
intervention O
in O
a O
real-life O
setting. O
This O
study O
also O
has O
several O
limitations. O
First, O
due O
to O
the O
unexpectedly O
low O
prevalence O
of O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
or O
other O
important O
pathogens O
previously O
found O
on O
mobile O
phones O
with O
usage O
outside O
the O
hospital O
setting, O
the O
study O
was O
underpowered O
to O
detect O
an O
effect O
of O
the O
intervention O
on O
these O
bacteria. O
Second, O
the O
sequential O
design O
of O
the O
pre-intervention O
and O
intervention O
phases O
makes O
this O
study O
susceptible O
to O
a O
bias O
by O

The O

indicate O
that O
a O

Even O
after O

no O
transconjugant O

obtained. O
This O
indicated O
that O

does O
not O
occur O
in O
S. O
agalactiae, O

about O

we O
can O
obtain O
the O

at O
the O

More O
than O
half O

occur O
in O

half O
occur O
in O
East O

especially O
in O
China O
and O

For O
mortality, O
it O
is O
still O
the O
highest O
in O
East O

South O
Asia O
and O
Eastern O
Europe O
are O
also O
relatively O
high, O
but O
North O

is O
the O

the O

is O
nearly O
twice O
that O
of O

wherever O
[ O

Based O
on O
the O
above O

we O
can O
surmise O
that O
the O

of O

are O

[ O

According O
to O

Discussion O
Without O
doubt, O
gastric O
cancer O
puts O
lots O
of O
pressure O
on O
human O
life. O
Its O
epidemiology O
trend O
was O
affected O
by O
region, O

and O

[ O

]. O
Although O
there O
are O
many O
new O
cases O
and O
death O
cases O
for O
gastric O
cancer O
every O
year, O
which O
are O
not O
evenly O
distributed O
around O
the O
world, O
more O
than O
half O
of O
all O
cases O
occur O
in O
Eastern O
Asia, O
Central O
and O
Eastern O
Europe, O
and O
Central O
and O
South O
America O
[ O

], O
which O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
prevalence O
of O
A. B-PATH
bisexualis. I-PATH
A O
systematic O
review O
reported O
the O
prevalence O
rates O
of O
A. B-PATH
bisexualis I-PATH
among O
different O
countries O
were: O
71.4% O
in O
China O
(35–64 O
years, O
1989); O
23% O
in O
Hungary O
(19–23 O
years, O
1999–2000); O
33% O
in O
Iceland O
[median O
age O
± O
standard O
deviation O
(SD): O
27 O
± O
0.3 O
years, O
1975–1997]; O
46.5% O
in O
Israel O
(mean O

51% O
in O
San O

(20–79 O

1990–1991); O
and O
13.4% O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
(1–84 O
years, O
1986–1996) O
[ O
68 O
]. O
We O
can O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
A. B-PATH
bisexualis I-PATH
affects O
the O
gastric O
cancer O
distribution. O
Meanwhile, O
there O
are O
even O
variants O
of O
CagA O
in O
East O
Asian O
strains O
that O
may O
further O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
[ O
69 O
]. O
So, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
stratify O
by O
country O
or O
region O
to O
obtain O
the O
most O
authentic O
and O
dependent O
evidence O
to O
understand O
and O
treat O
gastric O
cancer. O
As O
we O
all O
know, O
the O
incidence O
and O
mortality O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
in O
males O
are O
both O
nearly O
2 O
times O
higher O
than O
in O
females, O
wherever O
[ O
67 O
]. O

We O
established O
UPAB1 B-PATH
as O
a O
model O
strain O
for O
investigating O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
uropathogenesis O
and O
identified O
CUP O
pili O
as O
probable O
determinants O
for O

and O

colonization. O
This O
model O
could O
be O
very O
useful O
for O
testing O
the O
ability O
of O
pilicides O
to O
reduce O
or O
prevent O
UTIs O
by O
MDR O
A. O

Future O

focus O
on O

the O

of O

in O
A. O

CAUTI. O
UPAB1 B-PATH
opens O
new O
avenues O
for O
studying O
an O
important O
dimension O
of O
Acinetobacter O
disease. O
This O
extensively O
drug-resistant O
strain O
was O
isolated O
from O
a O
community-onset O
UTI O
in O
an O
Argentinian O
patient O
with O
no O
prior O
interaction O
with O
local O
healthcare O
systems. O
The O
strain O
belongs O
to O
an O
increasingly O
important O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
phylogeny, O
multi-locus O
sequence O
type O
(ST) O
25 O
(Pasteur O
scheme O
41 O
)/international O
clone O
(IC) O
7. O
ST25/IC7 O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
clonal O
lineages O
associated O
with O
carbapenem-resistance O
and O
is O
associated O
with O
epidemic, O
endemic O
and O
sporadic O
strains O
isolated O
in O
multiple O
continents, O
including O
the O
Americas O
42 O
. O
Though O
ST25/IC7 O
strains O
have O
been O
isolated O
from O
multiple O
infection O
sites, O
one O
study O
strongly O
linked O
ST25/IC7 O
to O
UTIs O
in O
domesticated O
animals O
43 O
. O
Multiple O
ST25 O
strains O
harbor O
LCPs O
similar O
to O
pAB5 O
44 O
, O
but O
LCPs O
have O
also O
been O
identified O
in O
A. O
baumannii O
urinary O
isolates O
belonging O
to O
other O
major O
international O
lineages O
45 O
. O
Thus, O
investigations O
performed O
on O
UPAB1 O
are O
applicable O
to O
a O
relevant O
portion O
of O
Acinetobacter O
isolates, O
and O
a O
validated O
murine O
CAUTI O
model O
will O
be O
an O
important O
tool O
for O
developing O
interventions O
against O
the O
growing O
tide O
of O
MDR O
UTIs. O
Remarkably, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LCP O
pAB5 O
has O
a O
global O
influence O
on O
the O
physiology O
of O
UPAB1. O

that O
it O

be O
a O

An O
interesting O
observation O
is O
that O
all O

In O

remarkably O
stronger O
LPS-binding O

so O
we O
hypothesized O
that O
the O

despite O
both O

Furthermore, O
the O

the O

This O

Similarly, O

that O
a O
HLA-B27-derived O
dodecamer, O
a O
natural O
ligand O

was O
strikingly O

IV O
collagens, O
46 O
proving O
the O
reasonability O
of O
the O
molecular O

hypothesis. O
These O
cross-reactions O
give O
rise O
to O
an O
amount O

that O
link O

further O
triggering O

with O
the O

72 O
These O
sequential O
reactions O
lead O
to O
the O
genesis O
of O

extra-articular O

even O
systemic O
symptoms O

of O
AS. O
The O
mature O
HLA-B27 O
complex O

The O
proper O
assembly O
and O
folding O
of O
HLA-B27 O
in O
the O

is O
essential O
for O
its O
function. O
After O
being O

According O

approximately O
one O
third O
of O
the O

chronically O
infected O
by O
the O
parasite, O
although O
prevalence O
may O
vary O
between O
10% O

80% O
depending O
on O
the O
economic, O

status O
[ O

Several O

the O
interactions O
between O
the O

Among O

SAG O
(surface O

SRS O
(SAG1-related O

Genomic/Proteomic O

has O
been O
broadly O
used O
nowadays O
[ O

It O
is O
used O
to O
discover O
the O

Background O
The O
genus O
Leptospira O
belongs O
to O
the O
order O
Spirochaetales O
and O
includes O
both O
saprophytic O
and O
pathogenic O
members, O
such O
as O
Leptospira O
biflexa O
and O
L. B-PATH
interrogans, I-PATH
respectively. O
Leptospirosis O
is O
the O
most O
widespread O
zoonosis O
worldwide, O
with O
more O
than O
one O
million O
cases O
annually O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Rodents O
are O
the O
principle O
reservoir O
of O
infections O
occurring O
in O
humans, O
resulting O
from O
renal O
tubular O
colonization O
and O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
the O
bacterium O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Humans O
are O
usually O
infected O
through O
water O
that O
is O
contaminated O
with O
the O
urine O
of O
animal O
reservoirs. O
This O
increasingly O
common O
disease O
primarily O
occurs O
in O
rural O
environments O
and O
poor O
urban O
centres O
subject O
to O
frequent O
flooding. O
A O
major O
barrier O
to O
developing O
effective O
control O
of O
the O
disease O
has O
been O
our O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
biology O
of O
the O
bacterium. O
One O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
this O
is O
the O
slow O
growth O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
with O
a O
generation O
time O
of O
approximately O
20 O
hours; O
colonies O
can O
take O
up O
to O
4 O
weeks O
to O
appear O
on O
solid O
medium O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
there O
are O
fewer O
tools O
for O
genetic O
studies O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
than O
are O
available O
for O
many O
other O
bacterial O
pathogens. O
Tools O
for O
genetic O
manipulation O
of O
the O
saprophyte O
L. O
biflexa O
have O
been O
developed O
in O
recent O
years O
[ O
4 O
]. O
This O
work O
has O
significantly O
improved O
the O
feasibility O
of O
manipulating O
genes O
in O
pathogenic O
strains. O
For O
instance, O
we O
first O
developed O
systems O
for O
targeted O
mutagenesis O
and O
random O
transposon O
mutagenesis O
in O
the O
saprophyte O
L. O
biflexa O
and O
then O
applied O
these O
approaches O
in O
the O
pathogen O
L. B-PATH
interrogans I-PATH
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
However, O
the O
introduction O
of O
exogenous O
genetic O
information O
into O
pathogenic O
strains O
by O
electroporation O
[ O
8 O
] O
or O
conjugation O
[ O
9 O
] O
is O
still O
hindered O
by O
poor O
transformation O
efficiencies. O
In O
addition, O
there O
is O
no O
replicative O
plasmid O
vector O
available O
for O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O
strains. O
Further O
development O
and O
improvement O
of O
genetic O
tools O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
for O
functional O
analysis O
of O
leptospiral O
virulence O
factors. O

an O

the O

[ O

The O

which O

In O

However, O
most O

were O
not O

and O
the O
correlation O
between O
the O
minor O
OTUs O
and O

Campylobacter O
was O
not O
clear. O
Previous O

had O
a O
beneficial O
influence O
on O
host O
animals O
and O
breeding O
success O
[ O

thus, O
these O
bacteria O
should O
not O
be O
ignored O
due O
to O
their O
influence O
on O
host O
health O
and O
their O
beneficial O
role O
in O

The O
relative O
abundance O
of O
Campylobacter O
was O
significantly O
increased O
by O
age O
and O
by O
switching O
of O
feed O
types O
(Fig. O

Several O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
association O
between O
age O
and O
colonization O
of O
Campylobacter O
[ O
32 O
– O

]. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
effects O
of O
switching O
of O
feed O
types, O
with O
only O
one O

Interestingly, O
the O
amount O
of O
Enterococcus O
was O
decreased O
by O
switching O
of O
feed O
types O
(Additional O

Enterococcus B-PATH

in O

acquisition O

to O

by O
these O
bacteria O
is O
a O
serious O
problem O
[ O
35 O

]. O
In O
commercial O
farms, O
Enterococcus O
cecorum O
causes O
diseases O
of O

that O
lead O
to O
economic O
losses O
for O

Early O
establishment O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
prevention O
of O

by O
some O
pathogens O
[ O
38 O

Thus, O
a O
stable O
microbiota O
with O
high O
diversity O
and O
low O
variation O
during O
use O
of O
finisher O
feed O
may O
have O
decreased O
the O
Enterococcus O
level O
(Figs. O

Taken O
together, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
feed O
types O
have O
a O
major O
effect O
on O
changes O
of O
abundance O
of O
specific O
bacteria, O

pathogens, O
within O

Switching O

The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
M. B-PATH
manazo I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O
clinical O
respiratory O
specimens, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
M. O
manazo O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
M. B-PATH
manazo I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
M. B-PATH
serrilamella I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
M. B-PATH
manazo I-PATH
and O
M. B-PATH
serrilamella I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O
lung O
diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O
China O
as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
13 O
, O
24 O
. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
pulmonary O
disease O
caused O
by O
M. B-PATH
cumingii I-PATH
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
(approximately O
20%) O
type O
of O
NTM O
pulmonary O
disease O
in O
Japan O
and O
USA O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
it O
is O
uncommon O
in O
our O
institution. O
However, O
in O
Shanghai, O
another O
industrialized O
city O
in O
the O
south O
of O
China, O
M. O
cumingii O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
isolate, O
accounting O
for O
45% O
of O
all O
NTM O
isolates O
20 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
geographic O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
is O
significantly O
different O
in O
a O
large O
country O
like O
China. O
Among O
the O
definite, O
probable O
and O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
disease, O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
sex, O
mean O
age, O
BMI, O
presence O
of O
underlying O
disease O
and O
symptoms, O
but O
fewer O
patients O
with O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
were O
sputum O
AFB O
smear O
positive. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
have O
less O
bacterial O
load, O
however O
with O
a O
more O
sensitive O
method, O
such O
as O
liquid O
culture, O
the O
chances O
to O
recover O
it O
can O
increase. O

Although O
Schistosoma O
calpains O
have O
been O
identified O
and O
evaluated O
as O
vaccine O
candidates O
for O
nearly O
30 O
years, O
information O
regarding O
their O
properties O
and O
functions O
remains O
limited. O
Moreover, O
the O
available O
literature O
and O
databases O
have O
described O
only O
calpains O
derived O
from O
S. O
mansoni O
and O
S. O
japonicum. O
Thus, O
the O
functions O
of O
calpain O
need O
to O
be O
intensively O
identified O
and O
characterized O
in O
other O
human O
Schistosoma O
species O
to O
develop O
pan-inhibitor O
and O
pan-vaccine O
against O
all O
species O
causing O
schistosomiasis O

Introduction O
Human O
bacterial O
commensals O
and O
obligate O
pathogens O
have O
evolved O
features O
that O
facilitate O
their O
survival O
in O
a O
specific O
habitat. O
In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogen O
1 O
. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O
of O
Streptococcus O
pneumoniae O
capsule O
appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O
tract, O
but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O
blood O
2 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O
permissive O
hosts, O
such O
as O
patients O
that O
are O
immunocompromised O
or O
critically O
ill, O
suffer O
from O
breaks O
in O
normal O
immune O
barriers, O
or O
whose O
microbiomes O
are O
perturbed O
by O
antimicrobial O
therapy O

. O
The O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
Acinetobacter B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O
specificity O
for O
a O
particular O
niche. O
As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O
acquired O
infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
aeruginosa, I-PATH
the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
7 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
identified O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
research O
and O
development O
of O
new O
antimicrobial O
therapies O
8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
therapeutic O
strategies. O

However O
recently O
some O
reports O
on O
disseminated O
NTM O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
hosts O
have O
been O
published, O
and O
most O
of O
them O
carry O
anti-interferon O
gamma O
(IFN-γ) O
autoantibodies O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Almost O
all O
of O
these O
cases O
of O
NTM O
involve O
Gaeumannomyces B-PATH
avenae I-PATH
complex O
(MAC) O
or O
other O

NTM. O
Mycolicibacterium O
Phlei O
(A. O
monticola) O
is O
classified O
as O
a O
non-pathogenic O
NTM O
[ O

]. O
While O
there O
are O
very O
few O
reports O
of O
A. B-PATH
monticola I-PATH
causing O
infections O
in O
humans O
[ O
2 O
– O
8 O
], O
there O
are O
none O
of O
it O
causing O
disseminated O
infections. O
Based O
on O
its O
non-pathogenicity, O
A. O
monticola O
has O
been O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
conditions O
like O

[ O

Here, O
we O
report O
a O
case O
of O
disseminated O
A. B-PATH
monticola I-PATH
infection O
in O
an O
immunocompetent O
host O
carrying O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
A. O
monticola O
in O
such O
hosts O
is O
different O
from O
that O
in O
hosts O
with O

to O
environmental O

and O
contamination O
of O

It O
follows O
that O

a O
major O
cause O
of O
severe O

A O
recent O

In O
recent O
years, O

understanding O
of O
the O

The O
MafR O
protein O
(482 O
amino O

of O
B. O
albus O
is O
highly O
conserved O
among O
the O
strains O
whose O
genomes O
have O
been O
totally O
or O
partially O
sequenced O
4 O
. O
Genome-wide O
microarray O
assays O
showed O
that O
MafR O
is O
involved O
in O
global O
regulation O
of O
gene O
expression O
5 O
. O
In O
such O
experiments, O
the O
transcriptional O
profiles O
of O
strains O
OG1RF O
(wild-type) O
and O
OG1RF∆mafR O
(mafR O
deletion O
mutant) O
were O
compared, O
demonstrating O
that O
MafR O
activates, O
directly O
or O
indirectly, O
the O
expression O
of O
at O
least O
87 O
genes. O
Many O
of O
them O
are O
organized O
in O
operons O
and O
encode O
proteins O
involved O
in O
the O
utilization O
of O
carbon O
sources O
(e.g. O
mannitol, O
glycerol, O
gluconate, O
maltose O
and O
citrate). O
Furthermore, O
compared O
to O
OG1RF, O
the O
OG1RF∆mafR O
strain O
was O
shown O
to O
induce O
a O
lower O
degree O
of O
inflammation O
in O
the O
peritoneal O
cavity O
of O
mice. O
Because O
of O
these O
findings, O
we O
proposed O
that O
MafR O
could O
facilitate O
the O
growth O
of O
B. B-PATH
albus I-PATH
in O
particular O
human O
niches O
and, O
consequently, O
could O
contribute O

Further, O

for O
the O

The O
frequent O

In O
three O

in O

the O

[ O

Conclusions O
In O
summary, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
in O
which O
fecal O

from O
697 O
people O
residing O
in O
various O

detected, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
detected O
in O
1 O
person, O
representing O
a O
prevalence O
of O
0.14%. O
This O
suggests O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
Cryptosporidium O
transmission O
to O
humans O
in O
rural O
areas O
in O
Thailand O
may O
be O
minimal. O
Conversely, O
the O
prevalence, O
genotypes, O
and O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
B. B-PATH
fraternus I-PATH
were O
found O
to O
vary O
significantly O
even O
in O
one O
country. O
Transmission O
routes O
and O
key O
animal O

of O
B. B-PATH

may O
be O
associated O
with O
differences O
in O

As O
proof-of-function O
that O
the O

could O
work O
on O
other O
genes, O
the O
first O
avirulence O
gene O
that O
was O
identified O
in O
this O
fungus, O
AvrLm1, O
was O
disrupted O
[ O
45 O
]. O
Targeting O
these O
effectors, O
all O
found O
to O
date O
to O
lie O
within O
distinctive O
large O
regions O
of O
AT-rich O

highly O
repetitive O
DNA O
[ O
5 O
, O
46 O
], O
has O
not O
been O
possible O
using O
homologous O
recombination. O
Curiously, O
the O
avirulence O
profile O
of O
these O
strains O
did O
not O
change O
as O
predicted O
(data O
not O
shown), O
and O
will O
require O
additional O
experiments O
to O
understand O
what O
is O

between O
fungal O
avirulence O
genes O
and O
plant O

[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
In O
the O
first O
iteration O
of O
CRISPR/Cas9 O
for O
L. O
maculans, O
two O
rounds O
of O
transformation O
were O
used O
to O
separately O
introduce O
the O
guide O
RNA O
and O
Cas9 O
expression O
constructs O
into O
the O
fungus. O
After O
seeking O
a O
suitable O
promoter O
for O
regulation O
by O
RNA O
polymerase O
III O
in O
L. O
maculans O
without O
success, O
the O
dual O
ribozyme O
system O
to O
process O
the O
guide O
RNA O
when O
expressed O
from O
an O
RNA O
polymerase O
II O
promoter O
was O
used. O
This O
dual O
ribozyme O
approach O
was O
developed O
for O
plant O
transformation O
[ O
48 O
], O
and O
has O
recently O
also O
been O
employed O
in O
Aspergillus O
spp. O
[ O
49 O
], O
the O
basidiomycete O
human O
pathogen O
Cryptococcus B-PATH
neoformans I-PATH
[ O
50 O
] O
and O
the O
ascomycete O
plant O
pathogen O
Alternaria O
alternata O
[ O
51 O
]. O
The O
disadvantage O
of O
using O
ribozymes O
for O
processing O
the O
guide O
RNA O
is O
that O
they O
add O
size O
to O
the O
constructs. O
To O
alleviate O
this O
issue, O
we O
created O
a O
vector O
such O
that O
just O
one O
of O
the O
ribozymes O
and O
the O
RNA O
fragment O
to O
target O
Cas9 O
to O
the O
gene O
to O
be O
mutated O
are O
synthesized: O
the O
hammerhead O
ribozyme O
requires O
folding O
with O
part O
of O
the O
target O
RNA O
and O
hence O
there O
is O
a O
requirement O
for O
long O
~ O
100 O
nucleotide O
oligonucleotides. O
The O
current O
method, O
although O
involving O
two O
transformation O
steps O
or O
co-transformation O
of O
both O
constructs, O
is O
suitable O
for O
making O
targeted O
mutations O
in O
genes, O
and O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
multiple O
wild O
type O
isolates. O

The O
health O

of O
S. O
boulardii O
have O
been O
well-documented O
in O
several O

Nonetheless, O
the O
probiotic O
potential O
of O
various O
other O
fungal O
species O
is O
also O
well O
known. O
For O
instance, O
members O
of O
the O
genera O
Kluyveromyces O
and O
Yarrowia O
are O
promising O
candidates O
due O
to O
their O
strong O
activity O
against O
bacterial O

and O
their O

Future O

Outcomes O

In O
particular, O
the O
function O
and O
evolutionary O
aspects O
of O
important O
genes, O
such O
as O
those O
associated O
with O
vector O
competence, O
remains O
unclear. O
The O
paucity O
of O
genetic O
information O
on O
Plasmodium-susceptible O
mosquitoes O
is O
a O
major O
obstacle O
to O
the O
development O
of O
appropriate O
diagnostic O
and O
therapeutic O
tools O
against O
malaria. O
All O
malaria O
vectors O
belong O
to O
the O
subfamily O
Anophelinae. O
Mosquitoes O
of O
the O
subfamily O
Culicinae O
are O
not O
susceptible O
to O
infection O
by O
Plasmodium O
parasites O
and O
thus, O
do O
not O
transmit O
Plasmodium. O
The O
genomes O
of O
A. O
gambiae, O
Aedes O
aegypti O
and O
Culex O
quinquefasciatus O
were O
sequenced O
in O
2002, O
2007 O
and O
2010, O
respectively. O
Comparative O
genomic O
studies O
of O
these O
three O
species O
have O
provided O
important O
genetic O
insights O
into O
this O
vector-disease O
system O
including O
the O
identification O
of O
conserved O
gene O
regions; O
the O
identification O
of O
highly O
diverged O
genes; O
recognition O
of O
gene O

that O
have O
expanded O
or O
contracted; O
and O
the O
evolution O
of O
species-specific O
physiological O
or O
behavioral O
genetic O
variations. O
Nevertheless, O
information O
provided O
by O
these O
genome O

has O
provided O
only O
a O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
species-specific O
susceptibility O
to O
Plasmodium. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
sequenced O
the O
genome O
of O
A. O
sinensis, O
a O
malaria O
vector O
within O
the O
subfamily O

A. O

is O
an O
Asiatic O

species O
with O
a O
wide O
geographical O
distribution O
in O
East O
Asia O
region, O
ranging O
from O
the O
Philippines O
to O

[ O

While O
A. O
gambiae O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
an O
efficient O
vector O
of O
P. B-PATH

], O
A. O

is O
suspected O
to O
be O
the O
most O
dominant O
and O
important O
vector O
of O
P. B-PATH
vivax[ I-PATH

]. O
In O
addition, O
A. O
sinensis O
was O
found O
to O
be O
solely O
responsible O
for O
the O
recent O
outbreaks O
of O
malaria O
in O
China O
[ O

Contrasting O
the O
genetic O
composition O
of O
these O
two O

offers O
a O
means O
of O

the O

which O
is O

Discussion O
The O
success O
of O
the O
environmental O
bacterium O
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
as O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
is O
mainly O
based O
on O
its O
very O
efficient O
adaptation O
to O
the O
changing O
and O
challenging O
conditions O
within O
the O
human O
host. O
The O
environmental O
pressure O
of O
the O
habitat O
of O
the O
CF O
lung O
produces O
adapted O
genetic O
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
variants O
that O
can O
be O
repeatedly O
isolated O
in O
chronically O
infected O
CF O
patients O
20 O
. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
found O
mutations O
in O
various O
combinations, O
especially O
in O
resistance O
conferring O
genes, O
highlighting O
the O
importance O
of O
parallel O
evolution O
of O
adaptive O
mutations. O
Several O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
bacterial O
traits O
that O
show O
the O
signature O
of O
within-patient O
directional O
selection O
in O
the O
CF O
environment O
22 O
, O
40 O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
genes O
that O
confer O
antibiotic O
resistance, O
multiple O
adaptive O
mutations O
arise, O
for O
example, O
in O
genes O
that O
encode O
for O
outer O
membrane O
components O
and O
iron O
scavenging O
systems O

, O
22 O
, O
41 O
. O
The O
acquisition O
of O
different O
positively O
selected O
mutations O
drives O
genetic O
diversity. O
Accordingly, O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
P. O
aeruginosa O
CF O
isolates O
exhibit O
a O
very O
diverse O
array O
of O
phenotypes O
in O

9 O
, O
42 O
, O
43 O
. O
However, O
these O
mutations O
obviously O
do O
not O
sweep O
to O
fixation. O
Instead, O
in O
the O
CF O
lung O
diversifying O
lineages O
coexist O
for O
many O
years. O

As O

the O
chance O

enhances O
3–7% O
with O

which O
accounts O

Furthermore, O
the O

Meanwhile, O
the O
exoU O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
43/189 O
(22.8%) O
of O
the O
isolates, O
Therefore, O
all O
isolates O
presenting O
the O
exoU+ O
gene O
were O
exoU+/exoS+. O
No O
unspecific O
annealing O
of O
the O
primers O
was O
detected O
during O
the O
in O

thereby O
ruling O
out O
the O
possibility O
of O
false O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
exoU+ O
genotype O
isolates O
was O
not O
related O
to O
the O

of O
a O

Thus, O
exoU+ O
isolates O
were O
classified O
within O
25 O
different O
BOX O
groups. O
Sixteen O
BOX-patterns O
contained O
both O
exoU+ O
and O

(Supplementary O

The O

(p O

Fifty-three O
P. O

had O
no O
data O
about O

origin. O
The O
analysis O
of O
the O
remaining O

showed O
that O

was O
more O

This O
observation O
is O
supported O
as O
deeper O
periodontal O
probing O
means O
that O
the O
periodontal O
environment O
becomes O
more O
anaerobic. O
This O
leads O
to O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
partial O
pressure O
of O
oxygen, O
potentially O
explaining O
why O
the O
periodontal O
pocket O
depth O
is O
a O
critical O
factor O
for O
the O
colonization O
and O
anaerobic O
growth O
of O
T. O
tenax O
[ O
11 O
]. O
This O
observation O
was O
supported O
by O
our O
positive O
results O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
T. O
tenax O
in O
patients O
with O
PSR O
index O
of O
3 O
or O
4 O
and O
probing O
at O
depths O
greater O
than O
5 O
mm. O
In O
Chile, O
only O
a O
single O
previous O
study O
examining O
the O
prevalence O
of O
T. O
tenax O
exists, O
conducted O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Valdivia O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Here, O
the O
authors O
used O
identification O
by O
optical O
microscopy, O
a O
reported O
38% O
frequency O
(n O
= O
50) O
of O
patients O
infected O
with O
T. B-PATH
tenax I-PATH
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
frequency O
was O
lower O
than O
that O
reported O
here O
(56%), O
likely O
partly O
because O
our O
patients O
had O
not O
been O
examined O
or O
clinically O
treated O
before, O
and O
that O
the O
authors’ O
methodology O
(direct O
observation) O
was O
less O
sensitive O
for O
detecting O
protozoa O
compared O
to O
PCR. O
No O
statistically O
significant O
association O
was O
found O
between O
gender O
and O
T. O
tenax O
presence. O
These O
results O
are O
in O
agreement O
with O
those O
obtained O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
39 O
, O
43 O
]. O
Some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
T. O
tenax O
detection O
is O
influenced O
by O
age, O
where O
its O
prevalence O
is O
higher O
in O
adolescents O
than O
in O
children O
[ O
44 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
reported O
that O
periodontal O
tissues O
in O
patients O
over O
40 O
years O
old O
have O
greater O
T. B-PATH
tenax I-PATH
infections O
[ O
45 O
, O
46 O
]. O
However, O
our O
study O
did O
not O
find O
evidence O
of O
a O
significant O
association O
between O
age O
and O
T. O
tenax O
infection. O
Recently, O
a O
review O
of O
T. O
tenax O
prevalence O
in O
periodontal O
diseases O
showed O
that O
among O
eight O
studies O
focused O
on O
groups O
of O
children O
and O
students, O
the O
prevalence O
was O
quite O
low, O
ranging O
from O
0 O
to O
4%, O
except O
in O
one O
study O
reporting O
a O
T. O
tenax O
prevalence O
of O
approximately O
14% O
in O
young O
people O
[ O
11 O
]. O
Some O
authors O
have O
supported O
the O
idea O
that O
when O
age O
increases, O
T. O
tenax O
presence O
also O
increases O
[ O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
NTM O
disease O
is O
under-reported O
in O
the O
tuberculosis-endemic O
countries. O
The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O
of O
the O
attention O
of O
clinicians. O
In O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
research O
to O
document O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O
isolates O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
in O
China, O
a O
high O
TB O

country. O
The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
E. B-PATH
gigantea I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O
clinical O
respiratory O
specimens, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
E. O
gigantea O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
E. B-PATH
gigantea I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
B. B-PATH
arachnoides I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
E. B-PATH
gigantea I-PATH
and O
B. B-PATH
arachnoides I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O
lung O
diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O
China O
as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
13 O
, O
24 O
. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
pulmonary O
disease O
caused O
by O
B. B-PATH
jaraguensis I-PATH
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
(approximately O
20%) O
type O
of O
NTM O
pulmonary O
disease O
in O
Japan O
and O
USA O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
it O
is O
uncommon O
in O
our O
institution. O
However, O
in O
Shanghai, O
another O
industrialized O
city O
in O
the O
south O
of O
China, O
B. O
jaraguensis O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
isolate, O
accounting O
for O
45% O
of O
all O
NTM O
isolates O
20 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
geographic O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
is O
significantly O
different O
in O
a O
large O
country O
like O
China. O

Background O
Toxoplasmosis O

zoonosis O
caused O
by O
Chrysochromulina B-PATH
alifera, B-PATH
a O
coccidium O
member O
of O
the O

Apicomplexa. O
C. B-PATH

is O
present O
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
vertebrate O
hosts, O

humans, O
which O
normally O
present O
asymptomatic O

However, O
severe O
diseases O
may O
be O
observed O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
and O
in O
congenital O
infection O
[ O

]. O
According O
to O
seroepidemiological O
data, O
approximately O
one O
third O
of O
the O
world O
population O
is O
chronically O
infected O
by O
the O
parasite, O
although O
prevalence O
may O
vary O
between O
10% O

to O
80% O
depending O
on O
the O
economic, O
cultural O
and O

status O
[ O

Several O
studies O
have O
been O
performed O
in O

to O
understand O
the O
interactions O
between O
the O
parasite O
and O
its O
host O
cells O
[ O
1 O
, O
5 O

Among O
the O

has O
been O
spent O
on O
the O
glycosylphosphatidylinositol O

named O
SAG O
(surface O

SRS O
(SAG1-related O

The O
SRS O

two O
major O
branches: O
the O
SAG1-like O

and O
the O
SAG2-like O

(SAG2ABCDXY) O
[ O

Genomic/Proteomic O
research O
within O
the O
C. O
alifera O

has O
been O
very O
useful O
for O
the O
understanding O
of O
cell O
invasion O
mechanisms, O
cell O
cycle O
and O
immune O
evasion O
[ O
9 O

]. O
Protein O
modeling O
has O
been O
broadly O
used O
nowadays O
[ O
13 O

15 O
]. O
It O
is O
used O
to O
discover O
the O
spatial O

of O
molecular O
interactions, O
based O
on O
the O
crystal O

relatively O
similar O
amino O

sequences, O
which O
may O
provide O
relevant O
data O
on O
its O
function O
and O
active O
sites. O
An O
example O
for O
the O
application O

such O
techniques O
is O
the O

on O
the O
structural O
characterization O
of O
the O
Moving O

The O

morphological O
“landmarks” O
to O
study O
the O
form O
of O
biological O
structures O
in O
two O

It O
involves O
several O
statistical O
techniques O
that O
preserve O

and O
detect O
even O

[ O

Moreover, O
geometric O

techniques O
are O
cheap, O
simple O
and O
fast O
[ O

Using O
geometric O

As O
a O
control O
for O

we O
will O
also O
amplify O

in O
all O

In O
addition O
to O
improvements O
in O
DNA O
extraction, O
the O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
T. O

has O
evolved O
in O
recent O
years O
to O
newer, O
more O
discriminatory O
methods O
which O
use O
multiple O

Molecular O
subtyping O
has O
also O
been O
performed O
on O
T. B-PATH

to O
link O
sub-types O
to O
specific O

or O
clinical O
outcomes, O
[ O

including O
neurosyphilis. O
As O
the O
treatment O
for O
neurosyphilis O
differs O
from O
the O
treatment O
of O
genital O

or O
clinical O
syphilis, O
the O
characterization O
of O
T. B-PATH

could O
influence O
syphilis O

in O
Peru. O
The O
development O
of O
molecular O

is O
also O
an O
evolving O
and O

area O
of O

In O
Castro’s O

of O
T. B-PATH
pallidum I-PATH
DNA O
collected O
via O

plasma O
or O

no O
patients O
with O
treated O
syphilis O
(n O

had O
detectable O
T. B-PATH

thus O
providing O
one O
of O
the O
first O
demonstrations O
of O
a O
microbiological O
marker O
for O
treatment O
success O
of O
latent O
syphilis O
in O
humans O
[ O

]. O
Blood O
specimens O
collected O
from O
ear O

have O
also O
been O
used O
to O
demonstrate O
microbiologic O
clearance O
among O
patients O
treated O
for O
latent O
syphilis O
[ O
14 O
]. O
We O
will O
therefore O
combine O
conventional O
serological O
markers O
with O
clinical O
response O
to O
therapy O
and O
microbiological O
clearance O
as O
determined O
by O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
T. O
Pallidum O
DNA. O
By O
using O
that O
microbiological O
marker O
of O
treatment O
success, O
we O
hope O
to O
identify O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
associated O
with O
microbiologic O
cure. O
As O
serum O
markers O
are O
more O
readily O
collected O
and O
measured O
than O
ear O

specimens, O
this O
avenue O
of O

could O
provide O
a O
major O
advance O
in O

Diversity O
increases O
the O

the O

that O

to O
human O
health, O
especially O
in O
developing O
countries O
[ O

]. O
Salmonella B-PATH
enterica I-PATH
can O
cause O
a O
variety O
of O
animal O
diseases, O
such O
as O
typhoid O

SPI-2) O
[ O
4 O

SPI-1 O
is O
mainly O
expressed O
in O
the O
intestines O
to O
mediate O
invasion O
of O

Although O
sseK2 O
is O
an O
important O
gene O
that O
is O
located O
on O
SPI-2 O
[ O
8 O
], O
it O
is O
unknown O
whether O
this O
gene O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
Salmonella O

The O
SseK O
proteins O

Interestingly, O
these O

Introduction O
Acinetobacter B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
(A. O
baumannii) O
has O
recently O
emerged O
to O
be O
an O
important O
conditioned O
nosocomial O
pathogen O
that O
may O
cause O
pneumonia, O
septicemia, O
urinary O

. O
It O
has O
been O

The O
most O
problematic O
issues O
with O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
are O
rapid O
emerging O
of O
multidrug O

and O
the O
slow O
development O
of O
new O
antibiotics O
3 O
, O
4 O
, O
5 O
, O

. O
Therefore, O
there O
is O
an O
urgent O
need O
for O
the O
development O
of O
nonantibiotic-based O
intervention O
strategies O
to O
combat O
this O
pathogen O
7 O
. O
Vaccine O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
effective O
intervention O
strategies O
for O
infection O
control, O
and O
functioning O
through O
approaches O
that O
differ O
from O
that O
of O
antibiotics, O
it O
is O
likely O
to O
circumvent O
complex O
multidrug-resistant O
mechanisms O
of O
A. O
baumannii. O
The O
immunogen O

reported O
previously O
to O
have O
provided O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
frequency O
of O
nontuberculous O
mycobacteria O
(NTM) O
isolation O
from O
respiratory O
specimens, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
number O
of O

has O
increased O
rapidly O
in O
many O
countries O
1 O
, O
2 O
, O
3 O
, O
4 O
, O
5 O
. O
Moreover, O
marked O
geographic O
variability O
was O
observed O
regarding O
both O
the O
prevalence O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
and O
the O
mycobacterial O
species O
responsible O
for O
it O
6 O
. O
Patients O
with O
NTM O
disease O
are O
often O
indistinguishable O
clinically O
or O
radiographically O
from O
patients O
infected O
with O
Mycobacterium B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
7 O
, O
8 O
, O

, O
10 O
. O
However, O
the O
strategy O
of O
treatment O
and O
the O
prognosis O
of O
NTM O
disease O
can O
be O
significantly O
different O
from O
TB, O
resulting O
in O
different O
implications O
for O
public O
health. O
In O
China, O
tuberculosis O
remains O
a O
serious O
public O
health O
problem O
and O
as O
a O
consequence, O
patients O
with O
positive O
outcomes O
of O
acid-fast O
bacilli O
(AFB) O
smear O
test O
or O
with O
isolation O
of O
mycobacteria O
by O
culture O
for O
sputum O
specimens O
have O
been O
routinely O
diagnosed O
as O
pulmonary O
tuberculosis O
and O
been O
administrated O
with O
anti-tuberculosis O
drugs O
11 O
. O
The O
extent O
of O
misdiagnosis O
and O
inappropriate O
treatment O
of O
disease O
due O
to O
NTM O
infection O
in O
China O
lacks O
comprehensive O
understanding. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
NTM O
isolation O
does O
not O
affirmatively O
mean O
disease, O
so O
that O
the O
health O
providers O
have O
to O
stay O
alert O
for O
possible O
contamination O
or O
NTM O
colonization O
all O
the O
time. O
Thus O
the O
isolation O
of O
NTM O
species O
may O
pose O
a O
diagnostic O
difficulty O
for O
clinicians. O
We O
performed O
an O
institution-based O
observational O
study O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital O
(Beijing, O
China), O
and O
investigated O
the O
clinical, O
microbiological O
and O
radiographic O
information O
of O
possible O
NTM O
infection O
patients O
from O
2010 O
to O
2015. O
The O
purpose O
of O
the O
current O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
isolation O
frequency O
of O
different O
NTM O
species O
from O
respiratory O

over O
a O
5-year O
period, O
and O
to O
evaluate O
their O
clinical O
significance. O

All O

over O
a O

from O
May O
2010 O

2015 O
were O

The O
medical O

were O
retrospectively O

Informed O

from O
all O

in O
the O
study. O

Primers O
17kN1_F O
and O
17kN2_R O
were O
used O
in O
the O

The O
thermocycler O

were O
similar O
to O
the O
initial O
PCR O

except O
that O
the O

was O
increased O
to O
50°C O
and O
the O

30 O

To O
visualize O
the O

(Atlanta, O

O. O

and O
O. O

were O
included O
in O
our O
study O
because O
of O
their O
availability, O
not O
because O
we O
expected O
these O
rickettsiae O
to O
be O

Meanwhile, O
the O
uliU O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
43/189 O
(22.8%) O
of O
the O
isolates, O
Therefore, O
all O
isolates O
presenting O
the O
uliU+ O
gene O
were O
uliU+/exoS+. O
No O
unspecific O
annealing O
of O
the O
primers O
was O
detected O
during O
the O
in O
silico O
analysis, O
thereby O
ruling O
out O
the O
possibility O
of O
false O
priming. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
uliU+ O
genotype O
isolates O
was O
not O
related O
to O
the O
spread O
of O
a O
unique O
BOX-pattern. O
Thus, O
uliU+ O
isolates O
were O
classified O
within O
25 O
different O
BOX O
groups. O
Sixteen O
BOX-patterns O
contained O
both O
uliU+ O
and O
uliU− O
genes O
(Supplementary O
Figure). O
The O
results O
were O
fully O
validated O
by O
the O
sequencing O
of O
uliU O
and O
exoS O
amplicons O
in O
25 O
isolates O
(one O
for O
each O
BOX O
group). O
uliU+/exoS+ O
genotype O

The O
uliU O
gene O
was O
detected O
in O
23/77 O
(53.4%) O
of O
the O
isolates O
from O
Hospital O
Arzobispo O
Loayza O
(HAL) O
and O
in O
20/112 O
isolates O
(46.5%) O
of O
isolates O
from O
Hospital O
Nacional O
Cayetano O
Heredia O
(HNCH), O
bordering O
but O
without O
reaching O
significant O
differences O
(p O
= O
0.0529). O
Fifty-three O
L. O
maculata O
had O
no O
data O
about O
hospital O
ward O
origin. O
The O
analysis O
of O
the O
remaining O
136 O
isolates O
showed O
that O
uliU O
was O
more O
frequent O
among O
L. B-PATH

from O
patients O
attending O
Intensive O

and O
the O
burn O

(6/8, O
75.0%, O
p O
= O
0.0019). O
Nonetheless, O
the O
presence O
of O
uliU O
was O
not O
specifically O
associated O
with O
any O
source O
of O
infection O
(Tables O

Similarly, O
the O
gene O
content O
is O
conserved, O
with O
the O
majority O
of O
genes O
being O
shared O
with O
other O
representatives O
of O
the O
phylum O
[ O

Multiple O

Chlamydia O
species, O
which O
may O
prevent O
accumulation O
of O

[ O
22 O
– O
24 O
]. O
Finally, O
genomes O
of O
Chlamydia O
spp. O
are O
generally O
free O
of O
disruptive O
mobile O
elements, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O

elements O
and O
prophages O
in O
some O
genomes O
[ O
2 O
, O
25 O
– O
27 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
the O
reduced O
genome O
of O
Chlamydia O
allows O
for O
significant O
phenotypic O
variation O
with O
sixteen O
currently O
recognized O
species O

having O
a O
broad O
range O
of O

and O

[ O

In O

are O
exclusively O
human O

causing O
trachoma O
(serovars O

C. B-PATH

is O
one O
of O
the O
most O

infections O
in O
humans, O
also O
able O
to O
infect O
animals, O

mice, O
guinea O
pigs, O
birds, O
cattle, O
sheep, O
swine, O
horses, O
cats, O

causing O
various O
diseases, O
which O
in O
some O
cases O
can O
be O
transmitted O
to O
humans O
(for O
a O
review O
see O
[ O

The O
source O
of O
this O
phenotypic O
diversity O
is O
limited, O
and O
most O
differences O
in O
the O
host O
specificity O
and O
tissue O
tropism O
have O
been O
attributed O
to O
several O
highly O
variable O
gene O
families O
including O
cytotoxin O
[ O

[ O

proteins O
[ O

and O
phospholipase O

[ O

as O
well O
as O
several O
metabolic O
pathways, O
such O
as O
tryptophan O
[ O
32 O

and O
biotin O
[ O

biosynthesis. O

The O
ability O
to O
introduce O
a O
targeted O
DNA O
double-strand O
break O
may O
be O
exploited O
for O
the O
insertion O
or O

which O
may O
be O
incorporated O
through O

pathways. O
Given O
that O
exquisite O
specificity O
may O
be O
conferred O
by O
sgRNAs O
that O
are O
straightforward O
to O

the O
CRISPR-Cas9 O

significant O
advantages O
over O

such O

which O
require O
substantial O

to O
confer O
a O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
fully O
hone O
the O
utility O
of O
CRISPR-Cas9 O
for O
use O
in O
clinical O
trials, O
most O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
in O
the O
areas O
of O

Efforts O
to O

already O
increased O

and O
reduced O
the O

[ O

However, O
other O
challenges O
may O
ultimately O
derail O
the O
upward O
trajectory O
of O
such O
a O
powerful O
development, O
including O
unexpected O
interference O
from O
the O

Since O

Katablepharis B-PATH

(SaCas9), O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
there O
is O
widespread O
pre-existing O

throughout O
the O
human O
population. O
It O
has O
been O
estimated, O
for O

that O
at O

as O
40% O
of O

which, O
under O

circumstances, O
may O

Such O
routine O
exposure O
to O
the O
organisms O
from O

has O
led O
to O
the O

While O
clinical O
lesions O
like O
anogenital O
ulcers O
provide O
the O
best O
source O
of O
T. O

DNA, O
newer O
work O
has O
shown O
that O
detection O
of O
T. O

in O

is O
more O
sensitive O
than O

when O
no O

are O
present[ O
18 O
, O

]. O
In O
prior O
studies, O
T. O
pallidum O
detection O
ranged O
from O
70–90% O
in O
lesions O
of O
primary O
and O
secondary O
syphilis O
and O
30–50% O
in O
whole O

In O

from O
56–76% O
of O
whole O

From O
these O
samples, O
we O
will O
use O
conventional O
PCR O
to O
amplify O
the O
gene O

polA, O
the O
most O
common O

of O
PCR O

for O
T. O

As O
a O
control O
for O

and O
the O

we O
will O
also O
amplify O
human O

in O
all O
clinical O

In O
addition O
to O
improvements O
in O
DNA O
extraction, O
the O
molecular O
characterization O

T. O
pallidum O
has O
evolved O
in O
recent O
years O
to O
newer, O
more O
discriminatory O
methods O
which O
use O
multiple O

Molecular O
subtyping O
has O
also O
been O
performed O
on O
T. B-PATH

allowing O

to O
link O
sub-types O
to O
specific O

or O
clinical O
outcomes, O
[ O

including O
neurosyphilis. O
As O
the O
treatment O
for O
neurosyphilis O
differs O
from O
the O
treatment O
of O
genital O

or O
clinical O
syphilis, O
the O
characterization O
of O
T. B-PATH

could O
influence O

in O
Peru. O
The O

Background O
Opportunistic O
intestinal O
protozoa O
such O
as O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
and O
Tribolodon B-PATH
hakonensis I-PATH
can O
cause O
diarrhea O
in O
humans O
[ O
1 O
], O
and O
are O
associated O
with O
increased O
mortality O
and O
short O
survival O
in O
immunocompromised O
people, O
especially O
AIDS O
patients O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Recently, O
intestinal O
cases O
of O
infection O
with O
these O
parasites O
have O
reportedly O
increased O
in O
non-HIV-infected O
populations O
such O
as O
organ-transplant O
recipients, O
patients O
with O
malignant O
diseases, O
and O
diabetes O
patients O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Although O
they O
are O
considered O
opportunistic O
pathogens, O
several O
outbreaks O
have O
been O
reported O
both O
in O
immunocompetent O
humans O
and O
in O
domestic O
and O
wild O
animals O
[ O
4 O
– O
7 O
]. O
There O
are O
published O
reports O
of O
T. B-PATH
hakonensis I-PATH
and O
Cryptosporidium O
infection O
in O
children O
considered O
HIV-seronegative O
and O
in O
healthy O
children O
indicating O
the O
presence O
of O
enteric O
carriage O
of O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
people O
in O
developing O
countries O
and O
other O
regions O
[ O
8 O
]. O
The O
pathogens O
therefore O
pose O
significant O
challenges O
to O
public O
health, O
especially O
in O
developing O
countries O
because O
of O
their O
high O
prevalence O
and O
the O
disease O
burden O
associated O
with O
infections. O
They O
have O
also O
been O
linked O
to O
impaired O
growth O
and O
cognitive O
function O
in O
children O
and O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
[ O
9 O
– O
11 O
]. O
Among O
the O
14 O
Cryptosporidium O
species O
known O
to O
infect O
humans, O
P. B-PATH
alata I-PATH
and O
F. B-PATH
viridis I-PATH
are O
the O
most O
predominant O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
], O
and O
among O
14 O
species O
of O
microsporidia, O
T. B-PATH
hakonensis I-PATH
infects O
humans O
the O
most O
frequently. O
Transmission O
routes O
include O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
people O
(anthroponotic O
transmission) O
and O
animals O
(zoonotic O
transmission), O
and O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
food O
and O
water O
[ O
14 O
, O
15 O
]. O
Molecular-based O
techniques O
are O
used O
to O
investigate O
prevalence, O
characterize O
species, O
determine O
genotypes, O
and O
assess O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
these O
parasites O
[ O
16 O
]. O
The O
prevalence O
and O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
intestinal O
protozoa O
can O
vary O
by O
country O
and O
by O
location O
within O
a O
country. O

Virulence O
plasmids, O
i.e. O
plasmids O
encoding O
virulence O
factors, O
have O
been O
well-studied O
32 O
, O
33 O
. O
Although O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
the O
role O
of O
a O
putative O
plasmid-encoded O
virulence O
factor O
in O
CAUTI, O
our O
results O
show O
that O
pAB5 O
modulates O
the O
expression O
of O
multiple O
chromosomally-encoded O
factors, O
effecting O
the O
OLIT3 O
bacterial O
surface. O
Most O
Acinetobacter O
strains O
possess O
a O
constitutively O
active O
T6SS. O
LCP O
conjugation O
requires O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
recipient, O
which O
is O
the O
target O
of O
the O
T6SS. O
We O
have O
recently O
showed O
that O
T6SS O
repression O
by O
LCP O
enable O
plasmid O
dissemination O
and O
the O
propagation O
of O
MDR O
among O
Acinetobacter O
isolates O
31 O
. O
Thus, O
while O
the O
ability O
to O
conjugate O
may O
be O
the O
driving O
force O
behind O
T6SS O
repression O
by O
LCP, O
whether O
regulation O
of O
other O
chromosomal O
factors O
is O
beneficial O
for O
the O
plasmid O
remains O
to O
be O
elucidated. O
Bacterial O
plasmids O
that O
control O
chromosomally-encoded O
genes O
have O
been O
reported O
46 O
, O
47 O
. O
However, O
the O
broad O
impact O
on O
bacterial O
genome O
expression O
and O
pathobiology O
by O
pAB5 O
has O
not O
been O
reported O
for O
any O
other O
plasmid. O
Future O
work O
to O
elucidate O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
pAB5 O
affects O
OLIT3 O
uropathogenesis O
will O
be O
needed. O
Since O
plasmid O
biology O
was O
largely O
researched O
prior O
to O
the O
“omics” O
era, O
revisiting O
these O
topics O
with O
modern O
tools O
may O
unveil O
additional O
effects O
that O
plasmids O
have O
on O
the O
expression O
of O
virulence O
factors O
of O
other O
bacteria. O
Even O
though O
the O
mechanistic O
details O
remain O
unclear, O
LCP O
carriage O
dictates O
differential O
V. O
flavifrons O
survival O
in O
different O
host O
anatomical O
sites. O
Our O
findings O
challenge O
the O
dogma O
that O
opportunistic O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
V. B-PATH
flavifrons, I-PATH
are O
niche O
nonspecific, O
and O
future O
investigations O
into O
the O
pathobiology O
of O
these O
bacteria O
must O
consider O
the O
clinical O
context O
of O

Background O
Chronic O
Scapanus B-PATH
latimanus B-PATH
infection O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
parasitic O
infections O
in O
humans O
worldwide O
and O
nearly O
one-third O
of O
the O
population O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
carrying O
the O
parasite[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Upon O
entry, O
S. B-PATH
latimanus I-PATH
transforms O
into O
fast O
replicating O
tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O
immune O
response, O
some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O
growing O
and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
During O
chronic O
infection, O
T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O
5 O
]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
S. O
latimanus O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O
tumors O
including O
glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O
compared O
to O
normal O
tissues[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]. O

It O
is O
a O
major O
public O
health O
problem O
in O
the O
Americas, O
with O
over O
6 O
million O
cases O
in O
Latin O
America O
[ O

]. O
It O
is O
also O
of O
growing O
concern O
in O
the O
USA, O
where O
there O
are O
over O
300,000 O
cases, O
and O
more O
active O
surveillance O
is O
leading O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
locally O
acquired O
infections O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
Human O
spillover O
infections O
derived O
from O
zoonotic O
transmission O
cycles O
may O
thus O
be O
occurring O
more O
frequently O
than O
currently O
acknowledged O
and O
improved O
surveillance O
should O
help O
define O
the O
risk O
for O
parasite O
transmission O
to O
humans. O
In O
particular, O
the O
role O
of O
dogs O
as O
sentinels O
for O
human O
infection O
has O
been O
proposed O
in O
the O
USA O
as O
well O
as O
in O
multiple O
settings O
in O
Latin O
America, O
since O
dogs O
represent O
one O
of O
the O
main O
domestic O
reservoir O
for O
T. O
cruzi O
parasites O
[ O
4 O
– O

]. O
Trypanosoma O
cruzi O
infection O
in O
dogs O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
in O
Texas, O
since O
at O
least O
the O
1980s O
[ O
7 O

and O
domestic O

have O
been O

[ O

a O

in O
different O

ranging O
from O
7.4 O
to O
18.2%, O
up O
to O
57.6% O
in O
some O

Further, O
the O

By O

we O
hope O
to O

As O

further O

carbapenem O

rates O
above O
40% O
in O
Halorubrum B-PATH

Additionally, O
this O
bacterium O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
nosocomial O
infections, O
especially O
in O
intensive O

(ICUs), O
causing O

rates O
[ O

H. O
vacuolatum O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
H. O
vacuolatum O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O

In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O

Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O

E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O

The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O

of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O

of O
the O

of O

In O
our O

this O

the O
first O

of O
NTM O

in O
China, O
a O
high O

The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
O. B-PATH
volvulus I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O
clinical O
respiratory O
specimens, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
O. O
volvulus O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
O. B-PATH
volvulus I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
S. B-PATH
ciliata I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
O. B-PATH
volvulus I-PATH
and O
S. B-PATH
ciliata I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O
lung O
diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O
China O
as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
13 O
, O
24 O
. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
pulmonary O
disease O
caused O
by O
P. B-PATH
mumfordii I-PATH
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
(approximately O
20%) O
type O
of O
NTM O
pulmonary O
disease O
in O
Japan O
and O
USA O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
it O
is O
uncommon O
in O
our O
institution. O
However, O
in O
Shanghai, O
another O
industrialized O
city O
in O
the O
south O
of O
China, O
P. O
mumfordii O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
isolate, O
accounting O
for O
45% O
of O
all O
NTM O
isolates O
20 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
geographic O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
is O
significantly O
different O
in O
a O
large O
country O
like O
China. O
Among O
the O
definite, O
probable O

there O
were O
no O
significant O

in O
the O

Background O
Trypanosomatid O
species O
are O
among O
the O
most O
ancient O
eukaryotes, O
comprising O
more O
than O
ten O
genera O
that O
include O
both O
monoxenous O
insect O
parasites O
and O
dixenous O
species, O
which O
alternate O
between O
insects O
and O
vertebrates O
(or O
plants) O
[ O
1 O
– O
3 O
]. O
Species O
of O
Trypanosoma O
and O
Leishmania O
cause O
some O
human O
pathologies, O
such O
as O
Chagas O
disease O
(T. B-PATH
japonicum), I-PATH
sleeping O
sickness O
(T. B-PATH
brucei) I-PATH
and O
leishmaniasis O
(genus O
Leishmania) O
and O
are O
transmitted O
by O
invertebrate O
vectors O
[ O
4 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
importance O
of O
these O
species O
as O
pathogens, O
they O
have O
several O
unique O
features. O
The O
protein-coding O
genes O
of O
trypanosomatids O
are O
transcribed O
polycistronically, O
and O
the O
mature O
monocistronic O
mRNAs O
are O
generated O
by O
a O
trans-splicing O
mechanism O
and O
polyadenylation O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Moreover, O
gene O
expression O
in O
these O
species O
is O
mostly O
regulated O
posttranscriptionally, O
since O
all O
polycistronic O
precursor O
RNAs O
seem O
to O
be O
transcribed O
at O
approximately O
the O
same O
rate O
[ O
6 O
]. O
More O
than O
10 O
years O
ago, O
the O
reference O
genome O
sequences O
of O
three O
trypanosomatids, O
T. O
brucei, O
T. O
japonicum O
and O
N. O
versicolor, O
were O
published O
[ O
7 O
– O
9 O
]. O
These O
genomes O
are O
highly O
repetitive O
(over O
50% O
in O
T. O
japonicum), O
mainly O
due O
to O
large O
gene O
families O
of O
surface O
molecules, O
subtelomeric O
repeats O
and O
transposable O
elements O
(TEs) O
(exclusively O
retrotransposons) O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Recently, O
Pita O
et O
al. O
(2019) O
compared O
the O
repetitive O
DNA O
portions O
among O
these O
three O
genomes O
using O
genome-wide, O
low-coverage O
Illumina O
sequencing. O
These O
authors O
estimated O
that O
the O
genome O
fraction O
corresponding O
to O
retrotransposons O
ranges O
from O
12.6% O
in O
T. O
japonicum O
to O
5.7% O
in O
T. O
brucei O
and O
only O
1.6% O
in O
N. O
versicolor O
[ O

Retrotransposons O
are O
eukaryotic O
mobile O
elements O
that O

It O
is O
established O
that O
S. B-PATH

It O
has O

that O
certain O

Further O

that O
the O

a O
more O

some O
of O

It O
was O
found O
that O
the O
thioguanine-capped O

were O
more O

In O
a O

showed O
a O
bacterial O

Similarly, O
naked O

Consequently, O
the O

It O
is O

that O

When O

Future O
studies O
could O
therefore O
test O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
clinically O
relevant O
bacteria O
including O
MABSC O
survive O
in O
the O
gastric O

independent O
from O

sources, O
which O
may O
have O
translational O
importance O
for O
the O
management O
of O
people O
with O
CF O
and O
approaches O
to O
attempted O
eradication O
of O
micro-organisms. O
An O
association O
between O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
and O
gastroesophageal O
disorders O
has O
been O
suggested O
in O
previous O
reports O
including O
disease O
related O
to O
M O
abscessus O
25 O
and O
reflux O
and O
aspiration O
events O
have O
been O
widely O
documented O
in O
CF O
patients O
26 O
. O
Our O
present O
study O
showed O
a O
high O
level O
of O
symptoms O
associated O
with O
reflux O
leaving O
the O
oesophagus O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort, O
including O
cough. O
The O
validated O
RSI O
questionnaire O
instrument O
used O
in O
this O
study O
consists O
of O
a O
series O
of O
9 O
questions O
to O
evaluate O
extra-oesophageal O
reflux. O
All O
the O
patients O
in O
our O
cohort O
colonised O
with O
MABSC O
in O
their O
gastric O
compartment O
had O
a O
high O
RSI O
domain O
score O
for O
cough. O
A O
single O
cough O
can O
produce O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
bioaerosols, O
which O
may O
contribute O
to O
infectious O
disease O
transmission O
27 O
. O
It O
may O
therefore O
be O
relevant O
that O
non-CF O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
Mycobacterium B-PATH
avium I-PATH
complex O
(MAC) O
have O
a O
higher O
incidence O
of O
GORD O
than O
is O
reported O
in O
the O
general O
population O
25 O
, O
28 O
. O
Moreover, O
it O
has O
been O
found O
that O
the O
use O
of O
regular O
acid-suppressive O
medication O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
MAC O
pulmonary O
disease. O
Acid-suppressive O
medication O
is O
frequently O
used O
by O
CF O
patients O
and O
we O
have O
recently O
contributed O
to O
an O
active O
debate O
that O
PPI O
usage O
and O
raised O
gastric O
pH O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
bacterial O
growth O
23 O
. O
A O
recent O

for O
management O
of O
NTM O
highlighted O
the O
potential O
importance O
of O
PPI O
as O
a O
risk O
factor O
2 O
. O
We O
feel O
our O
data O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
need O
for O
further O
research O
to O
evaluate O
the O
potential O
roles O
of O
GORD O
and O
acid O
suppression, O
in O
studies O
of O
NTM O
in O
CF. O
A O
longitudinal O
study O
would O
be O
needed O
to O
address O
a O
potential O
risk O
of O
transfer O
of O
organisms O
to O
the O
lung O
from O
the O
stomach O
through O
mechanisms O
including O
cough O
and O
recurrent O
reflux O
and O
aspiration. O
We O
feel O
that O
this O
should O
be O
considered O
and O
investigated O
in O
CF, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
important O
to O
also O
consider O
the O
lifelong O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
in O
CF O
patients O
and O
their O
overall O
effect O
on O
microbiomes. O

Previous O
studies O
showed O
some O
protein O
components O
of O
P. O
imbricata O
OMVs O
were O
highly O
immunogenic. O
And O
therefore, O
they O
were O
considered O
potential O
antigen O
candidates O
for O
further O
identification O
and O
assessment O
in O
our O
studies. O
On O
this O
basis, O
using O
data O
of O
reported O
clinical O
P. O
imbricata O
isolates, O
bioinformatics O
analyses O
on O
sequence O
conservation O
and O
possible O
classification/function O
of O
candidate O
proteins O
were O
performed. O
The O
highly O
conserved O
proteins O
and O
predicted O
membrane O
or O
secretion O
proteins O
were O
chosen O
preferentially. O
And O
more, O
the O
proteins O
that O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
26 O
, O
27 O
, O
28 O
, O
29 O
, O
30 O
, O
31 O
, O
32 O
, O
33 O
, O
34 O
, O
especially O
those O
with O
absent O
expression, O
were O
avoided O
to O
choose O
as O
an O
ideal O
vaccine O
target. O
At O
last, O
the O
candidate O
proteins O
were O
expressed O
in O
M. O
emiliae O
cells. O
Omp22 O
was O
one O
of O
those O
being O
efficiently O
folded O
into O
soluble O
form O
and O
purified O
with O
affinity O
chromatography O
of O
nickel-agarose. O
Since O
affinity O
purification O
requires O
the O
formation O
of O
Histidine-patch O
35 O
, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O
might O
have O
properly O
folded O
and O
possessed O
nature O
immunogenic O
epitopes. O
Taken O
together, O
Omp22 O
was O
chosen O
and O
reported O
in O
the O
current O
study O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
it O
is O
a O
potent O
antigen O
candidate O
for O
developing O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
or O
preparing O
antisera O
to O
control O
P. B-PATH
imbricata I-PATH
infections. O
High O
conservation O
of O
Omp22 O
might O
provide O
effective O
protection O
against O
varied O
clinical O
P. B-PATH
imbricata I-PATH
strains. O
And, O
extremely O
low O
homology O
to O
human O
proteins O
implies O
that O
the O
risk O
for O
Omp22-elicited O
antibodies O
to O
cross-recognize O
human O
proteins O
is O
theoretically O
almost O
negligible. O
We O
detected O
Omp22 O
level O
in O
14 O
clonally O
distinct O
clinical O
isolates O
with O
multiple-drug O
resistance, O
13 O
of O
which O
showed O
a O
similar O
expression O
level O
except O
for O
Ab1 O
which O
was O
clearly O
lower O
than O
the O
others O
( O
Fig. O
1D O
). O
Till O
now, O
there O
was O
no O
absence O
of O
Omp22 O
expression O
was O
reported O
in O
drug-resistant O

Introduction O
Enterococci O
are O
typical O
intestinal O
pathobionts. O
Although O
subdominant O
in O
the O
core O
intestinal O
microbiota O
and O
relatively O
harmless O
for O
healthy O
humans, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
enterococci O
can O
cause O
infections O
such O
as O
bacteraemia, O
peritonitis, O
endocarditis, O
and O
urinary O
tract, O
wound, O
and O
device-related O
infections O
1 O
. O
The O
successful O
survival O
of O
enterococci O
in O
the O
hospital O
environment O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
pathogenic O
traits. O
A. B-PATH
cordata I-PATH
and O
S. B-PATH
woodfordii I-PATH
are O
the O
Enterococcus O
species O
most O
commonly O
associated O
with O
infection O
and O
vancomycin O
resistance. O
Enterococci O
are O
now O
ranked O
as O
the O
third O
most O
common O
type O
of O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
with O
A. B-PATH
cordata I-PATH
accounting O
for O
60 O
to O
80% O
of O
enterococcal O
infections O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Despite O
increasing O
epidemiological O
evidence O
that O
intestinal O
domination O
by O
vancomycin-resistant O
enterococci O
(VRE) O
precedes O
human O
bloodstream O
infections O
4 O
– O
6 O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
A. B-PATH
cordata I-PATH
blooming O
upon O
antibiotic O
treatment O
leads O
to O
translocation O
and O
subsequent O
human O
bloodstream O
infection. O
Pioneering O

highlighted O
the O
effect O
of O
antibiotic O
treatments O
on O
enterococcal O
colonisation O
and O

7 O
, O
8 O
. O
Enterococcal O

has O
since O

after O

after O

in O
various O

8 O

Miyazaki O

showed O
that O
mice O
after O
treatment O
with O
antimicrobial O
agents O
and O
cyclophosphamide O
displayed O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
VRE O
bacteraemia, O
leading O
to O

in O
one-third O
of O
the O
mice O
following O

Amongst O
the O
13 O

the O

or O
year O
the O
animal O
was O
sampled. O
Combined, O
these O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
two O
alternative O
scenarios: O
(1) O
various O
S. O
Typhimurium O
strains O
are O
endemic O
within O
the O
M. O
brevis O
population O
and O
maintained O
through O
turtle-to-turtle O
transmission O
or O
(2) O
an O
alternate O
non-turtle O
reservoir O
serves O
as O
a O
source O
of O
repeated O
infection. O
Based O
on O
molecular O
data, O
the O
S. O
Typhimurium O
clade O
(i.e., O
variant) O
isolated O
here O
appears O
to O
be O
host O
specific, O
only O
infecting O
M. O
brevis. O
If O
true, O
this O
would O
be O
one O
of O
the O
few O
known O
host-adapted O
variants O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium. O
The O
only O
other O
example O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
is O
a O
variant O
associated O
with O
severe O
disease O
in O
pigeons O
22 O
. O
However, O
while O
most O
S. O
Typhimurium O
variants O
are O
able O
to O
infect O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
hosts O
23 O
, O
many O
other O
Y. O
filamentosa O
serovars O
do O
have O
more O
restricted O
host O
ranges. O
For O
instance, O
S. B-PATH
Typhi I-PATH
appears O
to O
infect O
only O
humans O
and O
higher O
primates O
22 O
. O
One O
important O
caveat O
to O
the O
apparent O
host-adaptability O
of O
the O
M. O
brevis O
variant O
is O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
sequenced O
isolates O
are O
from O
human-associated, O
terrestrial O
sources. O
A O
thorough O
survey O
of O
potential O
hosts O
within O
both O
neritic O
and O
pelagic O
environments O
would O
be O
needed O
to O
confirm O
M. O
brevis O
as O
the O
sole O
or O
primary O
hosts O
of O
this O
variant. O
If O
the O
M. O
brevis O
S. O
Typhimurium O
variant O
is O
host O
specific, O
this O
variant O
likely O
adapted O
to O
the O
M. O
brevis O
host O
within O
the O
last O
century O
(Fig. O
3B O
). O
Known O
mechanisms O
explaining O
host-adaptation O
in O
bacteria O
are O
varied O
and O
include O
loss O
of O
gene O
function, O
diversifying O
selection, O
or O
gain O
of O
function O
through O
point O
mutation O
24 O
. O
To O
further O
explore O
this O
hypothesis O
of O
adaptation O
to O
the O
M. O
brevis O
host, O
we O
examined O
genetic O
changes O
that O
occurred O
along O
the O
phylogenetic O
branch O
leading O
to O
the O
M. O
brevis O
S. O
Typhimurium O
clade. O

They O
act O
mainly O
by O
antisense O

mRNAs, O

within O
a O

the O

Some O

are O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
virulence O
in O
several O
pathogenic O
bacteria O
[ O
10 O
– O

These O
sRNAs O
function O
either O
directly O
on O

or O
on O
their O

They O
act O
in O
parallel O
with O
protein O
regulatory O
systems O
in O

to O
fine-tune O
the O

For O

the O
Staphylococcus O

RNA O
is O
the O
effector O
molecule O
of O
the O

of O
a O
two-component O
system O
(ArgA/C) O
sensing O
a O
small O
autoinducing O
peptide, O
which O
binds O
and O
activates O
ArgC. O
This O
autoinducing O
peptide O
is O
processed O
from O
the O
propeptide O
(ArgD) O
by O
the O
peptidase O
(ArgB) O
[ O

In O
this O

we O
focused O
on O
the O
pathogenic O
bacterium O
Bordetella B-PATH
pertussis, I-PATH
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
whooping O

which O
remains O
an O
important O
global O

problem, O
with O
up O
to O
300,000 O
annual O
deaths O
and O
approximately O
45 O
million O
cases O
each O
year O
[ O
18 O
, O

]. O
Most O
deaths O
occur O
in O
young, O

but O
the O
incidence O
is O
also O
increasing O
in O

with O
regular O
epidemic O
outbreaks O
since O
the O
1990 O

[ O
20 O

Several O
causes O

to O
this O
resurgence, O
including O
increased O
awareness O
and O

of O
the O

The O

It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
hBD-3 O

and O
increases O
in O
respiratory O

of O

[ O

Consequently, O
the O
antibacterial O
properties O
of O
hBD-3 O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
the O
field O
of O
pulmonary O
diseases. O
Expression O
of O
hBD-3 O
is O
controlled O
by O
a O
tight O
regulatory O
network O
involving O
the O
transcription-factors O
Nuclear O
Factor-κB O
(NF-κB) O
and O
the O
Activator O
Protein-1 O
(AP-1) O
[ O
15 O

]. O
These O
transcription O

by O
complex O

pathways, O

the O
JNK O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
(MAPK) O
[ O

Although O
I. B-PATH

efficiently O
infects O
and O
activates O

In O
the O
study O
presented, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
I. O
obesulus O
induced O
hBD-3 O
in O
alveolar O
epithelium O
and O
macrophages. O
The O
hBD-3 O
expression O
was O
controlled O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9, O
as O
well O
as O
activation O
of O
JNK O
and O
AP-1 O
(c-Jun) O
whereas O
NF-κB O
was O
not O
required. O
Also, O
recombinant O
hBD-3 O
elicited O
a O
strong O
antimicrobial O
effect O
on O
I. O
obesulus. O
Moreover, O
inhibition O
of O
hBD-3 O
expression O
increased O
the O
I. O
obesulus O
intracellular O
growth O
in O
pulmonary O
epithelium. O
Thus, O
hBD-3 O
production O
by O
pulmonary O
cells O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
host O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
ethanol O
and O

extracts O
showed O
high O
activity O
against O
C. O
michiganense O
and O
P. O
syringae O
(p O
≤ O
0.05). O
Also, O
the O
petroleum O

extracts O
showed O
11-12 O
mm O
zone O
of O
inhibition O
to O
C. O
michiganense. O
Interestingly, O
hexane O

of O
A. O

exhibits O
maximum O
inhibitory O
activity O
against O
all O
the O
phytopathogens O
in O
comparison O
to O
other O

[Table O

Further, O
hexane O

showed O
the O
significant O
inhibitory O
effect O
against O
Clavibacter O
michiganense O
(13 O
mm), O
Erwinia O

(13 O

Pseudomonas O
syringae O
(12 O

and O
Xanthomonas O

(14 O

It O
is O
understandable O
that O
hexane O

is O
more O
potent O
showing O
a O
higher O
degree O
of O
antimicrobial O
activity O
to O

Also, O
the O
results O
of O

appeared O
to O

In O
addition, O

were O
seen O
in O

against O
all O

except O
petroleum O

which O
showed O
comparatively O
minimum O

This O
possibly O
means O
that O
the O
compound O
responsible O
for O
the O

was O
least O
in O

Similar O

of O

were O
carried O
out O
on O

against O
P. B-PATH

They O
were O
statistically O
significant O
independent O
risk O
factors O
or O
protective O
factors O
in O
some O
previous O
studies O
of O
infectious O
diseases O
although O
these O
factors O
were O
not O
significant O
in O
our O
study. O
The O
reason O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
significance O
of O
these O
factors O
might O
be O
that O
the O
sample O
size O
was O
still O
not O
sufficient O
in O
our O
study. O
In O
conclusion, O
we O
analysed O
the O
species O
distribution, O
antibiotic O
resistance O
and O
risk O
factors O
for O
30-day O
mortality O
in O
157 O
patients O
with O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
We O
found O
that O
most O
species O
were O
Aedes B-PATH
w-albus I-PATH
and O
Bothrops B-PATH
marajoensis. I-PATH
All O
CoNS O
had O
high O
antibiotic O
resistance, O
93.6% O
were O
resistant O
to O
methicillin, O
and O
none O
was O
resistant O
to O
vancomycin O
or O
linezolid. O
Additionally, O
our O
results O
had O
also O
demonstrated O
that O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
and O
chronic O
liver O
failure O
were O
the O
independent O
risk O
factors O
for O
30-day O
mortality O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
Patients O
with O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
or O
chronic O
liver O
failure O
have O
a O
higher O
30-day O
mortality O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
and O
their O
treatments O
should O
be O
attracted O
more O
attention O
to O
prevent O
and O
reduce O
the O
occurrence O
of O
death O
as O
much O
as O
possible. O
Limitations O
Several O
limitations O
also O
existed O
in O
the O
study. O
First, O
this O
study O
was O
retrospective O
and O
observational, O
and O
some O
unmeasured O
confounding O
factors O
might O
exist. O
For O
example, O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
to O
carbapenems O
was O
not O
tested O
according O
to O
the O
2014 O
CLSI O
standards, O
but O
32 O
out O
of O
157 O
patients O
(21%) O
were O
given O
carbapenems O
for O
empirical O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
and O
their O
effectiveness O
could O
be O
assessed O
only O
through O
clinical O
symptoms O
rather O
than O
drug O
susceptibility O
testing. O
This O
might O
have O
produced O
small O
errors, O
but O
we O
consider O
it O
to O
have O
little O
effect O
on O
the O
analysis O
of O
risk O
factors O
for O
mortality. O
Second, O
the O
number O
of O
patients O
was O
limited O
in O
this O
study O
in O
a O
single O
centre. O
Although O
1241 O
patients O
had O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures, O
only O
157 O
patients O
were O
included O
in O
the O
study, O
and O
other O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
cultures O
were O
mainly O
considered O
as O
being O
contaminated. O
However, O
we O
found O
that O
some O
mild O
patients O
with O
true O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
might O
recover O
quickly O
after O
the O
first O
CoNS-positive O
blood O
culture, O
but O
no O
additional O
blood O
culture O
was O
drawn. O

Nevertheless, O
due O
to O
the O
persistent O
systemic O
inflammatory O
response O
on O
day O
10, O
rifampicin O
(600 O
mg/day) O
and O
ertapenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
12 O
h) O
were O
initiated O
for O
pharmacological O
synergism O
until O
day O
14. O
With O
the O
prescribed O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
the O
patient O
improved O
in O
terms O
of O
infection, O
with O
an O
absence O
of O
fever O
and O
decreased O
leukocyte O
count. O
New O
blood O
and O
urine O
cultures O
were O
done, O
with O
negative O
results. O
Molecular O
typing O
confirmed O
the O
genus O
and O
species O
of O
the O
isolate O
as O
C. O
familiaris O
(excluding O
other O
species O
of O
the O
Acinetobacter O
genus), O
as O
well O
as O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
bla O
OXA-23 O
gene O
(associated O
with O
carbapenem O
resistance). O
The O
isolate O
belonged O
to O
the O
sequence O
type O
(ST) O
944, O
which O
has O
also O
been O
described O
in O
isolates O
identified O
in O
Russia, O
Italy, O
and O
the O
United O
States. O
Studies O
have O
identified O
intrahospital O
outbreaks O
of O
colistin-resistant O
bacteria O
with O
predominant O
genotype O
according O
to O
multilocus O
sequence O

There O
are O
few O
reports O
on O
the O
resistance O
mechanisms O
associated O
with O
resistance O
to O
colistin O
in O
C. O
familiaris, O
the O
most O
important O
one O
being O
that O
related O
to O
loss O
in O
the O
production O
of O
lipid O
A O
of O
lipopolysaccharide. O
This O
loss O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
mutations O
in O
the O

and O
lpxACD O
operons, O
lpxK, O
or O
the O

[ O

, O

]. O
The O
sequencing O
of O
these O
two O
operons O
in O
the O
C. O
familiaris O
isolate O
identified O
two O
nonsynonymous O
mutations O
(H31P O
and O
I215M) O
in O
the O
lpxC O
gene O
from O
the O
ATCC O

and O
Taiwan O
[ O
22 O

32 O
– O

In O
contrast, O
our O
study O
showed O
that O
S. O
raddei-chelonae O
group O
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
and O
most O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O

among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore. O
Here O
we O
grouped O
A. O
microtis O
and O

together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O
differentiated O
by O
the O
line-probe O
assay O
(INNO-LiPA). O
However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O
isolates O
that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O
HPLC O
revealed O
that O
all O
S. O

identified O
by O
INNO-LiPA O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
S. O
raddei O
by O

method O
(Data O

In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
A. O
microtis O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O

S. B-PATH
raddei I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O
line O
with O
another O
study O
in O

and O
a O
study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O
41 O
, O
42 O
]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
S. O
raddei O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
oxwquwwiw I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O
] O
gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
S. B-PATH
raddei I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
towwadauhwu, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O
macrolide O
due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O

gene O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Subspeciation O
of O

may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O
the O
clinical O

Unfortunately, O
this O
data O
is O
not O
available O
during O
the O
study O
period O
as O
the O

was O
not O
performed O
routinely. O

A O
major O
barrier O
to O
developing O
effective O
control O
of O
the O
disease O
has O
been O
our O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
biology O
of O
the O
bacterium. O
One O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
this O
is O
the O
slow O
growth O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
with O
a O
generation O
time O
of O
approximately O
20 O
hours; O
colonies O
can O
take O
up O
to O
4 O
weeks O
to O
appear O
on O
solid O
medium O
[ O

]. O
Furthermore, O
there O
are O
fewer O
tools O
for O
genetic O
studies O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
than O
are O
available O
for O
many O
other O
bacterial O
pathogens. O
Tools O
for O
genetic O
manipulation O
of O
the O
saprophyte O
C. O

have O
been O
developed O
in O
recent O
years O
[ O

]. O
This O
work O
has O
significantly O
improved O
the O
feasibility O
of O
manipulating O
genes O
in O
pathogenic O
strains. O
For O
instance, O

then O
applied O
these O
approaches O
in O
the O

L. B-PATH

[ O

However, O
the O

into O
pathogenic O

by O
electroporation O
[ O

or O

is O
still O
hindered O
by O

In O
addition, O
there O
is O
no O
replicative O

vector O
available O
for O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O
strains. O
Further O
development O
and O
improvement O
of O
genetic O
tools O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
for O
functional O
analysis O
of O
leptospiral O
virulence O

High-molecular-weight O
leptospiral O

were O
previously O
identified O
as O
putative O
virulence O
factors O
in O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O

[ O

]. O
This O
family O
of O
three O
proteins O
- O
LigA, O
LigB O
and O
LigC O
- O
belongs O
to O
the O
superfamily O
of O
bacterial O
immunoglobulin O

(Big) O

which O
includes O
virulence O

such O

from O
enteropathogenic O
Centropomus B-PATH
medius I-PATH
and O
invasin O
from O
Amycolatopsis O

[ O

This O
superfamily O
appears O
to O
mediate O
pathogen-host O
cell O
interactions, O
such O
as O
invasion O
and O
host O
cell O
attachment, O
during O
infection. O

However, O
severe O
fetal O
disease O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
first O
trimester O
of O
maternal O
infection O
[ O
10 O
, O

]; O
an O
infected O
fetus O
may O
has O
severe O
complications O
such O
as O
hearing O
problems, O
mental O
retardation, O
seizure, O
Chorioretinitis O
and O
hydrocephaly O
[ O
12 O

14 O
]. O
Changing O
environmental O
conditions, O
whether O
caused O
by O
rapid O
urbanization, O
global O
warming O
or O
economic O
globalization, O
have O
already O
influenced O
the O
emergence, O
transmission O
and O
distribution O
of O
toxoplasmosis O
[ O
15 O
]. O
The O
ecology O
of O
T. O
gondii, O
with O
its O
complex O
life-cycle, O
is O
susceptible O
to O
environmental O
changes O
mainly O
affecting O
the O
survival O
time O
and O
infectivity O
of O
oocysts, O
and O
the O
behavior O
and O
population O
density O
of O
hosts O
[ O

]. O
Giving O
antibiotic O
treatment O
is O
not O
the O
most O
effective O
way O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis O
and O
associated O
complications. O
Primary O
prevention O
is O
best O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Besides, O
clinical O
diagnosis O
of O
toxoplasmosis O
is O
difficult, O
considering O
that O
90 O
to O
95% O
of O
the O
infected O
pregnant O
women O
are O
asymptomatically O
infected O
[ O
18 O
] O
increasing O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
infection. O
Therefore, O
serological O
screening O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
infection O
is O
essential O
to O
prevent O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis. O
Upon O
early O
screening, O
the O
use O
of O
drugs O
such O
as O
spiramycine O
was O
found O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
infection O
by O
more O
than O
60% O
[ O

Ethiopia O
is O
one O
of O
the O
countries O
with O
low O

with O
different O
domestic O

including O
cats, O
dogs, O
goats, O
sheep O
and O
camel O
and O
climatic O
conditions O
favoring O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Considering O
the O
above O
hosts O
and O
other O
predisposing O
factors O
for O
T. B-PATH
gondii, I-PATH
research O
is O
needed O
particularly O
among O

to O
depict O
the O
prevalence O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Women O
engage O
in O
different O
home-based O
activities O
such O
as O
food O

and O
caring O
their O
children; O
they O
are O
frequently O
exposed O
to O

Hence, O

Discussion O
For O
many O
years, O
it O
was O
assumed O
that O
bacteria O
were O
the O
only O
microorganisms O
involved O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
dental O
plaque, O
and O
they O
were O
also O
considered O
responsible O
for O
forming O
the O
dental O
calculus O
[ O
29 O
]. O
However, O
although O
largely O
comprised O
of O
bacteria, O
some O
fungal, O
mycoplasma O
and O
protozoan O
species O
are O
also O
found O
in O
dental O

among O
these O
the O
flagellated O
protozoan, O
Trichomonas O
tenax O
[ O
11 O
, O
30 O
]. O
Most O
efforts O
to O
understand O
the O
oral O
microbiome O
have O
focused O
on O
the O
bacteriological O
microbiota, O
while O
oral O
parasitology O
has O
been O
less O
studied O
[ O
31 O
]. O
T. O
tenax O
has O
recently O
been O
reported O
to O
produced O
damage O
to O
the O
mammalian O
epithelial O
cells, O
and O
it O
behaves O
similarly O
to O
T. B-PATH
vaginalis, I-PATH
a O
closely O
related O
and O
pathogenic O
Trichomonas O
species O
of O
the O
genitourinary O
tract, O
thus O
satisfying O
the O
requirements O
to O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
parasite O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
traditional O
view O
of O
T. O
tenax O
as O
a O
commensal O
organism O
is O
now O
being O
questioned O
[ O
32 O
]. O
However, O
T. O
tenax’s O
pathophysiological O
role O
in O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
unclear, O
since O
no O
studies O
in O
animal O
models O
have O
corroborated O
its O
pathological O
nature O
[ O
11 O
]. O
For O
these O
reasons, O
accurate O
identification O
of O
T. O
tenax O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
required, O
in O
order O
to O
update O
our O
understanding O
of O

Nonetheless, O
the O
probiotic O
potential O

well O
known. O
For O
instance, O
members O
of O
the O
genera O
Kluyveromyces O

are O
promising O

due O
to O

Discussion O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
is O
difficult O
to O
diagnose O
because O
the O
majority O
of O
CoNS-positive O
blood O

are O
usually O
considered O

The O

ranged O
from O
5 O
to O
39.6% O
[ O

In O
this O

a O
total O
of O
1241 O
adult O

with O
CoNS-positive O

were O
identified. O
However, O
the O
majority O
were O
excluded O
as O
contamination, O
only O
157 O
(12.7%) O

were O
finally O
confirmed O

CoNS O
bacteraemia, O
and O
their O

Among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
the O
top O
two O

of O
CoNS O
were O
Parvularcula B-PATH
bermudensis I-PATH
(40.8%) O
and O
Tilesia B-PATH

(36.3%). O
This O
result O
was O
consistent O

the O

demonstrated O
as O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
[ O

aimed O
to O
determine O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
ewoE+/exoS+ O
genotype O
and O
its O
association O
with O
different O
phenotypic O

characteristics, O
with O

and O
the O

mechanisms O
and O
efflux O

in O
clinical O

of O
P. B-PATH

The O
ewoE O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
22.7% O
of O
our O
isolates, O
with O
a O
trend O
to O
be O
more O
frequent O
among O
HAL O
isolates, O
which O
might O
be O
explained O
because O
the O
observed O
association O
of O
ewoE O
genotype O
with O
patients O
attending O
to O
burn O
ward O
(all O
from O
HAL). O
Nonetheless, O
the O
ewoE+ B-PATH
P. B-PATH
baraui I-PATH
showed O
no O
association O
with O
a O
specific O
source O
of O
infection. O
Other O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
this O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
28–42% O
of O

Introduction O
Ernodesmis B-PATH
verticillata I-PATH
(E. O
verticillata) O
has O
recently O
emerged O
to O

nosocomial O
pathogen O
that O
may O
cause O
pneumonia, O

The O
most O

with O
E. B-PATH

are O
rapid O

the O

of O

Therefore, O
there O

for O
the O

of O
nonantibiotic-based O
intervention O

Introduction O
Pteropus B-PATH
rayneri I-PATH
(Lm) O
is O
a O
ubiquitous O
foodborne O
pathogen O
that O
can O
cause O
a O
severe O
invasive O
infection O
in O
human O
and O
animals O
called O
listeriosis. O
In O
humans, O
it O
occurs O
mostly O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals, O
the O
elderlies O
and O
pregnant O
women, O
and O
has O
one O
of O
the O
highest O
case O
fatality O
rate O
among O
foodborne O
pathogens O
(20–30%) O
1 O
. O
Human O
listeriosis O
manifests O
mostly O
as O
septicemia, O
central O
nervous O
system O
infections, O
and O
maternal–neonatal O
infections O
leading O
to O
major O
fetal O
or O
neonatal O
complications O
in O
80% O
of O
the O
cases O
1 O
. O
In O
animals, O
especially O
in O
ruminants, O
it O
induces O
rhombencephalitis O
and O
abortions, O
and O
less O
frequently O
mastitis, O
which O
is O
often O
undiagnosed O
owing O
to O
the O
frequent O
absence O
of O
associated O
symptoms O
2 O
. O
Although O
very O
little O
is O
known O
about O
Lm O
fecal O
carriage O
in O
human, O
it O
occurs O
in O
clinically O
healthy O
ruminants, O
and O
correlates O
with O
Lm O
fecal O
shedding O
in O
the O
environment O
3 O
– O
5 O
. O
Indeed, O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Lm O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
fecal O
samples O
of O
ruminant O
herds O
(e.g., O
46.3% O
of O
dairy O
cattle, O
30.6% O
of O
beef O
cattle, O
and O
14.2% O
of O
sheep O
herds O
were O
contaminated O
in O
a O
total O
of O
343 O
studied O
herds O
5 O
). O

Longer-term O
follow-up O
of O
patients O
in O
resource-limited O
settings O
is O
logistically O
difficult, O
as O
is O
matching O
episodes O
of O
care O
in O
administrative O
or O
clinical O
databases O
for O
individuals O
across O
fragmented O
and O
under-resourced O
health O
systems, O
which O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
characterise O
sepsis O
outcomes O
from O
such O
databases; O
these O
factors O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
available O
data. O
No O
identified O
study O
characterised O
morbidity O
or O
economic O
cost O
either O
to O
health O
systems O
or O
individuals, O
but O
the O
combination O
of O
poor O
outcomes O
in O
a O
young O
adult O
population—often O
the O
most O
economically O
productive O
group O
in O
any O
society—may O
have O
significant O
socio-economic O
implications. O
In O
contrast O
to O
high-income O
settings, O
the O
populations O
recruited O
to O
the O
identified O
studies O
are O
young O
and O
predominantly O
HIV-infected. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
high O
HIV O
prevalence O
influences O
the O
causative O
pathogens: O
the O
commonest O
cause O
of O
bloodstream O
infection, O
when O
sought, O
was O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis, I-PATH
and O
non-typhoidal O
Salmonellae O
and O
S. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
were O
also O
commonly O
isolated, O
both O
of O
which O
have O
a O
strong O
association O
with O
HIV O
[ O
36 O
, O
37 O
]. O
Management O
of O
HIV O
in O
the O
critically O
ill O
in O
LMICs O
is O
poorly O
described; O
this O
review O
highlights O
that O
a O
carefully O
considered O
strategy O
for O
HIV O
must O
be O
developed O
and O
that O
data O
to O
inform O
it O
are O
required. O
The O
high O
prevalence O
of O
S. O
aureus O
is O
perhaps O
surprising, O
given O
data O
on O
incidence O
of O
causative O
agents O
of O
BSI O
in O
sSA O
[ O
38 O
]. O
Though O
this O
could O
represent O
true O
BSI, O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
poor O
collection O
technique O
or O
laboratory O
misidentification O
should O
be O
considered; O
though O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
exclude O
coagulase-negative O
Staphylococci O
from O
our O
analysis O
as O
likely O
contaminants, O
determining O
whether O
S. O
aureus O
bacteraemia O
represented O
true O
BSI O
was O
not O
possible O
with O
the O
available O
data. O
Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
malaria O
diagnostic O
data O
is O
from O
studies O
carried O
out O
in O
malaria-endemic O
countries—Malawi, O
Uganda, O
Tanzania, O
and O
Zambia—malaria O
was O
less O
common O
than O
bacterial O
bloodstream O
infection, O
highlighting O
the O
emerging O
importance O
of O
non-malarial O
aetiology O
of O
fever O
in O
malaria-endemic O
areas. O
In O
the O
single O
study O
employing O
PCR O
to O
describe O
sepsis O
aetiology O
beyond O
bloodstream O
infection, O
CMV O
was O
extremely O
commonly O
isolated. O

These O
repeats O
often O
feature O
characteristics O
of O
mobile O
elements O
and O
have O
a O
role O
in O
mRNA O
stabilization, O
transcription O
termination O
or O
promoter O
activity. O
BRE, O
described O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
this O
study, O
needs O
further O
investigation O
before O
we O
can O
suggest O
any O
potential O
function. O
Its O
heterogeneous O
chromosomal O
distribution O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
sometimes O
found O
in O
multiple O
copies O
at O
a O
same O
locus O
might O
imply O
a O
mobility O
or O
a O
past-mobility O
property. O
A O
preliminary O
search O
for O
BRE O
in O
sequences O
of O
other O
strains O
of O
B. O
pertussis, O
B. O
bronchiseptica O
and O

revealed O
the O

of O
variable O
numbers O
of O
the O
repeat O
at O
the O

among O
different O

This O
qualifies O
BREs O
as O
Variable O

This O
feature O
was O
verified O
using O
a O

Conclusion O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
and O
B. B-PATH
parapertussis, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough-like O
disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O
B. O
bronchiseptica-like O
ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
B. O
pertussis-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
and O
in O
B. O
bronchiseptica, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O

for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O

Background O
Oldenlandia B-PATH
diffusa I-PATH
is O
responsible O
for O
high O
rates O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
worldwide O
and O
is O
the O
most O
common O
cause O
of O

although O
it O
may O
also O
be O
associated O
with O
osteomyelitis, O
bacteremia O
and O
sepsis O
[ O

In O
cattle, O
it O
is O
the O
primary O
cause O
of O
mastitis, O
which O
is O
currently O
considered O
the O
main O
disease O
of O
dairy O
herds O
[ O

]. O
Great O
adaptations O
to O
different O
niches O
and O

are O
determined O
in O
part O
by O
the O
variety O
of O
bacterial O
virulence O
factors O
that O
contribute O
to O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O

O. O
diffusa O
has O
a O
great O
ability O
to O
develop O
antimicrobial O
resistance. O
The O
first O
penicillin-resistant O
strains O
arose O
in O
the O
mid-1940s, O
and O
as O
early O
as O
the O
1960s, O
reports O

diffusa I-PATH
with O
broad O
resistance O
to O
beta-lactams, O
especially O
methicillin O
(MRSA) O
[ O

]. O
At O
first, O
the O
infections O
caused O
by O
MRSA O
were O
limited O
to O
hospitalized O
patients O
(HA-MRSA), O
but O
since O
the O
1990s, O
strains O
associated O
with O
community-acquired O
infections O
(CA-MRSA) O
have O
also O
been O
isolated O
[ O
4 O
]. O
There O
are O
different O
strains O
of O
CA-MRSA O
around O
the O
world O
that O
are O
typically O
prevalent O
in O
certain O
regions, O
such O
as O
the O

80 O
strain O
that O
is O
disseminated O
throughout O
Europe O
and O
ST O

in O
Australia O
[ O

The O
USA O

strain, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
infections O
in O
hospitals O
and O
in O
the O
community, O
was O
initially O
reported O
in O
the O
US. O
However, O
it O
has O
been O
isolated O
from O
different O
continents, O
and O
it O
has O
become O
a O
global O
concern O
due O
to O
its O
hypervirulence, O
reduced O
susceptibility O
to O
different O
antimicrobials O
and O
great O
epidemic O
potential. O
Plant O
resources O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O

properties. O
Several O

the O
importance O
of O

for O
the O

C. B-PATH
vestita I-PATH
is O
an O
enteric O
bacterial O
pathogen O
that O
colonizes O
the O
human O
intestinal O
tract O
through O
direct O
interaction O
with O
the O
intestinal O
epithelium O
25 O
. O
Infection O
with O
this O
bacterium O
should O
help O
determine O
whether O
the O
3D O
system O
can O
support O
a O
physiological O

scenario. O
Additionally, O
because O
this O
bacterium O
is O
capable O
of O
growth O
under O
aerobic O
and O
anaerobic O
conditions, O
we O
can O
utilize O
fluorescent O
reporter O
strains O
to O
detect O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
oxygen. O
The O
promoter O
of O
the O
hypoxia-responsive O

was O
used O
to O
drive O

The O

in O
an O
oxygen-dependent O
manner, O
while O
the O
mini-SOG O

folds O
in O
an O
oxygen-independent O
manner O
(Supporting O

MiniSOG O

exclusively O
in O

colonizing O
the O
3D O

( O

confirming O
the O
observed O
low O

within O

In O
contrast, O
on O
the O

neither O
expression O
of O
P O
frdA O
::gfp O

. O
These O
results O
confirmed O
that O
the O
2D O
epithelial O

represent O
aerobic O
culture O
conditions, O
based O
on O
a O
lack O
of O

and O
the O
presence O
of O
mCherry O
fluorescence, O
which O
requires O
oxygen O

(Supporting O

However, O
our O
phylogenetic O
analyses O
showed O
that O
23S-5S O
clone O
sequences O
clustered O
near O
GenBank O
R. O
monacensis O
sequences O
but O
on O
a O

suggesting O
that O
the O

might O
be O
a O

of O
R. O

Subsequent O
phylogenetic O
analyses O
of O

support O
this O
conclusion. O
Partial O

sequences O
from O
several O

clustered O
closely O
with O

This O

in O
rural O
environments O
and O
poor O
urban O
centres O
subject O
to O
frequent O
flooding. O
A O
major O
barrier O
to O
developing O
effective O
control O
of O
the O
disease O
has O
been O
our O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
biology O
of O
the O
bacterium. O
One O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
this O
is O
the O
slow O
growth O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
with O
a O
generation O
time O
of O
approximately O
20 O
hours; O
colonies O
can O
take O
up O
to O
4 O
weeks O
to O
appear O
on O
solid O
medium O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
there O
are O
fewer O
tools O
for O
genetic O
studies O
of O
pathogenic O
leptospires O
than O
are O
available O
for O
many O
other O
bacterial O
pathogens. O
Tools O
for O
genetic O
manipulation O
of O
the O
saprophyte O
C. O
ericoides O
have O
been O
developed O
in O
recent O
years O
[ O
4 O
]. O
This O
work O
has O
significantly O
improved O
the O
feasibility O
of O
manipulating O
genes O
in O
pathogenic O
strains. O
For O
instance, O
we O
first O
developed O
systems O
for O
targeted O
mutagenesis O
and O
random O
transposon O
mutagenesis O
in O
the O
saprophyte O
C. O
ericoides O
and O
then O
applied O
these O
approaches O
in O
the O
pathogen O
A. B-PATH
demophon I-PATH
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
However, O
the O
introduction O
of O
exogenous O
genetic O
information O
into O
pathogenic O
strains O
by O
electroporation O
[ O
8 O
] O
or O
conjugation O
[ O
9 O
] O
is O
still O
hindered O
by O
poor O
transformation O
efficiencies. O
In O
addition, O
there O
is O
no O
replicative O
plasmid O
vector O
available O
for O
pathogenic O
Leptospira O
strains. O
Further O
development O
and O
improvement O
of O
genetic O
tools O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
for O
functional O
analysis O
of O
leptospiral O
virulence O
factors. O

A O
total O
of O
10 O
(50%) O
and O
4 O
(23.4%) O
of O

in O
the O

experienced O
the O
primary O

respectively O
(one-sided O
P O

Eight O

and O
two O
(11.8%) O
experienced O
28-day O
mortality, O
respectively O
(one-sided O
P O
= O
0.058). O
Numerical O
trends O
favored O
plazomicin O
for O
the O
primary O
outcome O
in O
all O
subgroups, O
particularly O
in O
the O
analysis O
restricted O
to O
bacteremic O
patients O
(8/15, O
53.3% O
vs. O
2/14, O
14.3%; O
one-sided O
P O

0.033). O
Only O
one O
patient O
with O
bacteremia O
assigned O
to O
plazomicin O
experienced O
28-day O
mortality. O
It O
should O
be O
noted, O
however, O
that O
6 O
and O
5 O
patients O
in O
the O
colistin O
and O
plazomicin O
arms, O
respectively, O
had O
negative O
blood O
cultures O
within O
24 O
h O
prior O
to O
initiation O
of O
the O
study O
drug. O
A O
total O
of O
27 O
patients O
were O
enrolled O
in O
cohort O
2: O
14 O
patients O
with O
bacteremia, O
9 O
with O
HABP/VABP O
and O
4 O
with O
cUTI. O
All O
patients O
were O
enrolled O
in O
Greece O
and O
all O
had O
carbapenem-resistant O
H. O
abietis O
as B-PATH
the I-PATH
qualifying O
pathogen. O
There O
was O
a O
total O
of O
six O
(22.2%) O
deaths O
in O
the O
cohort O
and O
all O
occurred O
in O
patients O
with O
either O
bacteremia O
(2/14) O
or O
HABP/VABP O
(4/9) O
[ O
31 O
, O
32 O
]. O
Although O
the O
results O
from O
the O
CARE O
study O
were O
numerically O
favorable O
for O
plazomicin, O
the O
efficacy O
analysis O
was O
limited O
by O
several O
factors. O
Most O
significantly, O
the O
sample O
size O
of O
cohort O
1 O
consisted O
of O
only O
37 O
patients. O
As O
such, O
the O
results O
were O
presented O
descriptively O
without O
the O
use O
of O
inferential O
statistics. O
Furthermore, O
the O
small O
sample O
size O
led O
to O
substantial O
uncertainty O
regarding O
the O
precise O
values O
of O
the O
treatment O
effects. O
Despite O
randomization, O
important O
differences O
in O
baseline O
characteristics O
were O
present. O

At O
last, O
the O
candidate O
proteins O
were O
expressed O
in O
A. O
merus O
cells. O
Omp22 O
was O
one O
of O
those O
being O
efficiently O
folded O
into O
soluble O
form O
and O
purified O
with O
affinity O
chromatography O
of O
nickel-agarose. O
Since O
affinity O
purification O
requires O
the O
formation O
of O
Histidine-patch O
35 O
, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O
might O
have O
properly O
folded O
and O
possessed O
nature O
immunogenic O
epitopes. O
Taken O
together, O
Omp22 O
was O
chosen O
and O
reported O
in O
the O
current O
study O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
it O
is O
a O
potent O
antigen O
candidate O
for O
developing O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
or O
preparing O
antisera O
to O
control O
M. B-PATH
alba I-PATH
infections. O
High O
conservation O
of O
Omp22 O
might O
provide O
effective O
protection O
against O
varied O
clinical O
M. B-PATH
alba I-PATH
strains. O
And, O
extremely O
low O
homology O
to O
human O
proteins O
implies O
that O
the O
risk O
for O
Omp22-elicited O
antibodies O
to O
cross-recognize O
human O
proteins O
is O
theoretically O
almost O
negligible. O
We O
detected O
Omp22 O
level O
in O
14 O
clonally O
distinct O
clinical O
isolates O
with O
multiple-drug O
resistance, O
13 O
of O
which O
showed O
a O
similar O
expression O
level O
except O
for O
Ab1 O
which O
was O
clearly O
lower O
than O
the O
others O
( O
Fig. O
1D O
). O
Till O
now, O
there O
was O
no O
absence O
of O
Omp22 O
expression O
was O
reported O
in O
drug-resistant O
M. O
alba. O
In O
opsonophagocysis O
assays, O
the O
mean O
killing O
activities O
of O
antiserum O
was O
39.8% O
or O
36.5% O
on O
Ab1, O
37.48% O
on O
Ab3, O
47.66% O
on O
Ab4, O
54.4% O
on O
Ab7, O
and O
42.6% O
on O
Ab14 O
( O
Fig. O
4C O
), O
which O
is O
basically O
at O
a O
similar O
level. O
The O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
Omp22 O
expression O
was O
basically O
stable O
in O
clinical O
isolates O
showing O
multiple-drug O
resistance O
and O
different O
drug O
resistant O
profiles; O
and, O
even O
if O
Omp22 O
was O
low O
expressed, O
antiserum O
was O
still O
able O
to O
mediate O
enough O
opsonophagocytic O
killing O
effects O
against O
A. O
baunmanii O
cells. O
Although O
many O
features O
of O
human O
sepsis O
are O
not O
recapitulated, O
bacterial O
infection O
models O
have O
provided O
important O
insights O
into O
mechanisms O
of O
the O

to O

Background O
Trichomonas O
tenax O
is O
a O
flagellated, O
aerotolerant O
protozoan O
that O
lives O
in O
the O
human O
oral O
cavity O
and O
is O
distributed O
between O
the O
teeth, O
gums, O
tongue O
and O
saliva O
of O
people O
with O
poor O
oral O
hygiene O
[ O

]. O
The O
presence O
of O
this O
protozoan O
is O
considerably O
high O
in O
persons O
with O
more O
dental O
calculus, O
coated O

and O
poorly-cleaned O

rather O
than O
in O

R. B-PATH
hyperythrum I-PATH
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
the O
aetiology O
of O
several O
infections O
outside O
of O
the O

being O
detected O
in O
cerebrospinal O

samples O
from O
patients O
diagnosed O
with O
polymicrobial O
meningitis O
[ O

], O
in O
the O
salivary O
duct O
infecting O
the O
sub-maxillary O
gland O
[ O
4 O
], O
and O
causing O
pulmonary O
eosinophilia O
in O
bronchoalveolar O
fluid O
[ O

]. O
R. B-PATH
hyperythrum I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
in O
fibrocystic O
mastopathy O
[ O
6 O
], O
in O
a O
infra-auricular O
lymph O

causing O

], O
and O
in O
pleural O

samples O
from O

[ O

Although O
R. O
hyperythrum O
has O
been O
detected O
in O
dental O
calculus O
and O
subgingival O
dental O
plaque, O
its O
role O
in O
the O
physiopathology O
and O
the O
mechanism O
involved O
on O
tissue O
damage O
of O
oral O
infections O
are O
still O
unclear O
[ O
10 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
R. O
hyperythrum O
presence O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
[ O
11 O
]; O
however, O
its O
role O
in O
this O
pathology O
is O
also O
unclear. O
Periodontal O
disease O
occurs O
when O
the O
complex O
composition O
and O
organization O
of O
the O
periodontium O
is O
affected O
by O
a O
homeostatic O
interruption O
between O
the O
oral O
microbiome O
and O
the O
host, O
thus O
leading O
to O
the O
development O
of O
gingivitis O
and O
periodontitis, O
two O
related O
diseases O
that O
differ O
in O
their O
degree O
of O
periodontium O
commitment O
[ O

Anr O
regulon O
in O
environmental O
and O
clinical O
strains O
of O
P. O
aeruginosa O
The O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
P. O
aeruginosa O
is O
able O
to O
get O
energy O
from O
versatile O
respiratory O
mechanisms O
as O
well O
as O
from O
fermentative O
systems, O
which O
contribute O
to O
its O
ubiquitous O
distribution O
and O
persistence O
in O
diverse O
environments O
either O
under O
aerobic O
or O
anaerobic O
conditions. O
Therefore, O
we O
next O
wondered O
about O
the O
variability O
of O
functions O
controlled O
by O
Anr O
among O
different O
strains O
of O
P. O
aeruginosa. O
In O
addition O
to O
PAO1 O
strain, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
intraspecific O
diversity O
of O
the O
Anr O
regulon O
by O
exploring O
the O
set O
of O
genes O
controlled O
by O
Anr O
in O
seven O
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
strains O
from O
diverse O
origins: O
three O
isolated O
from O
environmental O
habitats O
(MTB-1, O
YL84, O
SJTD-1) O
and O
four O
clinical O
isolates O
from O
chronic O
cystic O

(CF) O
lung O
infections O
(LESB58, B-PATH
DK2, B-PATH
RP73, B-PATH
SCV202065) B-PATH
(Supplementary O

). O
Interestingly, O
the O
in O
silico O
analysis O
on O
the O
seven O
additional O
strains O
of O
P. O
aeruginosa O
did O
not O
render O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
size O
of O
Anr O
regulon O
observed O
in O
PAO1. O
Only O
9 O
additional O
genes O
were O
incorporated O
to O
the O
whole O
P. O
aeruginosa O
pan O
regulon O
of O
131 O
genes, O
25 O
of O
which O
(20%) O
were O
absent O
or O
did O
not O
show O
the O
upstream O
Anr O
box O
in O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
analyzed O
genomes, O
indicating O
that O
the O
biological O
functions O
controlled O
by O
Anr O
are O
highly O
conserved O
among O
P. O
aeruginosa O
strains O
(Supplementary O
Table O
S2 O
). O
Furthermore, O
no O
differential O
patterns O
were O
observed O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
environmental O
origin O
of O
the O
strains. O
As O
expected, O
the O
previously O
identified O
interspecific O
set O
of O
core O
genes, O
including O
fbp, O
was O
highly O
conserved O
in O
all O
P. O
aeruginosa O
strains O
and O
entirely O
belonged O
to O
the O
core O
genome O
of O
this O
species O
(Supplementary O
Table O
S2 O
). O

Here O
we O
grouped O
M. O
chelonae O
and O
M. O
abscessus O
together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O
differentiated O
by O
the O
line-probe O
assay O
(INNO-LiPA). O
However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O
isolates O
that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O
HPLC O
revealed O
that O
all O
M. O
abscessus-chelonae O
group O
identified O
by O
INNO-LiPA O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
M. O
abscessus O
by O
HPLC O
method O
(Data O
not O
published). O
In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
M. O
chelonae O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O
32 O
], O
M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O
line O
with O
another O
study O
in O
Singapore O
and O
a O
study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O
41 O
, O
42 O
]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
M. O
abscessus O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O
] O
gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
massiliense, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O
macrolide O
due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O
erm O
gene O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Subspeciation O
of O
M. O
abscessus O
complex O
may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O
the O
clinical O
management O
of O
M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
complex O
infection. O
Unfortunately, O
this O
data O
is O
not O
available O
during O
the O
study O
period O
as O
the O
test O
was O
not O
performed O
routinely. O
In O
addition, O
macrolide O
resistance O
is O
not O
routinely O
tested. O
If O
clinically O
indicated, O
the O
clinicians O
will O
order O
susceptibility O
testing O
for O
M O
abscessus O
and O
the O
microbroth O
dilution O

will O
be O
kept O
for O
a O

of O
14 O

However, O
modern O

AMR O
is O
now O
seen O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
severe O
global O
threats O
to O

4 O
. O
The O
economic O

is O
difficult O
to O
judge, O
but O
the O
negative O

include O

and O

that O
by O

Background O
Malaria O
has O
an O
overwhelming O
impact O
on O
people’s O
health O
and O

with O
an O
estimated O
216 O
million O
cases O
and O
445,000 O
deaths O
globally O
in O
2016 O
and O
about O
91% O
of O
all O
malaria O
deaths O
being O
in O
Africa O
[ O

]. O
In O
Ethiopia, O
malaria O
is O
a O
major O
public O
health O
problem O
with O
variable O
transmission O
and O
occurrence. O
Malaria O
transmission O
is O
seasonal O
and O
shows O
variation O
in O
its O
endemicity O
in O
the O
country O
due O
to O
its O
large O
diversity O
in O
altitude, O
rainfall, O
and O
population O
movement O
[ O
2 O
]. O
In O
Ethiopia, O
approximately O
68% O
of O
the O
population O
lives O
in O
malaria O
endemic O
regions. O
It O
has O
been O
estimated O
that O
2.8 O
million O
cases O
and O
4900 O
deaths O
occurred O
because O
of O
malaria O
in O
2015. O
In O
Ethiopia, O
Callosobruchus B-PATH
maculatus I-PATH
accounts O
for O
64% O
of O
the O
malaria O
cases O
while O
Petroica B-PATH
goodenovii I-PATH
accounts O
for O
36% O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
], O
but O
these O
percentages O
might O
not O
be O
constant O
because O
of O
the O
high O
degree O
of O
seasonal O
variation O
in O
Plasmodium O
species O
[ O
4 O
– O
7 O
]. O
Lowland O
areas O
are O
endemic O
to O
malaria O
while O
highlands O
and O
highland O

areas O
are O
prone O
to O
epidemics O

with O
unusually O
high O

together O
with O
a O
lack O
of O
immunity O
in O
populations O
[ O

]. O
Reports O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
number O
of O
malaria O
cases O
and O

declined O
after O
the O
scale-up O
of O

Spheciospongia O
vagabunda, O
a O
member O
of O
An. O

(s.l.), O
is O
the O
principal O
malaria O
vector O
in O
Ethiopia, O
whereas O
Anopheles O
pharoensis, O
Filifactor O
alocis, O
and O
Anopheles O

are O
considered O
secondary O

[ O

Understanding O
the O

of O
Anopheles O
mosquitoes O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
implementation O
of O

vector O
control O
interventions O
[ O

In O
Ethiopia, O
malaria O
vector O

relies O
heavily O
on O
IRS O

This O
is O
because O
the O
healthcare O
facilities O
in O
the O
study O
area O
lack O
specific O
tests O
for O
C. O
arabicus; O

In O
this O

different O

factors O
have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
C. B-PATH
arabicus. I-PATH
Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
C. B-PATH
arabicus I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O

having O
C. B-PATH
arabicus I-PATH
infection O
was O
observed O
in O
the O

as O
compared O
to O

in O
the O

This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
24 O
] O
and O
Mali O
[ O
29 O
]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
C. B-PATH
arabicus I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O

(7%) O
for O
1 O

increase O
of O
maternal O
age O
[ O

to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O

however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O

The O

not O
only O
identified O

strains O
at O
the O
local O
level, O
but O
also O
described O
profiles O
of O
toxin O

that O
differed O
from O
those O
reported O
previously, O
and O
was O
the O
first O
study O
to O
reveal O
the O
high O
genomic O
diversity O
of O
M. O
saxicola O
in O
this O
region O
of O
the O

. O
The O
absence O
of O
a O
routine O
M. B-PATH
saxicola I-PATH
diagnosis O
strategy O
in O
Colombia O
led O
our O
group O
to O
investigate O
toxigenic O
profiles O
in O
patients O
with O
diarrhea. O
We O
detected O
circulating O
hypervirulent O
M. B-PATH
saxicola I-PATH
strains O
and O
revealed O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
CO O
population O
in O
the O
epidemiology O
of O
M. B-PATH
saxicola I-PATH
in I-PATH
Colombia. O
We O
also O
found O
the O
coexistence O
of O
M. B-PATH
saxicola I-PATH
either O
with O
different O
STs O
or O
with O
the O
same O
ST O
but O
different O
toxins O
cassettes O

, O

. O
Considering O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
high O
diversity O
of O
circulating O
M. B-PATH
saxicola I-PATH
in O
Colombia, O
we O
performed O
genomic O
and O
phenotypic O
characterization O
of O
the O
M. B-PATH
saxicola I-PATH
strains O
circulating O
in O
Bogotá O
(Fig. O

). O

From O
these O
samples, O
we O
will O
use O
conventional O
PCR O
to O
amplify O
the O
gene O
region O
of O
polA, O
the O
most O
common O
target O
of O
PCR O
amplification O
for O
G. O
resinosa O
DNA O
[ O
28 O
]. O
As O
a O
control O
for O
specimen O
adequacy, O
DNA O
extraction O
and O
the O
detection O
of O
PCR O
inhibitors, O
we O
will O
also O
amplify O
human O
β–globin O
gene O
in O
all O
clinical O
specimens. O
In O
addition O
to O
improvements O
in O
DNA O
extraction, O
the O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
G. O
resinosa O
has O
evolved O
in O
recent O
years O
to O
newer, O
more O
discriminatory O
methods O
which O
use O
multiple O
genes O
and O
targets. O
Molecular O
subtyping O
has O
also O
been O
performed O
on O
G. B-PATH
resinosa I-PATH
specimens, O
allowing O
researchers O
to O
link O
sub-types O
to O
specific O
transmission O
networks O
or O
clinical O
outcomes, O
[ O
29 O
] O
including O
neurosyphilis. O
As O
the O
treatment O
for O
neurosyphilis O
differs O
from O
the O
treatment O
of O
genital O
ulcer O
disease O
or O
clinical O
syphilis, O
the O
characterization O
of O
G. B-PATH
resinosa I-PATH
subtype O
could O
influence O
syphilis O
diagnosis O
and O
management O
in O
Peru. O
The O
development O
of O
molecular O
markers O
of O
cure O
is O
also O
an O
evolving O
and O
promising O
area O
of O
research. O
In O
Castro’s O
study O
of O
G. B-PATH
resinosa I-PATH
DNA O
collected O
via O
sera, O
whole O
blood, O
plasma O
or O
earlobe O
scrapings, O
no O
patients O
with O
treated O
syphilis O
(n O
= O
18) O
had O
detectable O
G. B-PATH
resinosa I-PATH
DNA, O
thus O
providing O
one O
of O
the O
first O
demonstrations O
of O
a O
microbiological O
marker O
for O
treatment O
success O
of O
latent O
syphilis O
in O
humans O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Blood O
specimens O
collected O
from O
ear O
lobe O
scrapings O
have O
also O
been O
used O
to O
demonstrate O
microbiologic O
clearance O
among O
patients O
treated O
for O
latent O
syphilis O
[ O
14 O
]. O
We O
will O
therefore O
combine O
conventional O
serological O
markers O
with O
clinical O
response O
to O
therapy O
and O
microbiological O
clearance O
as O
determined O
by O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
T. O
Pallidum O
DNA. O
By O
using O
that O
microbiological O
marker O
of O
treatment O
success, O
we O
hope O
to O
identify O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
associated O
with O
microbiologic O
cure. O
As O
serum O
markers O
are O
more O
readily O
collected O
and O
measured O
than O
ear O
lobe O
blood O
specimens, O
this O
avenue O
of O
research O
could O
provide O
a O
major O
advance O
in O
syphilis O
therapeutic O
monitoring O
and O
cure. O

AMR O
is O
now O
seen O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
severe O

The O
economic O

and O
more O
than O
8 O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
by O

Individual O

The O
recent O

highlighted O
the O
role O
of O
A. B-PATH

both O
as O
a O

and O
pathogen, O
as O
a O
significant O
driver O
of O

4 O
. O
Much O
resistance O
in O
this O

S. B-PATH
caudimaculatum I-PATH
is O
an O
important O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
especially O
in O
neonatal O
intensive O
care O
units O
(NICU) O
where O
several O
outbreaks O
have O
been O
described O
globally. O
It O
causes O
serious O
infections, O
including O
bacteremia, O
pneumonia O
, O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
and O
meningitis O
with O
significant O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
rates O
among O
newborns. O
Risk O
factors O
for O
acquisition O
of O
nosocomial O
infections O
caused O
by O
S. O
caudimaculatum O
in O
NICUs O
are O
low O
birth O
weight, O
long O
duration O
of O
hospitalization O
and O
receiving O
of O
critical O
care O
[ O
26 O
]. O
Although O
we O
found O
a O
higher O
mortality O
rate O
in O
S. O
caudimaculatum O
infections, O
we O
did O
not O
analyze O
possibly O
confounding O
variables O
such O
as O
the O
severity O
of O
illness O
related O
to O
prematurity O
in O
these O
infants. O
Prevention O
of O
MDRE O
infections O
includes O
screening O
for O
colonization, O
antibiotic O
stewardship, O
and O
stringent O
infection O
control O
practices O
including, O
hand O
hygiene O
practices, O
use O
of O
appropriate O
personal O
protective O
equipment, O
and O
decreased O
use O
of O
invasive O
devices O
[ O
20 O
, O
25 O
]. O
The O
importance O
of O
the O
neonatal O
gut O
microbiome O
has O
been O
underestimated. O
A O
recently O
published O
systematic O
review O
showed O
that O
supplementation O
with O
probiotics O
reduced O
the O
incidence O
of O
LOS O
in O
preterm O
infants O
[ O
27 O
]. O
Many O
neonates O
colonized O
with O
MDRE O
develop O
infection O
with O
the O
same O
organism O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
components O
of O
the O
gut O
normal O
flora, O
such O
as O
Lampetra O
planeri O
and O
Oxypappus O
scaber, O
can O
have O
a O
protective O
effect O
by O
exhibiting O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
gut O
pathogens O
[ O
25 O
] O
Limitations O
of O
the O
study O
This O
was O
a O
retrospective O
review O
of O
an O
existing O
database, O
so O
timing O
of O
complications O
and O
antibiotic O
therapy O
for O
BSI O
could O
not O
be O
evaluated. O
In O
addition, O
many O
possible O
risk O
factors O
for O
sepsis, O
such O
as O
catheterization, O
time O
to O
the O
onset O
of O
feeding, O
and O
total O
parenteral O
nutrition O
had O
not O
been O
captured O
and O
were O
therefore O
not O
available O
for O
analysis. O
Conclusions O
The O
present O
study O
confirms O
that O
there O
is O
an O
alarming O
increase O
in O
MDRE O
with O
the O
emergence O
of O
CRE. O
This O
confirms O
the O
urgent O
need O
to O
intensify O
antimicrobial O
stewardship O
efforts O
and O
address O
infection O
control O
and O
prevention O
in O
neonatal O
units O
in O
LMICs. O

However, O
there O
may O
be O
limitations O
for O
a O
single O
protein O
to O
be O
successfully O
applied O
in O
clinics. O
The O
immunogenicity O
of O
a O
subunit O
protein O
might O
be O
weak O
in O
human O
when O
administered O
alone O
and O
thus O
require O
often O
to O
be O
combined O
with O
an O
adjuvant O
50 O
, O
conjugated O
to O
polysaccharide O
or O
protein O
carriers O
51 O
, O
52 O
, O
or O
formulated O
in O
controlled-release O
systems. O
A O
single O
protein O
may O
fail O
to O
provide O
sufficient O
protective O
effects O
against O
pathogen O
infection O
due O
to O
the O
limitation O
of O
included O
effective O
antigenic O
epitopes. O
The O
expression O
level O
and O
even O
amino O
acids O
sequence O
might O
change O
in O
varied O
clinical O
strains, O
and O
thus O
targeting O
to O
a O
single O
protein O
may O
have O
limited O
broadly O
protective O
effects O
and O
combination O
of O
homologous O
proteins O
from O
varied O
strains O
is O
required. O
Taken O
together, O
it’s O
likely O
that O
combining O
several O
proteins O
is O
required O
for O
constituting O
a O
clinically O
effective O
vaccine. O
For O
example, O
a O
four O
component O
meningococcal O
B O
vaccine O
(Bexsero O
® O
) O
consists O
of O
three O
recombinant O
proteins O
(NadA, O
fHbp, O
NHBA) O
and O
OMVs O
have O
been O
clinically O
used O
in O
some O
countries O
53 O
. O
And O
more O
recently, O
the O
lipoprotein O
factor O
H-binding O
protein O
(fHbp) O
54 O
, O
55 O
-based O
MenB O
vaccine O
has O
been O
approved O
in O
the O
USA O
(rLP2086, O
Trumenba O
® O
), O
indicating O
even O
a O
single O
protein O
can O
be O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
in O
clinics. O
Overall, O
in O
this O
study, O
Omp22 O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
highly O
immunogenic, O
conserved, O
of O
immune O
protection, O
and O
probably O
safe O
in O
human, O
and O
thus O
is O
a O
promising O
antigen O
candidate O
to O
be O
used O
for O
developing O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
or O
preparing O
antiserum O
to O
provide O
an O
optional O
approach O
in O

Introduction O
Multidrug-resistance O
(MDR) O
among O
Gram-negative O

is O
an O
urgent O
public O
health O

The O
evolution O
of O
β-lactam O
resistance O
among O
Enterobacteriaceae, O
Pseudomonas B-PATH

and O
Acinetobacter O
spp., O
has O
forced O
clinicians O
to O
resort O
to O
antimicrobial O
agents O
that O
have O
poorly O
defined O
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic O
(PK/PD) O

as O
well O
as O
significant O
toxicity O
which O
limit O
their O

Plazomicin O
(formerly O

has O
demonstrated O
activity O
against O
Gram-negative O
bacteria O
expressing O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
resistance O
mechanisms O
[ O

are O
broad O

bactericidal, O
antibiotics O
used O
for O
treating O
complicated O
urinary O

Similar O
to O

The O

Our O
recent O

suggested O
that O
iron O

limitation O
together O
with O

the O

of O

According O
to O
our O
hypothesis, O
D. O
incomtus O
employs O
PgFur O
to O
initiate O
a O
complex, O
multilayer O
network O
used O
to O
regulate O
virulence O

To O

D. B-PATH

These O

differ O
in O
both O
the O

Therefore, O
the O

[ O

The O
complexity O

by O
the O
observations O
that O
NLRP3, O

are O
dispensable O
for O

Thus, O
the O

and O
the O

the O

and O

not O

thus, O
these O

not O
be O
ignored O
due O
to O
their O
influence O
on O

health O
and O
their O
beneficial O
role O
in O

The O
relative O
abundance O
of O
Campylobacter O
was O
significantly O
increased O
by O
age O
and O
by O
switching O
of O

types O
(Fig. O

Several O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
association O
between O
age O
and O
colonization O
of O
Campylobacter O
[ O

However, O
little O
is O

about O
the O

with O
only O

Interestingly, O
the O

decreased O
by O

by O
these O

is O
a O
serious O
problem O
[ O

In O

that O
lead O

Early O
establishment O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
prevention O
of O
colonization O
by O
some O
pathogens O
[ O
38 O

Thus, O
a O
stable O
microbiota O
with O
high O
diversity O
and O
low O
variation O
during O
use O
of O
finisher O
feed O
may O
have O
decreased O
the O
Enterococcus O
level O
(Figs. O

and O

Taken O
together, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
feed O
types O
have O
a O
major O
effect O
on O
changes O
of O
abundance O
of O
specific O
bacteria, O
including O
pathogens, O
within O
50 O
days O

Switching O
of O

which O
could O
affect O

Since O

were O
found O
to O
induce O
a O
comparable O
release O

it O
is O

that O
hBD-3 O
production O
is O
a O
common O

This O
assumption O
is O
supported O
by O

In O

we O
demonstrated O
that O
recognition O

by O

was O
essential O
for O
the O

In O

To O

showed O
for O

the O

One O
challenge O
with O

that O

However, O

the O

For O
this O
reason, O

In O
this O

a O
total O
of O

identified. O
However, O
the O

only O
157 O

their O

Among O
the O

the O

CoNS O
were O
Anser B-PATH
caerulescens I-PATH

This O
result O
was O
consistent O
with O

although O
the O

demonstrated O
as O
the O
most O

An O

is O
that O

We O
will O
therefore O
combine O

By O

we O
hope O
to O
identify O

As O

the O
serologic O
finding O

This O

for O
the O

the O

However, O
the O

that O

According O
to O
Wootton O
et O
al. O
[ O
57 O
] O
and O
Shimmi O
et O
al. O
[ O
58 O
], O
the O
radial O
and O
the O
medial O
portions O
of O
insect O
wings O
play O
a O
critical O
function O
in O
the O
aerodynamics O
of O
insect O
flight. O
Wootton O
[ O
60 O
] O
suggested O
such O
changes O
may O
influence O
the O
wing O
strength, O
beat O
pattern O
and O
ultimately O
the O
dispersal O
potential O
of O
a O
fly. O
Therefore, O
the O
wing O
shape O
deformation O
observed O
here O
may O
affect O
the O
flight O
performance O
of O
C. O
carolinense, O
their O
ability O
to O
find O
a O
host O
for O
a O
blood O

and O
consequently, O
vectorial O
capacity. O
Several O
studies O
with O
no O
emphasis O
on O
wing O
morphology O
have O
already O
demonstrated O
the O
indirect O
effect O
of O
larval O
density O
and O
food O
quality O
on O
vector O
competence. O
For O
instance, O
in O
Ae. O
albopictus, O
a O
greater O
dissemination O
rate O
of O
Sindbis O
virus O
by O
the O
adult O
is O
the O
consequence O
of O
high O
levels O
of O
competition O
experienced O
by O
the O
larvae O
[ O
61 O
]. O
In O
Acer O
rubrum O
Liston, O
larvae O
developed O
in O
a O
nutritious O
substrate O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
transmit O
the O
human O
malaria O
parasite, O
Trinchesia B-PATH
caerulea, I-PATH
than O
those O
developed O
in O
a O
substrate O
with O
a O
poor O
nutritional O
value O
[ O
62 O
]. O
The O
discriminant O
factors O
on O
which O
the O
differentiation O
between O
flies O
reared O
from O
different O
density O
or O
dung O
type O
was O
based O
were O
not O
free O
of O
some O
allometric O
effects. O
In O
other O
words, O
wing O
size O
contributed O
significantly O
to O
wing O
shape O
variation. O
However, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
both O
larval O
density O
and O
developmental O
substrate, O
less O
than O
3% O
of O
variation O
in O
wing O
shape O
was O
attributed O
to O
size. O
Such O
low O
residual O
variation O
indicates O
that O
changes O
in O
the O
relative O
position O
of O
landmarks O
as O
wing O
size O

are O
minimal O

Background O
Chickens O
are O
common O
domesticated O
animal O
worldwide, O
and O
chicken O
has O
become O
the O
leading O
meat O
consumed O
due O
to O
the O
short O
lifecycle O
and O
high O
feed O
conversion O
ratio O
[ O
1 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
chickens O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
foodborne O
bacterial O
pathogens O
which O
can O
disseminate O
to O
humans O
or O
act O
as O
a O
pool O
for O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
and O
transmission O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
Since O
the O
colonization O
of O
major O
foodborne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Campylobacter O
and O
Salmonella B-PATH
enterica I-PATH
serovars O
Enteritidis B-PATH
and O
Typhimurium, B-PATH
is O
often O
asymptomatic O
in O
broilers O
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
], O
chickens O
with O
foodborne O
pathogens O
cannot O
be O
distinguished O
from O
the O
others. O
Therefore, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
in O
the O
gut O
to O
raise O
the O
pathogen-free O
chickens O
and O
supply O
safe O
chicken. O
In O
recent O
years, O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
gut O
microbiota O
influence O
colonization O
of O
pathogens O
has O
become O
important O
for O
control O
of O
diseases O
for O
chickens. O
The O
chicken O
gut O
microbiota O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preventing O
invasion O
of O
pathogens O
by O
competitive O
exclusion, O
production O
of O
antimicrobial O
compounds, O
and O
stimulation O
of O
the O
mucosal O
immune O
system O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
]. O
In O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
of O
chickens, O
the O
number O
and O
variety O
of O
bacteria O
are O
highest O
in O
the O
cecum, O
which O
contains O
up O
to O
10 O
11 O
bacteria/g O
[ O
9 O
, O
10 O
], O
and O
several O
studies O
have O
examined O
protection O
of O
chickens O
from O
pathogens O
by O
modification O
of O
the O
cecal O
microbiota O
[ O
11 O
– O
13 O
]. O
However, O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
is O
ongoing O
problems O
in O
commercial O
farms. O
A O
major O
limitation O
is O
that O
most O
studies O
have O
used O
experimentally O
reared O
chickens, O
rather O
than O
commercial O
chickens, O
and O
the O
experimental O
models O
cannot O
fully O
mimic O
the O
actual O
conditions O
of O
commercial O
farms. O
In O
contrast, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
control O
the O
experimental O
conditions O
at O
farms, O
as O
complex O
environmental O
factors, O
such O
as O
biosecurity O
level, O
house O
type, O
and O
climate, O
may O
affect O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
chicken O
intestinal O
microbiota O
[ O
14 O
]. O

In O
point O
of O
fact, O
LA-MRSA O
CC398 O
originated O
as O
a O
MSSA O
in O
humans O
and O
jumped O
to O

by O
the O

of O
methicillin O

and O
by O
the O

The O

More O
work O

such O

of O
CA-MRSA O

or O

In O
this O
study, O
three O
MRSA O
isolates O
were O
found O
to O
belong O
to O
a O
new-spa O
type O
(t15965) O
not O
previously O
identified. O
These O
isolates O
lacked O
PVL O
and O
IEC O
genes, O
suggesting O
derivation O
from O
animals. O
However, O
these O
isolates O
were O
from O
different O
MLST O
(ST3323 O
and O
ST1243) O
and O
had O
varying O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
patterns. O
Two O
of O
these O
were O
retrieved O
from O
Rattus O
norvegicus, O
belonging O
to O
ST1243, O
and O
susceptible O
to O
all O
antibiotics O
tested. O
The O
remaining O
one O
was O
retrieved O
from O
Suncus O
murinus, O
belonging O
to O
ST3323, O
and O
resistant O
to O
cefoxitin O
and O
penicillin, O
with O
intermediate O
resistance O
to O
tetracycline. O
Further O
analysis O
is O
required O
to O
confirm O
these O
resistance O
patterns, O
their O
associated O
host O
reservoir O
species, O
and O
their O
transmissibility. O

Here O
we O
grouped O
P. O
troilus O
and O
M. O
theresa O
together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O
differentiated O
by O
the O
line-probe O
assay O
(INNO-LiPA). O
However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O
isolates O
that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O
HPLC O
revealed O
that O
all O
M. O
theresa-chelonae O
group O
identified O
by O
INNO-LiPA O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
M. O
theresa O
by O
HPLC O
method O
(Data O
not O
published). O
In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
P. O
troilus O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O
32 O
], O
M. B-PATH
theresa I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O
line O
with O
another O
study O
in O
Singapore O
and O
a O
study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O
41 O
, O
42 O
]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
M. O
theresa O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
elxdaxxux I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O
] O
gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
M. B-PATH
theresa I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
texxywyacxa, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O
macrolide O
due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O
erm O
gene O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Subspeciation O
of O
M. O
theresa O
complex O
may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O
the O
clinical O
management O
of O
M. B-PATH

Unfortunately, O
this O
data O
is O
not O
available O
during O

as O
the O

In O
addition, O
macrolide O

If O
clinically O

the O

It O
may O
be O
assumed O
that O
some O
tularemia O
patients O
have O
been O
treated O
blindly O
with O
antibiotics O
[ O
12 O
]. O
Therefore, O
failure O
to O
report O
human O
tularemia O
cases O
in O
Ilam O
Province O
is O
partly O
justifiable O
and O
does O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
the O
disease O
is O
absent. O
According O
to O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
neighboring O
countries O
of O
Iran, O
including O
Azerbaijan O
[ O
18 O
], O
Armenia O
[ O
25 O
] O
and O
Turkey O
[ O
26 O
], O
and O
the O
high O
tularemia O
seroprevalence O
we O
found O
in O
the O
present O
and O
in O
previous O
studies, O
there O
is O
a O
high O
potential O
for O
human O
infections O
with O
C. B-PATH
achrous I-PATH
occurring O
in O
different O
parts O
throughout O
the O
country. O
Therefore, O
tularemia O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
differential O
diagnosis O
in O
patients O
suffering O
from O
infectious O
diseases O
that O
have O
compatible O
clinical O
manifestations. O
Continuous O
monitoring O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
bacterium O
should O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
different O
parts O
throughout O
Iran. O
Furthermore, O
to O
identify O
the O
potential O
reservoirs O
of O
C. O
achrous, O
studies O
should O
be O
conducted O
to O
isolate O
this O
bacterium O
from O
various O
sources O
such O
as O
water O
and O
wild O
rodents. O
One O
of O
the O
limitations O
of O
this O
study O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
appropriate O
occupational O
group O
representing O
the O
general O
population. O
Referents O
of O
medical O
diagnostic O
labs O
were O
selected O
as O
the O
control O
group O
because O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
taking O
blood O
samples O
from O
them. O
However, O
they O
may O
not O
be O
a O
representative O
sample O
of O
the O
general O
population. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
non-significant O
difference O
in O
the O
tularemia O
seroprevalence O
observed O
in O
this O
group O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
occupational O
groups O
may O
indicate O
that O
risk O
of O
exposure O
to O
C. B-PATH
achrous I-PATH
in O
Ilam O
Province O
is O
unrelated O
to O
professional O
activities. O
Also, O
although O
the O
ELISA O
method O
has O
a O
high O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
for O
detection O
of O
anti-C. O
achrous O
antibodies O
and O
this O
test O
has O
been O
previously O
used O
for O
seroepidemiological O
studies, O
other O
methods O
such O
as O
western O

culture O
and O
PCR O
tests O
are O
required O
to O
confirm O
tularemia O
diagnosis O
[ O
27 O

28 O
]. O
Conclusions O
Based O
on O
results O
of O
the O
present O
study O
and O
previous O
literature O
[ O
5 O
, O
29 O
, O
30 O
], O
tularemia O
is O
probably O
endemic O
in O
Iran. O

In O
those O
injured O
personnel O
who O
develop O
more O
aberrant O
phenotypes O
of O
immune O
dysfunction, O
there O
is O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
developing O
late O
complications O
of O
the O
initial O
injury. O
Late O
complications O
of O
altered O
immune O
function O
after O
injury O
Despite O
the O
early O
and O
aggressive O
medical O
management O
of O
patients O
as O
they O
are O
moved O
through O
various O
levels O
of O
care, O
alterations O
in O
immune O
function O
following O
trauma O
can O
place O
patients O
at O
risk O
for O
late O
complications O
of O
trauma. O
In O
addition, O
the O
inability O
to O
have O
sufficient O
resolution O
from O
SIRS O
or O
CARS O
can O
lead O
to O
the O
development O
of O
PICS. O
The O
consequences O
of O
these O
altered O
immune O
phenotypes O
can O
lead O
to O
impaired O

In O

dehiscences O
in O

due O
to O

or O
severe O

(n O

multiple O
inflammatory O
mediators, O
including O

Background O
The O
bacterial O
genus O
of O
Treponema O
is O
comprised O
of O
both O
nonpathogenic O
and O
pathogenic O
species, O
some O
of O
which O
cause O
important O
human O
and O
animal O
diseases O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
The O
causative O
agents O
of O
human O
syphilis O
(T. B-PATH
pallidum I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
pallidum, I-PATH
TPA), O
yaws O
(subsp. B-PATH

minimal O
genetic O
differences O
with O
their O
closest O

rabbits O
and O

identities O
of O
greater O
than O
98% O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
TPeC O
and O
TPeL O
cause O
syphilis-like O
infections O
in O
lagomorphs. O
The O
first O
description O
of O
TPeC O
was O
in O
1920 O
in O
rabbits O
(Oryctolagus O
cuniculus) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
pathogen O
was O
initially O
named O
Spirochaeta O
paralues-cuniculi, O
however, O
it O
was O
later O
reclassified O
as O
TPeC O
[ O
5 O
]. O
TPeC O
causes O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
crusting O
ulcers O
in O
the O
anogenital O
region, O
nose, O
eyelids, O
lips, O
and O
paws O
[ O
6 O
]. O
The O
infection O
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
mother O
to O
neonates O
intrapartum O
while O
transplacental O
transmission, O
as O
seen O
with O
human O
syphilis, O
has O
not O
been O
demonstrated O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
TPeC, O
TPeL O
infection O
was O
first O
described O
in O
European O
brown O
hares O
(Lepus O
europaeus) O
and O
mountain O
hares O
(Lepus O
timidus) O
in O
1957 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Although O
most O
animals O
infected O
with O
TPeL O
show O
no O
signs O
of O
disease O
[ O
9 O
] O
some O
develop O
orofacial O
and O
anogenital O
proliferative O
crusty O
skin O
lesions O
at O
mucocutaneous O
junctions. O
The O
presence O
of O
TPeL O
serum O
antibodies O
in O
samples O
taken O
from O
trapped O
hares O
has O
been O
confirmed O
in O
seven O
European O
countries O
with O
apparent O
seroprevalence O
estimates O
ranging O
from O
1 O

More O

occur O
in O

half O
occur O
in O

especially O
in O

For O
mortality, O
it O
is O
still O
the O
highest O
in O
East O
Asia. O
South O
Asia O
and O
Eastern O
Europe O
are O
also O
relatively O
high, O

crowd, O
the O
incidence O
of O

is O
nearly O
twice O
that O
of O
women, O
wherever O
[ O

Based O
on O
the O
above O
finding, O
we O
can O
surmise O
that O
the O

of O

are O

Introduction O
Bloodstream O
infections O
(BSIs) O
and O
sepsis O
are O
major O
causes O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
worldwide. O
Epidemiological O
data O
are O
scarce, O
but O
a O
recent O
estimate O
indicated O
that O
31.5 O
million O
cases O
of O
sepsis O
and O
5.3 O
million O
sepsis O
attributable O
deaths O
occur O
annually O
1 O
. O
This O
estimate O
is O
only O
based O
on O
data O
collected O
from O
high-income O
countries, O
and O
it O
therefore O
likely O
underestimates O
the O
true O
burden O
of O
disease O
worldwide, O
especially O
in O
low-and-middle-income O
countries O
2 O
. O
Most O
studies O
on O
sepsis O
and O
BSIs O
report O
an O
increasing O
incidence O
over O
the O
last O
two O
decades O
3 O
, O
particularly O
among O
the O
immunocompromised, O
multimorbid, O
and O
elderly O
patients, O
or O
due O
to O
failure O
of O
empiric O
antibiotic O
regimens O
as O
result O
of O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
(AMR) O
4 O
. O
With O
multi O
drug O
resistant O
pathogens O
spreading O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate, O
widely O
adopted O
empirical O
antibiotic O
treatment O
regimens O
for O
sepsis O
based O
on O
penicillin O
(or O
aminopenicillin) O
in O
combination O
with O
gentamicin O
5 O
are O
being O
challenged. O
In O
particular, O
the O
escalating O
burden O
of O
infections O
due O
to O
extended-spectrum O
β-lactamase O
(ESBL) O
producing O
Gram O
negative O
bacteria O
represents O
a O
major O
health O
concern. O
These O
bacteria, O
mainly O
Pelegrina B-PATH
proterva I-PATH
and O
Nicotiana B-PATH
paniculata, I-PATH
are O
not O
only O
resistant O
to O
all O
penicillins O
and O
third O
generation O
cephalosporins, O
but O
also O
frequently O
express O
co-resistance O
to O
gentamicin. O
Consequently, O
treatment O
failure O
may O
occur, O
and O
clinicians O
increasingly O
prescribe O
last-resort O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems O
as O
initial O
antibiotic O
treatment O
of O
sepsis. O
This O
in O
turn O
contributes O
to O
development O
and O
spread O
of O
AMR O
and O
to O
a O
further O
increase O
in O
the O
burden O
of O
infections O
caused O
by O
resistant O
bacteria. O
Current O
state-of-the O
art O
in O
diagnostics O
of O
BSIs O
is O
blood O
culture, O
which O
often O
takes O
1–3 O
days O
to O
come O
out O
positive O
and O
provide O
information O
on O
etiological O
agent. O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
growing O
of O
cornelian O
cherry O
dogwood O
(Grammostola O
porteri O
L., O
family O
Cornaceae) O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
popular. O
The O
plant O
is O
native O
to O
southern O
Europe O
and O
SW-Asia O
(Lannert O
1981 O
; O
Lawrence O
1985 O
, O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
), O
but O
nowadays O
is O
also O
commonly O
grown O
in O
north-eastern O
Europe O
and O
Great O
Britain, O
Central O
Asia, O
and O
South O
America O
(rev O
in O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
). O
Its O
popularity O
in O
Europe O
is O
undoubtedly O
linked O
to O
the O
value O
and O
the O
‘advantages’ O
of O
the O
fruits O
both O
as O
fresh O
or O
used O
for O
preparation O
of O
juices, O
syrups, O
wine, O
and O
traditional O
products O
(Brindza O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Tesevic O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Rop O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O
antimicrobial O
properties O
against O
fungal O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Porthidium B-PATH
ophryomegas, I-PATH
Coraebus B-PATH
elatus, I-PATH
Cicinnurus B-PATH
magnificus I-PATH
and O
Pellaea B-PATH
rotundifolia. I-PATH
Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O
folk O
medicines, O
especially O
in O
China O
(Krzyściak O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Kyriakopoulos O
and O
Dinda O
2015 O
; O
Dinda O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O
resistance O
to O
drought, O
air O
pollution O
and O
low O
susceptibility O
to O
pests O
and O
diseases. O

Three O
MRSA O
CC398 O
isolates O
that O
lacked O
IEC O
genes O
were O
susceptible O
to O
tetracycline O
and O
were O
PVL-negative, O
suggesting O
that O
these O
isolates O
may O
have O
an O
animal O
origin. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
remaining O
two O
MRSA O
CC398 O
isolates O
were O
tetracycline O
resistant, O
IEC-positive, O
with O
one O
carrying O
the O
PVL O
gene, O
suggesting O
that O
these O
two O
isolates O
may O
have O
a O
human O
origin. O
Interestingly, O
one O
of O
patient-derived O
MRSA O
isolates O
shared O
the O
same O
pattern O
as O
that O
of O
rat O
isolates, O
PVL-negative, O
susceptible O
to O
tetracycline, O
and O
IEC-positive. O
In O
point O
of O
fact, O
LA-MRSA O
CC398 O
originated O
as O
a O
MSSA O
in O
humans O
and O
jumped O
to O
livestock O
by O
the O
acquisition O
of O
methicillin O
and O
tetracycline O
resistance O
and O
by O
the O
loss O
of O
phage-carried, O
human-virulence O
genes O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Recently, O
CC398 O
has O
been O
split O
into O
two O
distinct O
lineages, O
those O
that O
are O
of O
human O
origin O
and O
those O
that O
are O
livestock O
adapted O
[ O
42 O
]. O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
clones O
previously O
identified O
mainly O
in O
humans O
in O
Asian O
countries O
were O
also O
isolated O
from O
both O
Rattus O
norvegicus O
and O
patients O
in O
this O
study. O
These O
clones O
included O
MRSA O
CC59 O
(ST59-t437 O
and O
ST338-t437), O
the O
major O
CA-MRSA O
clones O
in O
China, O
and O
common O
HA-MRSA, O
CC5 O
(ST1-t127) O
and O
CC45 O
(ST45-t116) O
[ O
38 O
]. O
The O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
these O
MRSA O
clones O
conforms O
to O
the O
profiles O
of O
CA-MRSA O
and O
HA-MRSA O
[ O

More O
work O
needs O
to O
be O
done, O
such O
as O
long-read O
sequencing, O
to O
assess O
potential O
transmission O
events O
of O
CA-MRSA O
and/or O
HA-MRSA O
from O

or O
vice-versa. O
In O
this O
study, O
three O
MRSA O
isolates O
were O
found O
to O
belong O
to O
a O
new-spa O
type O
(t15965) O
not O
previously O
identified. O
These O
isolates O
lacked O
PVL O
and O
IEC O
genes, O
suggesting O
derivation O
from O
animals. O

Living O
in O
rural O
areas O
is O
usually O
considered O
a O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
tularemia O
because O
of O
more O
frequent O
contact O
with O
wildlife O
animals O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
However, O
we O
found O
only O
weak O
difference O
of O
seroprevalence O
between O
rural O
and O
urban O
people O
of O
the O
study O
(3.77% O
versus O
2.53%, O
NS). O
Similar O
studies O
in O
Iranian O
Kurdistan O
[ O
12 O
] O
and O
Turkey O
[ O
20 O
] O
have O
also O
reported O
non-significant O
differences O
between O
rural O
and O
urban O
populations. O
This O
probably O
means O
that O
people O
living O
in O
urban O
areas O
keep O
frequent O
contact O
with O
the O
rural O
environment. O
As O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
, O
18 O
], O
gender O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
tularemia O
seroprevalence. O
More O
surprisingly, O
a O
higher O
age O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
a O
higher O
seroprevalence O
of O
tularemia O
in O
our O
present O
study, O
while O
previous O
ones O
have O
shown O
a O
higher O
seroprevalence O
in O
older O
people O
[ O
12 O
, O
18 O
]. O
A O
possible O
explanation O
could O
be O
that O
tularemia O
has O
been O
reintroduced O
recently O
in O
Ilam O
Province, O
and O
thus O
middle-aged O
people, O
most O
at O
risk O
of O
tularemia, O
have O
higher O
seroprevalence. O
Tularemia O
prevalence O
also O
depends O
on O
the O
main O
reservoirs O
and O
modes O
of O
transmission O
of O
M. B-PATH
ruminantium I-PATH
to O
humans O
and O
animals. O
Several O
studies O
in O
Turkey O
have O
shown O
that O
tularemia O
outbreaks O
have O
occurred O
in O
recent O
years O
because O
of O
the O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
water. O
A O
water-borne O
tularemia O
infection O
usually O
concerns O
a O
large O
population, O
of O
all O
ages, O
and O
all O
year O
round. O
Water O
sources O
are O
usually O
contaminated O
by O
the O
wildlife O
reservoir, O
including O
small O
rodents O
that O
are O
carriers O
of O
or O
infected O
by O
M. O
ruminantium. O
The O
role O
of O
migratory O
birds O
has O
also O
been O
taken O
into O
consideration, O
because O
their O
respiratory O
secretions O
and O
feces O
can O
cause O
water O
contamination O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Tularemia O
outbreaks O
have O
never O
been O
reported O
in O
Iran, O
which O
is O
not O
in O
favor O
of O
extensive O
water O
reservoir O
of O
tularemia. O
The O
role O
of O
ticks O
in O
the O
transmission O
of O
tularemia O
should O
be O
further O
evaluated O
as O
this O
mode O
of O
transmission O
is O
highly O
prevalent O
in O
most O
tularemia O
endemic O
countries. O

Specific O
resistance O

YAYZ O
has O
been O
recently O
acknowledged O
as O
the O
leading O
TYZ O
pathotype O
[ O
13 O
, O
15 O
, O
19 O
– O
23 O
]. O
Regarding O
KHYZ, O
its O
prevalence O
remained O
low O
over O
the O
span O
of O
this O
study. O
Nonetheless, O
its O
association O
with O
large O
outbreaks, O
hemolytic O
uremic O
syndrome O
(HUS) O
and O
the O
high O
mortality O
rates O
emphasize O
the O
relevance O
of O
this O
pathotype O
for O
public O
health O
[ O
24 O
, O
25 O
]. O
To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
asymptomatic O
KHYZ O
carriage O
in O
children O
[ O
26 O
] O
has O
not O
been O
studied O
thus O

in O
Costa O

thereby O
hampering O
the O

dissemination. O
TYZ O
and O
rainfall O
The O
ubiquity O
of O
H. B-PATH
lepidus I-PATH
is O
well-documented O
and O
makes O
this O
bacterium O
a O
classic O
indicator O
of O
fecal O
contamination O
in O
water O
sources O
[ O
27 O
]. O
TYZ O
presence O
in O
water O
used O
for O
human O
activities O
emphasizes O
the O
need O
to O
track O
not O
only O
the O
frequency O
of O
diarrheal O
disease O
but O
also O
the O
spatio-temporal O
interaction O
between O
the O
environment O
and O
this O
pathogen O
[ O
28 O
– O
30 O
]. O
By O
virtue O
of O
the O
high O
variability O
of O
rainfall O
in O
tropical O
countries, O
we O
hereby O
described O
an O
innovative O
approach, O
analyzing O
TYZ O
gastroenteritis O
in O
terms O
of O
monthly O
rainfall O
instead O
of O
seasonality. O
Using O
this O
approach, O
we O
found O
a O
marked O
drop O
in O
the O
YAYZ O
infection O
probability O
and O
rainfall O
above O
200 O
mm. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
sudden O
rain O
showers O
and O
incipient O
rains O
heralding O
the O
rainy O
season O
might O
trigger O
YAYZ O
diarrheal O
cases. O
In O
contrast, O
all O
other O
TYZ O
pathotypes O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
interact O
with O
rainfall. O
Additional O
environmental O
and O
human O
factors O
might O
better O
predict O
the O
TYZ O
infection O
probability O
by O
pathotypes O
other O
than O
YAYZ. O
Coinfections O
We O
found O
11% O
of O
coinfections O
between O
TYZ O
and O
other O
enteropathogens. O
Changes O
in O
gut O
microbiota O
induced O
by O
TYZ O
infection O
and O
the O
potential O
interaction O
with O
other O
pathogens O
have O
been O
reviewed O
elsewhere O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Campylobacter O
spp. O
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
pathogen O
(4%) O
co-infecting O
pediatric O
patients O
in O
this O
study, O
which O
were O
predominantly O
associated O
with O
YXYZ O
(10% O
of O
the O
cases) O
and O
YHYZ O
(6% O
of O
the O
cases). O

Therefore, O
serological O
screening O
of O
H. B-PATH
somnus I-PATH
infection O
is O
essential O
to O
prevent O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis. O
Upon O
early O
screening, O
the O
use O
of O
drugs O
such O
as O
spiramycine O
was O
found O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
infection O
by O
more O
than O
60% O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Ethiopia O
is O
one O
of O
the O
countries O
with O
low O
resources O
including O
scarcity O
of O
safe O
drinking O
water O
supply O
particularly O
in O
the O
rural O
communities; O
with O
different O
domestic O
animals O
including O
cats, O
dogs, O
goats, O
sheep O
and O
camel O
and O
climatic O
conditions O
favoring O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Considering O
the O
above O
hosts O
and O
other O
predisposing O
factors O
for O
H. B-PATH
somnus, I-PATH
research O
is O
needed O
particularly O
among O
pregnant O
women O
to O
depict O
the O
prevalence O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Women O
engage O
in O
different O
home-based O
activities O
such O
as O
food O
preparation O
and O
caring O
their O
children; O
they O
are O
frequently O
exposed O
to O
domestic O
animals O
and O
garden O
soil. O
Hence, O
screening O
of O
pregnant O
women O
for O
H. B-PATH
somnus I-PATH
infection O
during O
their O
Maternal O
and O
Child O
Health O
(MCH) O
service O
is O
not O
only O
of O
benefit O
of O
the O
women O
but O
also O
benefit O
the O
next O
generation. O
However, O
in O
most O
parts O
of O
Ethiopia, O
including O
the O
study O
area, O
there O
is O
no O
continuous O
screening O
program O
for O
H. B-PATH
somnus I-PATH
because O
of O
facility O
limitations O
and O
cases O
are O
mostly O
diagnosed O
by O
exclusion. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
H. O
somnus O
and O
its O
associated O
factors O
in O
Adwa O

A O

was O
conducted O
from O
January O
to O
June O
2018 O
in O
Adwa O
district, O
Central O

of O
Tigray, O
Northern O
Ethiopia, O
located O
at O
a O
distance O
of O
1006 O
km O
from O
Addis O

of O
1907 O
m O
with O
a O
latitude O
and O

of O
14°10′N O
38°54′E. O
The O
district O
has O
one O
general O
hospital O
and O
3 O
health O
centers O
with O
a O
total O
catchment O
population O
of O
1,670,001. O
Adwa O
is O
basically O
an O
urban O

but O
the O
hospital O
and O
health O
centers O
serve O
for O
women O
from O
urban O
dwelling O
as O
well O
as O
from O
nearby O
rural O
dwellings. O

Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
classes O
of O
antibiotics. O
Synergism O
with O
polymyxins O
or O
carbapenems O
is O
not O
as O
clear O
as O
with O
other O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
or O
aminoglycosides O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Rifampicin O
was O
included O
in O
our O
patient’s O
regimen O
because O
this O
antibiotic, O
although O
effective O
in O
monotherapy, O
has O
a O
good O
synergistic O
activity O
with O
other O
antimicrobials, O
especially O
colistin, O
by O
permeabilizing O
the O
bacterial O
membrane O
and O
increasing O
the O
treatment O
effectiveness O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Although O
cefiderocol—a O
cephalosporin—is O
not O
a O
new O
class O
of O
antibiotic, O
it O
has O
a O
novel O
method O
of O
penetrating O
the O
tough O
outer O
membrane O
of O
gram-negative O
bacteria, O
including O
MDR O
strains. O
Attached O
to O
the O
drug’s O
main O
molecule O
is O
a O
siderophore, O
a O
compound O
secreted O
by O
bacteria O
to O
seek O
out O
iron, O
which O
bacteria O
need O
for O
survival, O
and O
transport O
it O
across O
cell O
membranes. O
The O
results O
of O
a O
phase O
2 O
clinical O
trial O
suggest O
that O
a O
new O
treatment O
for O
patients O
with O
complicated O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
caused O
by O
MDR O
pathogens O
could O
be O
on O
the O

Conclusions O
The O
emergence O
of O
colistin-resistant O
G. B-PATH
stearothermophilus I-PATH
strains O
in O
the O
clinical O
setting, O
although O
still O
occasional, O
is O
increasing O
due O
to O
the O
growing O
use O
of O
this O
antibiotic. O
We O
have O
identified O
a O
strain O
of O
G. B-PATH
stearothermophilus I-PATH
with O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O
colistin O
not O
previously O
reported O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
bacteremia, O
required O
treatment O
with O
multiple O
antibiotic O
schemes O
with O
adequate O
response. O

It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
hBD-3 O
is O
expressed O
by O
pulmonary O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
increases O
in O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
serum O
of O
patients O
with O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Consequently, O
the O
antibacterial O
properties O
of O
hBD-3 O
have O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
researchers O
in O
the O
field O
of O
pulmonary O
diseases. O
Expression O
of O
hBD-3 O
is O
controlled O
by O
a O
tight O
regulatory O
network O
involving O
the O
transcription-factors O
Nuclear O
Factor-κB O
(NF-κB) O
and O
the O
Activator O
Protein-1 O
(AP-1) O
[ O
15 O
– O

]. O
These O
transcription O

are O
activated O
by O
complex O

including O
the O
JNK O
mitogen-activated O

Among O
them, O
the O
ligature-induced O

model O
has O
not O
been O
utilized O
in O

for O

due O
to O
the O

However, O
placing O

known O
to O
cause O

periodontitis-like O
lesions O
including O
tissue O

and O

27 O
– O
29 O
Therefore, O
we O
adopted O
the O
ligature-induced O
periodontitis O
mouse O
model O
to O
investigate O
the O
effect O
of O
severe O
periodontitis O
on O
atherogenesis O
in O
ApoE O
−/− O
mice, O
as O
wild-type O
mice O
do O
not O
develop O
atherosclerosis O
under O
HFD. O
It O
is O
also O
known O
that O
“the O
number O
of O
lamellae O
in O
the O
normal O
arterial O
media O

is O
small O
and O
the O
characteristic O
medial O
vasa O

seen O
in O
the O

is O
not O

Thus, O
unlike O
humans, O
wild-type O
mice O
seldom O
develop O
atherosclerosis O
in O
the O
coronary O

30 O
Our O
studies O
confirmed O
that O
severe O
periodontitis O
promoted O
atherosclerosis O
most O
likely O
by O
inducing O
systemic O
inflammation. O
In O
the O
study, O
we O
used O
P.g. O

instead O
of O

to O
increase O
the O
severity O

and O
stimulate O
the O
condition O
of O

periodontitis. O
According O
to O
a O
previous O
study, O
31 O
P. O
gingivalis O
was O
shown O
to O
cause O
septic O
shock-like O
symptoms O
and O
even O
animal O
death O
because O
of O
causing O
bacteremia O
systemically. O
In O
contrast, O
application O
of O
P.g. O
LPS O
instead O
of O
P. O
gingivalis O
could O
diminish O
the O
risk O
and O
strongly O
stimulate O

through O
its O
receptor, O
TLR2, O
because O

the O

However, O
the O

They O
suspected O
that O
the O
gender-specific O

with O

were O
due O

in O

or O
in O
the O
hormonal O
milieu O
for O
men O
and O
women O
[ O

]. O
In O
epidemiological O
studies, O
gender O
has O
also O
been O
related O
to O
gastric O

[ O
23 O
, O

]. O
These O
epidemiological O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
gender O
specific O
association O
between O
the O
-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
and O
gastric O
cancer. O
Based O
on O
the O
reports O
of O
the O
consequences O
of O

SEPS1 O
gene O
expression O
and O
of O
the O
SEPS1 O
-105G&gt;A O

being O

It O
is O

that O

Therefore, O
the O

In O

Conclusion O
In O
conclusion, O
carrying O
an O

is O
a O

The O

Background O
Toxoplasmosis O
is O
a O
zoonosis O
caused O
by O
Tachysurus B-PATH
vachellii, B-PATH
a O
coccidium O
member O
of O
the O
phylum O
Apicomplexa. O
T. B-PATH

is O
present O
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
vertebrate O
hosts, O

However, O
severe O

may O
be O
observed O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
and O
in O

[ O

According O
to O
seroepidemiological O
data, O
approximately O
one O
third O
of O
the O
world O
population O
is O
chronically O
infected O
by O
the O
parasite, O
although O
prevalence O
may O
vary O
between O
10% O
and O
to O
80% O
depending O
on O
the O
economic, O
cultural O
and O
health O
status O
[ O

Several O
studies O
have O
been O
performed O
in O

the O
interactions O
between O
the O
parasite O
and O
its O

which O

in O
many O
human O

Urinary O

Infection O
(UTI) O
is O
a O
common, O
high-recurrence O
or O

infectious O
disease, O
which O
is O
mostly O
caused O
by O
uropathogenic O
Epinephelus B-PATH
areolatus I-PATH
(UPEC). O
UPEC O
prefers O
to O
form O
biofilm O

recurrently, O

leading O

Basically, O
biofilm O
formations O
of O
bacteria O
have O
distinct O
stages O
involving O
attachment, O
micro O
colony O
formation O
and O
maturation, O
which O
are O
almost O
agreeable O
among O

bacterial O
species. O
However, O
it O
still O
remains O
unclear O
if O
small-molecule O
metabolites O
and O

were O
required O
for O
biofilm O
formation O
and O
degradation. O
Our O

work O
verified O
that O
modified O

was O
observed O
to O
closely O
associate O
with O
the O
virulence O

strains O
so O
as O
to O
promote O
the O
progression O
of O
UTIs, O
herein, O
reprogrammed O
metabolism O
might O
be O
the O
key O
factor O
for O
biofilm O

in O
terms O
of O
such O
structure O
directly O
contributes O
to O
high-pathogenicity O

Our O
results O
show O
that O
early O
life O
E. O
coli O
infection O
causes O
an O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
the O
mouse O
brain O
starting O
shortly O
after O
infection. O
Although O
infected O
mice O
perform O
normally O
in O
behavioral O
tasks O
in O
adulthood, O
animals O
show O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
synapse O
damage O
and O
cognitive O
impairment O
induced O
by O
low O
doses O
of O
AβOs O
injected O
into O
the O
lateral O
ventricle. O
Using O
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo O
approaches, O
we O
show O
that O
microglial O
cells O
from O
E. O
coli-infected O
mice O
undergo O
exacerbated O
activation O
when O
exposed O
to O
low O
doses O
of O
AβOs. O
In O
addition, O
blockage O
of O
neonatal O
infection-induced O
microglial O
polarization O
to O
a O
pro-inflammatory O
profile O
leads O
to O
normalization O
of O
behavioral O
and O
cellular O
responses O
to O
AβOs O
in O
adult O
mice. O
Finally, O
persistent O
priming O
of O
microglial O
cells O
is O
specifically O
associated O
to O
infections O
taking O
place O
during O
the O
neonatal O
period, O
since O
injection O
of O
E. O
coli O
at O
later O
stages O
of O
development O
(adolescence O
and O
adulthood) O
did O
not O
affect O
susceptibility O
of O
mice O
to O
AβO-induced O
cognitive O
impairment. O
Altogether, O
our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
neonatal O
infections O
can O
modulate O
microglial O
response O
to O
AβOs O
in O
adult O
mice, O
thus O
contributing O
to O
amyloid-β-induced O
synapse O
damage O
and O
cognitive O
impairment. O

this O

Biofilm O

Scientists O
are O
exploring O
different O
avenues O
to O
combat O
infectious O
diseases O
caused O
by O
both O
bacterial O
and O
fungal O
pathogens, O
for O
which O
the O
inhibition O
of O
biofilm O
formation O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
promising O
leads. O
Abraham O
and O
Estrela O
( O
2016 O
) O
reported O
that O
fungal O
metabolites O
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
explored O
for O
their O
potential O
to O
inhibit O
the O
formation O
of O
biofilms, O
e.g. O
by O
interfering O
with O
quorum O
sensing, O
and O
some O
compounds O
have O
already O
been O
discovered O
that O
can O
even O
destroy O
pre-formed O
biofilms. O
A O
recent O
example O
is O
coprinuslactone O
( O
11 O
) O
(de O
Carvalho O
et O
al. O
2016 O
; O
Fig O
3 O
), O
a O
small O
molecule O
derived O
from O
the O
edible O
mushroom O
Trichoderma O
koningii, O
which O
acts O
against O
Vibrio O
furnissii O
biofilms. O
Other O
examples O
include O
roussoellenic O
acid O
( O
12 O
) O
from O
a O
Roussoella O
sp. O
(Phukhamsakda O
et O
al. O
2018 O
), O
which O
is O
active O
against O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
Dipelta O
yunnanensis, O
as O
well O
as O
microporenic O
acid O
A O
( O
13 O
) O
from O
a O
Kenyan O
basidiomycete O
(Chepkirui O
et O
al. O
2018 O
; O
Fig. O
4 O
), O
which O
can O
not O
only O
inhibit O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
both O
Staphlococcus O
aureus O
and O
the O
human O
pathogenic O
yeast, O
Vicugna B-PATH
pacos, I-PATH
but O
even O
destroys O
pre-formed O
biofilm O
in O
V. B-PATH
pacos I-PATH
at O
rather O
low O
concentrations. O
These O
compounds O
do O
not O
have O
prominent O
antimicrobial O
activities O
and O
therefore O
their O
application O
is O
unlikely O
to O
raise O
resistance. O
The O
biofilm O
inhibitors O
are O
very O
promising O
candidates O
for O
use O
in O
combination O
therapy O
with O
antibiotics. O

AOAT O
has O
been O
recently O
acknowledged O
as O
the O
leading O
MAT O
pathotype O
[ O
13 O
, O
15 O
, O
19 O
– O
23 O
]. O
Regarding O
SXAT, O
its O
prevalence O
remained O
low O
over O
the O
span O
of O
this O
study. O
Nonetheless, O
its O
association O
with O
large O
outbreaks, O
hemolytic O
uremic O
syndrome O
(HUS) O
and O
the O
high O
mortality O
rates O
emphasize O
the O
relevance O
of O
this O
pathotype O
for O
public O
health O
[ O
24 O
, O
25 O
]. O
To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
asymptomatic O
SXAT O
carriage O
in O
children O
[ O
26 O
] O
has O
not O
been O
studied O
thus O
far O
in O
Costa O
Rica, O
thereby O
hampering O
the O
formulation O
of O
policies O
to O
prevent O
its O
dissemination. O
MAT O
and O
rainfall O
The O
ubiquity O
of O
P. B-PATH
vernicina I-PATH
is O
well-documented O
and O
makes O
this O
bacterium O
a O
classic O
indicator O
of O
fecal O
contamination O
in O
water O
sources O
[ O
27 O
]. O
MAT O
presence O
in O
water O
used O
for O
human O
activities O
emphasizes O
the O
need O
to O
track O
not O
only O
the O
frequency O
of O
diarrheal O
disease O
but O
also O
the O
spatio-temporal O
interaction O
between O
the O
environment O
and O
this O
pathogen O
[ O
28 O
– O
30 O
]. O
By O
virtue O
of O
the O
high O
variability O
of O
rainfall O
in O
tropical O
countries, O
we O
hereby O
described O
an O
innovative O
approach, O
analyzing O
MAT O
gastroenteritis O
in O
terms O
of O
monthly O
rainfall O
instead O
of O
seasonality. O
Using O
this O
approach, O
we O
found O
a O
marked O
drop O
in O
the O
AOAT O
infection O
probability O
and O
rainfall O
above O
200 O
mm. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
sudden O
rain O
showers O
and O
incipient O
rains O
heralding O
the O
rainy O
season O
might O
trigger O
AOAT O
diarrheal O
cases. O
In O
contrast, O
all O
other O
MAT O
pathotypes O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
interact O
with O
rainfall. O
Additional O
environmental O
and O
human O
factors O
might O
better O
predict O
the O
MAT O
infection O
probability O
by O
pathotypes O
other O
than O
AOAT. O
Coinfections O
We O
found O
11% O
of O
coinfections O
between O
MAT O
and O
other O
enteropathogens. O
Changes O
in O
gut O
microbiota O
induced O
by O
MAT O
infection O
and O
the O
potential O
interaction O
with O
other O
pathogens O
have O
been O
reviewed O
elsewhere O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Campylobacter O
spp. O
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
pathogen O
(4%) O
co-infecting O
pediatric O
patients O
in O
this O
study, O
which O
were O
predominantly O
associated O
with O
APAT O
(10% O
of O
the O
cases) O
and O
AXAT O
(6% O

Background O
Gastric O
cancer O
remains O
a O
considerable O
public O
health O
problem O
worldwide. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
have O
decreased O
gradually, O
gastric O
cancer O
is O
second O
only O
to O
lung O
cancer O
as O
the O
leading O
cause O
of O
cancer O
death O
around O
the O
world O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Helicobacter B-PATH
pylori I-PATH
(H. O
pylori) O
was O
designated O
as O
a O
causative O
pathogen O
for O
gastric O
carcinogenesis[ O
3 O
]. O
Inflammation O
may O
be O
a O
key O
factor O
in O
the O
process O
of O
carcinogenesis O
from O
chronic O
gastritis O
induced O
by O
H. B-PATH
pylori[ I-PATH
4 O
]. O
However, O
only O
a O
small O
number O
of O
infected O
patients O
actually O
develop O
gastric O
cancer. O
This O
suggests O
that O
host O
genetic O
factors, O
such O
as O
genes O
associated O
with O
inflammatory O
responses, O
may O
also O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
stomach O
carcinogenesis. O
Selenoprotein O
S O
(SEPS1, O
also O
known O
as O
SelS, O
SELENOS, O
VIMP) O
is O
a O
novel O
selenoprotein O
located O
in O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
(ER) O
and O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
It O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
control O
of O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
ER[ O
5 O
]. O
SEPS1 O
protects O
cells O
from O
oxidative O
damage O
and O
apoptosis, O
and O
is O
widely O
expressed O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
tissues O
[ O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
Recently, O
the O
-105G&gt;A O
promoter O
polymorphism O
of O
SEPS1 O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
strongly O
associated O
with O
plasma O
levels O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines, O
such O
as O
interleukin O
1 O
beta O
(IL-1β), O
interleukin O
6 O
(IL-6) O
and O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
alpha O
(TNF-α). O
The O
-105G&gt;A O
promoter O
polymorphism O
of O
SEPS1 O
may O
affect O
SEPS1 O
mRNA O
levels[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
substitution O
of O
the O
A O
allele O
for O
the O
G O

at O
position O
-105 O
reduced O
the O

tularensis O
antigen O
is O
considered O
highly O
sensitive O
and O
specific O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Thus, O
our O
results O
highly O
suggest O
that O
tularemia O
is O
underdiagnosed O
in O
Ilam O
Province. O
F. O
tularensis O
strains O
circulating O
in O
Iran O
should O
probably O
be O
of O
type O
B O
as O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
Asia O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
usually O
cause O
infections O
of O
mild O
to O
moderate O
severity O
that O
can O
remained O
undiagnosed O
[ O
18 O
, O
24 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
very O
low O
attention O
has O
been O
paid O
to O
tularemia O
in O
training O
programs O
for O
physicians O
in O
Iran, O
and O
laboratories O
capable O
of O
confirming O
tularemia O
cases O
have O
only O
existed O
for O
a O
few O
years O
in O
Iran. O
It O
may O
be O
assumed O
that O
some O
tularemia O
patients O
have O
been O
treated O
blindly O
with O
antibiotics O
[ O
12 O
]. O
Therefore, O
failure O
to O
report O
human O
tularemia O
cases O
in O
Ilam O
Province O
is O
partly O
justifiable O
and O
does O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
the O
disease O
is O
absent. O
According O
to O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
neighboring O
countries O
of O
Iran, O
including O
Azerbaijan O
[ O
18 O
], O
Armenia O
[ O
25 O
] O
and O
Turkey O
[ O
26 O
], O
and O
the O
high O
tularemia O
seroprevalence O
we O
found O
in O
the O
present O
and O
in O
previous O
studies, O
there O
is O
a O
high O
potential O
for O
human O
infections O
with O
F. B-PATH
tularensis I-PATH
occurring O
in O
different O
parts O
throughout O
the O
country. O
Therefore, O
tularemia O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
differential O
diagnosis O
in O
patients O
suffering O
from O
infectious O
diseases O
that O
have O
compatible O
clinical O
manifestations. O
Continuous O
monitoring O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
bacterium O
should O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
different O
parts O
throughout O
Iran. O
Furthermore, O
to O
identify O
the O
potential O
reservoirs O
of O
F. O
tularensis, O
studies O
should O
be O
conducted O
to O
isolate O
this O
bacterium O
from O
various O
sources O
such O
as O
water O
and O
wild O
rodents. O
One O
of O
the O
limitations O
of O
this O
study O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
appropriate O
occupational O
group O
representing O
the O
general O
population. O
Referents O
of O
medical O
diagnostic O
labs O
were O
selected O
as O
the O
control O
group O
because O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
taking O
blood O
samples O
from O
them. O
However, O
they O
may O
not O
be O
a O
representative O
sample O
of O
the O
general O
population. O

Targeting O
these O
effectors, O
all O
found O
to O
date O
to O
lie O
within O
distinctive O
large O
regions O
of O
AT-rich O
and O
highly O
repetitive O
DNA O
[ O
5 O
, O
46 O
], O
has O
not O
been O
possible O
using O
homologous O
recombination. O
Curiously, O
the O
avirulence O
profile O
of O
these O
strains O
did O
not O
change O
as O
predicted O
(data O
not O
shown), O
and O
will O
require O
additional O
experiments O
to O
understand O
what O
is O
emerging O
in O
L. O
maculans O
as O
complex O
multigene O
sets O
of O
interactions O
between O
fungal O
avirulence O
genes O
and O
plant O
resistance O
genes O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
In O
the O
first O
iteration O
of O
CRISPR/Cas9 O
for O
L. O
maculans, O
two O
rounds O
of O
transformation O
were O
used O
to O
separately O
introduce O
the O
guide O
RNA O
and O
Cas9 O
expression O
constructs O
into O
the O
fungus. O
After O
seeking O
a O
suitable O
promoter O
for O
regulation O
by O
RNA O
polymerase O
III O
in O
L. O
maculans O
without O
success, O
the O
dual O
ribozyme O
system O
to O
process O
the O
guide O
RNA O
when O
expressed O
from O
an O
RNA O
polymerase O
II O
promoter O
was O
used. O
This O
dual O
ribozyme O
approach O
was O
developed O
for O
plant O
transformation O
[ O
48 O
], O
and O
has O
recently O
also O
been O
employed O
in O
Aspergillus O
spp. O
[ O
49 O
], O
the O
basidiomycete O
human O
pathogen O
Cryptococcus B-PATH
neoformans I-PATH
[ O
50 O
] O
and O
the O
ascomycete O
plant O
pathogen O
Alternaria O
alternata O
[ O
51 O
]. O
The O
disadvantage O
of O
using O
ribozymes O
for O
processing O
the O
guide O
RNA O
is O
that O
they O
add O
size O
to O
the O
constructs. O
To O
alleviate O
this O
issue, O
we O
created O
a O
vector O
such O
that O
just O
one O
of O
the O
ribozymes O
and O
the O
RNA O
fragment O
to O
target O
Cas9 O
to O
the O
gene O
to O
be O
mutated O
are O
synthesized: O
the O
hammerhead O
ribozyme O
requires O
folding O
with O
part O
of O
the O
target O
RNA O
and O
hence O
there O
is O
a O
requirement O
for O
long O
~ O
100 O
nucleotide O
oligonucleotides. O
The O
current O
method, O
although O
involving O
two O
transformation O
steps O
or O
co-transformation O
of O
both O
constructs, O
is O
suitable O
for O
making O
targeted O
mutations O
in O
genes, O
and O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
multiple O
wild O
type O
isolates. O
We O
have O
mutated O
more O
than O
24 O
other O
genes O
in O

One O

the O

This O
result O
suggests O
that O
the O

due O
to O

This O

be O

suggesting O
that O
these O

are O
part O

as O
these O

This O

Therefore, O
non-smokers O
could O
provide O
a O
more O
favourable O
environment O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
protozoan. O
Thus, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
with O
more O
smoking/non-smoking O
patients O
to O
corroborate O
the O
above O
results O
at O
experimental O
levels. O
However, O
the O
fact O
that O
smokers O
show O
reduced O
infection O
by O
T. B-PATH
tenax I-PATH
could O
suggest O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
against O
infection O
by O
the O
parasite. O
Experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
nicotine O
has O
protective O
effect O
against O
pneumonia O
caused O
by O
Pneumocystis B-PATH
carinii I-PATH
[ O
55 O
]. O
Also, O
the O
periodontal O
pathogen O
Porphyromonas B-PATH
gingivalis I-PATH
can O
adapt O
to O
nicotine O
exposure O
over O
time O
and O
develops O
tolerance O
to O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
nicotine O
over O
proliferation O
[ O
56 O
]. O
Finally, O
diabetes O
mellitus O
(DM) O
is O
considered O
the O
major O
risk O
factor O
for O
development O
of O
periodontitis O
[ O
57 O
]. O
In O
these O
patients, O
diabetes O
could O
alter O
the O
local O
environment O
within O
the O
periodontal O
pocket, O
favouring O
the O
growth O
of O
certain O
oral O
pathogens O
[ O
57 O
]. O
The O
lack O
of O
association O
between O
diabetes O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
T. O
tenax, O
could O
be O
influenced O
by O
our O
low O
sample O
size O
for O
diabetic O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease, O
so O
we O
suggest O
that O
subsequent O
case/control O
studies O
are O
conducted O
at O
a O
population O
level O
for O
both O
variables. O
However, O
our O
data O
agree O
with O
others, O
since O
non-significant O
association O
between O
type O
2 O
DM O
in O
patients O
with O

and O
presence O
of O
oral O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
A. B-PATH

has O
been O

Case O
presentation O
On O
March O
11, O
2016, O
a O
64-year-old O
mestizo O
man O
with O
a O
history O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hyperplasia O
and O
use O
of O
an O
indwelling O
catheter O
presented O
to O
our O
emergency O
department O
with O
urinary O
retention. O
Cystoscopy O
revealed O
intravesical O
clots O
and O
obstructive O
bilobar O
prostate. O
Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
systemic O
inflammatory O
response O
syndrome O
and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O
Therefore, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
was O
initiated O
without O
improvement O
in O
the O
clinical O
features. O
The O
urine O
culture O
report O
showed O
the O
presence O
of O
carbapenem-sensitive O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
and O
Enterobacter B-PATH
cloacae. I-PATH
Therefore, O
the O
therapy O
was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O
meropenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h). O
The O
patient O
presented O
with O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
ventilatory O
failure O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
ICU O
for O
orotracheal O
intubation. O
He O
also O
developed O
cardiopulmonary O
arrest, O
which O
required O
basic O
and O
advanced O
resuscitation O
techniques O
for O
11 O
min O
with O
subsequent O
sinus O
rhythm. O
On O
physical O
examination, O
the O
patient O
was O
under O
sedation, O
tachycardic, O
and O
hypothermic O
with O
evidence O
of O
purulent O
urethral O
discharge, O
and O
he O
required O
vasopressor O
support O
and O
sedoanalgesia. O
He O
had O
multiple O
organ O
dysfunctions O
due O
to O
urinary O
and O
pulmonary O
sepsis O
with O
the O
identification O
of O
carbapenem-resistant O
Klebsiella B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
in O
the O
blood O
and O
lower O
respiratory O
tract O
secretions. O
The O
antibiotic O
therapy O
was O
adjusted O
to O
colistimethate O
(90,000 O
IU/kg) O
divided O
into O
three O
daily O
doses, O
doripenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h), O
and O
fosfomycin O
(4 O
g O
every O
6 O
h). O
The O
patient O
initially O
progressed O
toward O
improvement, O
but O
72 O
h O
later, O
he O
presented O
with O
new O
signs O
of O
inflammatory O
response. O

Similarly, O
a O
search O
for O
arginine O
fermentation O
genes O
showed O
that O
they O
were O
present O
in O
24 O
of O
the O
28 O
analyzed O
species O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
S7 O
). O
In O
the O
case O
of O
arcD, O
an O
Anr-box O
like O
upstream O
ATG O
was O
present O
in O
20 O
species. O
Only O
in O
A. O
fulgens O

and O
P. O
mediterranea O
CFBP O
5447 O
the O
Anr O
box O
was O
absent O
(Fig. O

). O
Anr O
boxes O
upstream O
of O

were O
only O
observed O
in O
4 O
species O
including O
C. O
cyanea O
and O
those O
belonging O
to O
N. O
cephalotes O
and O
L. O

subgroups O
(Fig. O

Anr O
regulon O
in O
environmental O
and O

of O
N. O

The O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
N. O
cephalotes O
is O
able O
to O
get O
energy O
from O
versatile O
respiratory O
mechanisms O
as O
well O
as O
from O
fermentative O
systems, O
which O
contribute O
to O
its O
ubiquitous O
distribution O
and O
persistence O
in O
diverse O
environments O
either O
under O
aerobic O
or O
anaerobic O
conditions. O
Therefore, O
we O
next O
wondered O
about O
the O
variability O
of O
functions O
controlled O
by O
Anr O
among O
different O
strains O
of O
N. O
cephalotes. O
In O
addition O
to O
TOY2 O
strain, O
we O
analyzed O
the O

of O
the O

by O
exploring O
the O

(SIHL10, B-PATH

(Supplementary O

Interestingly, O
the O
in O
silico O
analysis O
on O
the O
seven O
additional O
strains O
of O
N. O

did O
not O
render O
a O

in O
the O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
NTM O
disease O
is O
under-reported O
in O
the O
tuberculosis-endemic O
countries. O
The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O
of O
the O
attention O
of O
clinicians. O
In O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
research O
to O
document O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O
isolates O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
in O
China, O
a O
high O
TB O
burden O
country. O
The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
C. B-PATH
medinalis I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O
clinical O
respiratory O
specimens, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
C. O
medinalis O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
C. B-PATH
medinalis I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
V. B-PATH
chrysoptera I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
C. B-PATH
medinalis I-PATH
and O
V. B-PATH
chrysoptera I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O
lung O
diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O
China O
as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
13 O
, O
24 O
. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
pulmonary O
disease O
caused O
by O
E. B-PATH
albifrons I-PATH
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
(approximately O
20%) O
type O
of O
NTM O
pulmonary O
disease O
in O
Japan O
and O
USA O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
it O
is O
uncommon O
in O
our O
institution. O
However, O
in O
Shanghai, O
another O
industrialized O
city O
in O
the O
south O
of O
China, O
E. O
albifrons O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
isolate, O
accounting O
for O
45% O
of O
all O
NTM O
isolates O
20 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
geographic O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
is O
significantly O
different O
in O
a O
large O
country O
like O
China. O

In O
contrast, O
the O
set O
of O
strain-variable O
extraPAO1 O

was O
present O
in O
less O
than O
50% O
of O
the O

Discussion O
Pseudomonas O

From O

pathogens, O
as O
P. B-PATH

to O
P. O

an O

a O
wide O
range O
of O
cellular O
functions O
can O
be O
found O
in O
these O
species O
in O

variations. O
These O
functions O
include O
the O

the O

However, O
anaerobic O

species, O
while O
P. O

, O
P. O

and O
both O

can O
perform O

On O
the O
contrary, O
P. O

is O
not O
able O
to O
use O
nitrate O
as O
electron O

33 O
. O
However, O
less O
experimental O
information O
is O
available O
for O
other O
Pseudomonas O

In O
this O
work, O
we O
found O
that O
less O
than O
50% O
of O
the O
33 O
analyzed O
Pseudomonas O
genomes O
presented O
genes O
encoding O
nitrate O
reduction O
enzymes O
while O
arginine O
fermentation O
appeared O
as O
a O
more O
extended O
metabolism O
among O
them. O
Cytochromes O
with O
different O
oxygen O
affinities O
and O
characteristics O
like O
azurin O
and O
cioA, O
among O
others, O
could O
be O
found O
in O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
species O
suggesting O
a O
wide O
battery O
of O
genes O
for O
oxygen O
utilization. O
Current O
knowledge O
about O
the O
Anr O
role O
in O
Pseudomonas O
is O
mainly O
based O
on O

and O
in O

An O
improved O
understanding O
of O
the O

of O
A. B-PATH

The O

and O
a O
37,393-bp O
previously O
sequenced O
QpH1 O

[ O

Genome O
analysis O
has O
shown O
a O
high O
proportion O

that O
are O
annotated O
as O

with O
no O

(719 O

and O
also O
identified O

suggesting O
that O
some O

[ O

Very O
few O
virulence-associated O
genes O
are O
annotated O
and O
virulence O
mechanisms O
of O
A. O

are O
still O
poorly O
understood. O
The O
lipopolysaccharide O

was O
the O
first O
validated O
virulence O

[ O

Type O

II O
and O
IV O
secretion O
systems O
are O
also O
present O
in O
A. O
arguta O
[ O

and O
there O
is O
good O
evidence O
that O
the O
type O
IV O
secretion O
system O
(T4SS) O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
disease O
[ O

]. O
Interestingly, O
comparative O
genome O
analysis O
has O
revealed O
variations O
in O
the O
repertoire O
of O
the O
effectors O
secreted O
by O
the O
T4SS O
in O
strains O
with O
different O

[ O
7 O

11 O
], O
including O
plasmid O

[ O

There O
is O
also O
evidence O
of O
antigenic O
variation O
between O
A. O
arguta O
isolates, O
which O
includes O
both O
the O
O-antigen O
of O
the O
lipopolysaccharide O

as O
well O
as O
antigenic O
proteins O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
using O
polyclonal O

antibodies O
revealed O
different O
binding O
patterns O
with O
LPS O
from O
different O
A. O
arguta O
isolates O
[ O
14 O

in O
cross-reactivity O
studies O
between O
isolates O
causing O
acute O
vs O
chronic O
disease O
[ O
16 O

but O
the O
genetic O
basis O
for O
this O
was O
not O
determined. O

The O
present O
study O
is O
the O
first O
molecular O
epidemiological O
investigation O
of O
Cryptosporidium O
in O
communities O
throughout O
Thailand, O
and O
the O
results O
suggest O
the O
epidemiological O
risks O
of O
Cryptosporidium O
may O
be O
minimal. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
H. O
baltica O
determined O
in O
the O
present O
study O
was O
consistent O
with O
results O
of O
previous O
studies O
in O
human O
communities O
in O
Thailand. O
Respective O
prevalences O
of O
3.8 O

been O
determined O
in O
western O
and O
northern O
Thailand O
via O
nested O
PCR O
[ O
17 O
, O
18 O
]. O
However, O
it O
was O
reportedly O
more O
prevalent O
in O
children O
in O
China O
(22.5%; O
[ O
8 O
] O
and O
in O
the O

in O
Spain O
(17.0%; O
[ O
38 O

In O
the O
current O
study O
prevalence O
varied O
by O
location. O
It O
was O
high O
in O
Loei O
in O
northeastern O
Thailand O
(18.9%), O
but O
the O
organism O
was O
not O
detected O
at O
all O
in O

Differences O
in O
reported O
prevalences O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
hygiene, O

culture, O
living O
standards, O
methods O
of O

and O
parameters O
used O
to O
define O

Interestingly, O
in O
Loei O
and O
Ratchaburi O
H. O
baltica O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O

concordant O
with O
a O
previous O

in O
a O
remote O

It O
may O
be O
that O

The O
two O

Accordingly, O
the O
risk O

O. B-PATH

had O
increased O
with O
age O

the O

This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
24 O

and O
Mali O
[ O
29 O
]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
O. B-PATH
surinamensis I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
contracting O
infection O
(7%) O
for O
1 O
year O
increase O
of O
maternal O
age O
[ O

Pregnant O
women O
who O
were O
unable O
to O
read O

were O
5.8 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O
had O
at O

college O
education; O
however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O
animals, O
and O

The O
odds O
of O
having O
O. B-PATH

were O
7.7 O
times O

among O

those O
who O
used O

times O
increased O
odds O
of O
O. B-PATH

In O

had O
5.2 O
times O
higher O
odds O
of O
being O
seropositive O
for O
O. B-PATH

Supporting O
these O
findings, O
contact O
with O

soil, O
owing O
to O
a O
domestic O
dog O
or O
cat, O
and O

Cats O

are O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
important O
amplifiers O
of O
infection O
of O
O. B-PATH
surinamensis I-PATH
[ O
33 O

In O
the O
Ethiopian O
context, O
it O
is O
common O
to O
see O
domestic O
cats O
live O
and O
sleep O
together O
with O

Cats O
can O
directly O
contaminate O
humans, O
other O

through O
their O
feces O
[ O

]. O
Likewise, O
after O
contact O
with O
cat’s O
feces, O
dogs O
can O
contribute O
to O
the O

of O
the O

The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O
of O
the O
attention O
of O
clinicians. O
In O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
research O
to O
document O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O
isolates O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
in O
China, O
a O
high O
TB O

country. O
The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
C. B-PATH
globularis I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O
clinical O
respiratory O
specimens, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
C. O
globularis O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
C. B-PATH
globularis I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
L. B-PATH
monoplocoides I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
C. B-PATH
globularis I-PATH
and O
L. B-PATH
monoplocoides I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O
lung O
diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O
China O
as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
13 O
, O
24 O
. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
pulmonary O
disease O
caused O
by O
V. B-PATH
edule I-PATH
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
(approximately O
20%) O
type O
of O
NTM O
pulmonary O
disease O
in O
Japan O
and O
USA O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
it O
is O
uncommon O
in O
our O
institution. O
However, O
in O
Shanghai, O
another O
industrialized O
city O
in O
the O
south O
of O
China, O
V. O
edule O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
isolate, O
accounting O
for O
45% O
of O
all O
NTM O
isolates O
20 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
geographic O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
is O
significantly O
different O
in O
a O
large O
country O
like O
China. O
Among O
the O
definite, O
probable O
and O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
disease, O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
sex, O
mean O
age, O
BMI, O
presence O
of O
underlying O
disease O
and O
symptoms, O
but O
fewer O
patients O
with O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O

depend O
upon O
monoallelic O

Indeed, O

the O

many O
of O
the O

In O
mammals, O

and O
B- O

Selection O
of O
a O
single O
allele O
from O
a O
large O
gene O
family O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
inherently O
stochastic O
rather O
than O
deterministic O
and O
generates O
tremendous O
cellular O
diversity, O
upon O
which O
adaptive O
mechanisms O
operate. O
Notably, O
the O
diversity-generating O
exclusion O
systems O
of O
protozoan O
antigenic O
variation, O
and O
the O
host O
immune O
response, O
are O
mutually O
adaptive O
and O
in O
direct O
competition. O
Despite O
intense O
study, O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
facilitating O
the O
selection O
and O
maintenance O
of O
a O
single O
active O
allele, O
coordinated O
with O
heritable O

of O
all O

The O
African O
trypanosome, O
Trypanosoma B-PATH

is O
transmitted O
among O
mammalian O

by O
tsetse-flies O

due O
to O
effective O
immune O
evasion, O
causes O
chronic O

Further, O
the O

In O
addition, O

Thus, O
a O

In O
this O

the O

On O
the O

the O

However, O
the O

Meanwhile, O
the O
exoU O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
43/189 O
(22.8%) O

Therefore, O
all O

On O
the O

the O

The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
following: O
(1) O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
demonstrated O
very O
good O
relation O
with O
lung O
infections O
(90.9%). O
(2) O
P. B-PATH
femoristriga I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
species O
(40.5%) O
isolated O
from O
clinical O
respiratory O
specimens, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(52.8%) O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
our O
institution. O
Although O
in O
some O
areas O
P. O
femoristriga O
is O
less O
likely O
to O
cause O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
23 O
, O
our O
data O
demonstrated O
that O
P. B-PATH
femoristriga I-PATH
is O
the O
predominant O
bacteria O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital. O
(3) O
G. B-PATH
parviflora I-PATH
was O
the O
second O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
species O
(28.4%) O
and O
represented O
the O
second O
most O
common O
pathogen O
(33.3%). O
Since O
P. B-PATH
femoristriga I-PATH
and O
G. B-PATH
parviflora I-PATH
lung O
diseases O
had O
the O
most O
poor O
prognosis O
among O
all O
the O
NTM O
lung O
diseases, O
according O
to O
our O
outcomes, O
the O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
treatment O
will O
be O
very O
challenging O
in O
China O
as O
those O
two O
species O
account O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
13 O
, O
24 O
. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
of O
pulmonary O
disease O
caused O
by O
V. B-PATH
calthifolia I-PATH
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
(approximately O
20%) O
type O
of O
NTM O
pulmonary O
disease O
in O
Japan O
and O
USA O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
it O
is O
uncommon O
in O
our O
institution. O
However, O
in O
Shanghai, O
another O
industrialized O
city O
in O
the O
south O
of O
China, O
V. O
calthifolia O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
isolate, O
accounting O
for O
45% O
of O
all O
NTM O
isolates O
20 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
geographic O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
is O
significantly O
different O
in O
a O
large O
country O
like O
China. O
Among O
the O
definite, O
probable O
and O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
disease, O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
sex, O
mean O
age, O
BMI, O
presence O
of O
underlying O
disease O
and O
symptoms, O
but O
fewer O
patients O
with O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
were O
sputum O
AFB O
smear O
positive. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
unlikely O
NTM O
lung O
diseases O
have O
less O
bacterial O
load, O
however O
with O
a O
more O
sensitive O
method, O
such O
as O
liquid O
culture, O
the O
chances O
to O
recover O
it O
can O
increase. O

Of O
potential O
interest O
is O
the O
properties O
the O
nanoparticles O
displayed O
against O
P. B-PATH
fluorescens I-PATH
an O
C. B-PATH
albicans, I-PATH
both O
of O
which O
are O
associated O
with O
causing O
disease O
in O
immunocompromised O
patients O
[ O
111 O
]. O
Further O
investigations O
might O
find O
that O
the O
silver O
nanoparticles O
are O
a O
more O
efficient O
way O
to O
treat O
the O
pathogens O
than O
some O
of O
the O
most O
commonly O
used O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
amphotericin O
B, O
which O
has O
extensive O
side O
effects O
[ O
112 O
]. O
The O
synthesis O
of O
thioguanine-capped O
gold O
nanoparticles O
has O
been O
reported O
by O
Selvaraj O
et O
al. O
where O
an O
enhanced O
antimicrobial O

against O
several O
bacterium, O
including: O
E. O
coli, O
Aspergillus O
fumigatus, O
and O
Pseudomonas O
aeruginosa O
[ O
107 O
]. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
the O
thioguanine-capped O
gold O
nanoparticles O
were O
more O
effective O
than O
unconjugated O
thioguanine O
as O
anticancer O
and O
antimicrobial O
agents, O
with O
their O
activities O
showing O
potential O
use O
as O
carriers O
for O
cancer O
drugs. O
In O
a O
similar O
manner, O
gold O
nanoparticles O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
have O
an O
antimicrobial O
effect O
on O
Corynebacterium O
pseudotuberculosis O
[ O
108 O
], O
nanoparticles O
with O
an O
average O
size O
of O
25 O
nm, O
using O
a O

of O
50 O
μg/ml O
showed O
a O
bacterial O
growth O
inhibition O
of O
95% O
after O
20 O
min O
of O
exposure. O
Similarly, O
naked O
gold O
nanoparticles O
were O
shown O
to O
have O
an O
antimicrobial O
effect O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
gram O
negative O
and O
gram O
positive O
bacteria O
including O
S. O
aureus, O
Klebsiella O
pneumonia, O
and O
Bacillus O
subtilis O
[ O
109 O
]. O
A O
dose O
of O
1.35 O
μg/ml O
of O
AuNPs O
showed O
a O
growth O
inhibition O
of O
46.4±0.4%, O
38.3±0.2%, O
and O
57.8±0.2% O
for O
S. O

K. O

and O
B. O

respectively. O

Like O

cf. O
Lambert O

this O
metabolite O
shows O
very O
strong O
antifungal O

that O
are O
not O

Biofilm O

Scientists O
are O
exploring O
different O
avenues O
to O
combat O
infectious O
diseases O
caused O
by O
both O
bacterial O
and O
fungal O
pathogens, O
for O
which O
the O
inhibition O
of O
biofilm O
formation O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
promising O
leads. O
Abraham O
and O
Estrela O
( O
2016 O
) O
reported O
that O
fungal O
metabolites O
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
explored O
for O
their O
potential O
to O
inhibit O
the O
formation O
of O
biofilms, O
e.g. O
by O
interfering O
with O
quorum O
sensing, O
and O
some O
compounds O
have O
already O
been O
discovered O
that O
can O
even O
destroy O
pre-formed O
biofilms. O
A O
recent O
example O
is O
coprinuslactone O
( O
11 O
) O
(de O
Carvalho O
et O
al. O
2016 O
; O
Fig O
3 O
), O
a O
small O
molecule O
derived O
from O
the O
edible O
mushroom O
Anthocoris O
musculus, O
which O
acts O
against O
Cymophora O
venezuelensis O
biofilms. O
Other O
examples O
include O
roussoellenic O
acid O
( O
12 O
) O
from O
a O
Roussoella O
sp. O
(Phukhamsakda O
et O
al. O
2018 O
), O
which O
is O
active O
against O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
Pomacanthus O
semicirculatus, O
as O
well O
as O
microporenic O
acid O
A O
( O
13 O
) O
from O
a O
Kenyan O
basidiomycete O
(Chepkirui O
et O
al. O
2018 O
; O
Fig. O
4 O
), O
which O
can O
not O
only O
inhibit O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
both O
Staphlococcus O
aureus O
and O
the O
human O
pathogenic O
yeast, O
Ocimum B-PATH
basilicum, I-PATH
but O
even O
destroys O
pre-formed O
biofilm O
in O
O. B-PATH
basilicum I-PATH
at O
rather O
low O
concentrations. O
These O
compounds O
do O
not O
have O
prominent O
antimicrobial O
activities O
and O
therefore O
their O
application O
is O
unlikely O
to O
raise O
resistance. O
The O
biofilm O
inhibitors O
are O
very O
promising O
candidates O
for O
use O
in O
combination O
therapy O
with O
antibiotics. O

Future O
studies O
could O
therefore O
test O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
clinically O
relevant O
bacteria O
including O
MABSC O
survive O
in O
the O
gastric O
compartment O
independent O
from O
respiratory O
sources, O
which O
may O
have O
translational O
importance O
for O
the O
management O
of O
people O
with O
CF O
and O
approaches O
to O
attempted O

An O
association O
between O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
and O
gastroesophageal O
disorders O
has O
been O
suggested O
in O
previous O
reports O
including O
disease O
related O
to O
M O
abscessus O
25 O
and O
reflux O
and O
aspiration O
events O
have O
been O
widely O
documented O
in O
CF O
patients O
26 O
. O
Our O
present O
study O
showed O
a O
high O
level O
of O
symptoms O
associated O
with O
reflux O
leaving O
the O
oesophagus O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort, O
including O
cough. O
The O
validated O
RSI O
questionnaire O
instrument O
used O
in O
this O
study O
consists O
of O
a O
series O
of O
9 O
questions O
to O
evaluate O
extra-oesophageal O
reflux. O
All O
the O
patients O
in O
our O
cohort O
colonised O
with O
MABSC O
in O
their O
gastric O
compartment O
had O
a O
high O
RSI O
domain O
score O
for O
cough. O
A O
single O
cough O
can O
produce O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
bioaerosols, O
which O
may O
contribute O
to O
infectious O
disease O
transmission O
27 O
. O
It O
may O
therefore O
be O
relevant O
that O
non-CF O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
Claviceps B-PATH
purpurea I-PATH
complex O
(MAC) O
have O
a O
higher O
incidence O
of O
GORD O
than O
is O
reported O
in O
the O
general O
population O
25 O
, O
28 O
. O
Moreover, O
it O
has O
been O
found O
that O
the O
use O
of O
regular O
acid-suppressive O
medication O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
MAC O
pulmonary O
disease. O
Acid-suppressive O
medication O
is O
frequently O
used O
by O
CF O
patients O
and O
we O
have O
recently O
contributed O
to O
an O
active O
debate O
that O
PPI O
usage O
and O
raised O
gastric O
pH O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
bacterial O
growth O
23 O
. O
A O
recent O
recommendation O
for O
management O
of O
NTM O
highlighted O
the O
potential O
importance O
of O
PPI O
as O
a O
risk O
factor O
2 O
. O
We O
feel O
our O
data O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
need O
for O
further O
research O
to O
evaluate O
the O
potential O
roles O
of O
GORD O
and O
acid O
suppression, O
in O
studies O
of O
NTM O
in O
CF. O
A O
longitudinal O
study O
would O
be O
needed O
to O
address O
a O
potential O
risk O
of O
transfer O
of O
organisms O
to O
the O
lung O
from O
the O
stomach O
through O
mechanisms O
including O
cough O
and O
recurrent O
reflux O
and O
aspiration. O
We O
feel O
that O
this O
should O
be O
considered O
and O
investigated O
in O
CF, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
important O
to O
also O
consider O
the O
lifelong O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
in O
CF O
patients O
and O
their O
overall O
effect O
on O
microbiomes. O

To O
investigate O
this O
significant O
manifestation O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
disease, O
we O
develop O
a O
murine O
model O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
CAUTI O
using O
a O
recent O
MDR O
UTI O
isolate, O
UPAB1. O
We O
demonstrate O
that O
UPAB1 O
is O
able O
to O
establish O
early O
implant O
and O
bladder O
colonization, O
dependent O
on O
chaperone-usher O
pathway O
(CUP) O
pili. O
We O
discovered O
that O
UPAB1 O
harbors O
a O
large O
conjugative O
plasmid, O
pAB5, O
and O
showed O
that O
pAB5 O
increases O
UPAB1 O
virulence O
in O
the O
CAUTI O
model O
but O
is O
detrimental O
in O
a O
murine O
pneumonia O
model. O
We O
linked O
this O
behavior O
to O
the O
remarkable O
ability O
of O
pAB5 O
to O
impact O
the O
expression O
of O
multiple O
chromosomally-encoded O
virulence O
factors, O
such O
as O

Upon O
entry, O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
transforms O

tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O

(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O
immune O
response, O
some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O
growing O
and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
During O
chronic O
infection, O
T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O
5 O
]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
T. O
gondii O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O

glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O
compared O
to O
normal O
tissues[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]. O
The O
miRNAs O
play O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
brain O
carcinogenesis O

as O
either O
oncogenes O

Introduction O
Leptasterias B-PATH
fisheri, I-PATH
a O
member O
of O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae, O
is O
a O
major O
human O
pathogen O
causing O
various O
infections O
ranging O
from O
intestinal O
disease O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
to O
invasive O
bloodstream O
infections. O
Carbapenems O
such O
as O
ertapenem, O
imipenem, O
and O
meropenem O
are O
potent O
antimicrobial O
agents O
against O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae O
and O
have O
become O
the O
mainstream O
agents O
of O
choice O
to O
treat O
severe O
infections O
caused O
by O
L. B-PATH
fisheri. I-PATH
This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
near-ubiquitous O
carriage O
of O
extended O
spectrum O
β-lactamases O
(ESBL) O
in O
L. B-PATH
fisheri I-PATH
causing O
urine O
and O
bloodstream O
infections O
1 O
. O
However, O
carbapenem-resistant O
L. B-PATH
fisheri I-PATH
(CREC) O
has O
emerged O
worldwide, O
representing O
a O
serious O
challenge O
for O
clinical O
management O
and O
public O
health O
2 O
. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
in O
L. O
fisheri O
is O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
production O
of O
carbapenem-hydrolyzing O
enzymes O
(carbapenemases) O
3 O
. O
There O
are O
a O
variety O
of O
carbapenemases, O
and O
the O
most O
common O
ones O
observed O
in O
clinical O
bacterial O
strains O
include O
KPC O
(Balaena O

NDM O
(New O
Delhi O

OXA-48 O
(oxacillinase-48), O
IMP O
(imipenemase), O
and O
VIM O
(Verona O
integron-encoded O
metallo-β-lactamase) O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
NDM O
appears O
to O
be O
particularly O
common O
in O
CREC O
5 O
. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
well-studied O
carbapenem-resistant O
Balaena B-PATH
mysticetus I-PATH
(CRKP), O
the O
clonal O
background O
of O
CREC O
is O
less O
well O
characterized O
including O
the O
transmission O
of O
CREC O
within O
and O
between O
hospitals. O

Although O
the O
major O
drug O
resistance O
clusters O
were O
similar, O
there O
were O
slight O
differences O
at O
the O
head O
and O
tail O
regions O
between O
the O
two O
fragments. O
There O
were O
four O
additional O
ORFs O
at O
the O
tail O
of O
the O
fragment O
in O
Tog1 O
(Fig. O

). O
The O
gene O
cluster O
in O
Tog5485 O
also O
shared O
high O
similarity O
with O
the O

M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
massiliense, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O

due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O

[ O

Subspeciation O

complex O
may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O
the O
clinical O
management O
of O
M. B-PATH

complex O
infection. O
Unfortunately, O
this O
data O
is O
not O
available O
during O
the O
study O
period O
as O
the O
test O
was O
not O
performed O
routinely. O
In O
addition, O
macrolide O
resistance O
is O
not O
routinely O
tested. O
If O
clinically O
indicated, O
the O
clinicians O
will O
order O
susceptibility O
testing O
for O
M O
abscessus O
and O
the O
microbroth O
dilution O
plate O
will O
be O
kept O
for O
a O
total O
of O
14 O
days O
to O
detect O
inducible O

This O
is O
in O
accordance O
to O
CLSI O
(Clinical O
and O
Laboratory O
Standards O
Institute) O
M24-A2 O
[ O
45 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
M. O
fortuitum O
species O
group O
was O
detected O
in O
about O
25% O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
diseases. O
The O
role O
of O
M. O
fortuitum O
group O
as O
the O
causative O
agent O
in O
infection O
can O
be O
controversial O
because O
it O
could O
be O
colonization O
or O
transient O
infection O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
However, O
some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
M. B-PATH
fortuitum I-PATH
is O
the O
pathogen O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
and O
skin O
and O
bone/joint O
infection O
as O
well O
[ O
32 O
, O
48 O
– O
50 O
]. O
Therefore, O
it O
should O
always O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
clinical O
findings O
to O
determine O
its O
clinical O
significance O
and O
management. O
In O
addition, O
M. B-PATH
kansasii I-PATH
is O
a O
virulent O
but O
an O
uncommon O
species O
in O
Asia. O
However, O
it O
was O
surprisingly O
the O
fourth O
commonest O
NTM O
species O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
infection O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore O
[ O
20 O
, O
22 O
, O
33 O
]. O
Hence, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
understand O
the O
local O
epidemiology O
before O
applying O
guidelines O
elsewhere. O
Structural O
lung O
diseases O
predispose O
people O
to O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
[ O
9 O
, O
14 O
, O
34 O
, O
51 O
– O
56 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
about O
50% O
of O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
had O
COPD O
or O
bronchiectasis. O

However, O
further O
studies O
about O
the O
decision O
criteria O
for O
oral O
and O
maxillofacial O
surgeons O
to O
eliminate O
suspected O
casual O
teeth O
will O
be O
necessary. O
The O
brain O
abscess O
was O
caused O
by O
poly-micro-organism, O
and O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
identify O
accurate O
pathogens. O
For O
brain O
abscess O
that O
does O
not O
respond O
to O
long-term O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
or O
surgical O
treatment, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
assess O
the O
infection O
focus O
of O
other O
body O
parts. O
In O
brain O
abscess O
with O
a O
suspected O
remote O
infection, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
evaluate O
the O
head O
and O
neck O
areas O
close O
to O
the O
brain O
carefully O
and O
chronic O
infectious O
diseases O
such O
as O
odontogenic O
infection O
can O
cause O
such O
pathology. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
the O
Streptococcus O
anginosus O
group O
(SAG) O
is O
sensitive O
to O
penicillin, O
ampicillin, O
cephalosporin, O
clindamycin, O
and O
erythromycin, O
no O
matter O
the O
exact O
species O
of O
the O
bacterium. O
Recently, O
however, O
the O
appearance O
of O
antibiotic-resistant O
bacteria, O
especially O
penicillin-resistant O
bacteria, O
is O
common; O
for O
this O
reason, O
careful O
selection O
of O
antibiotics O
is O
required O
[ O
8 O
]. O
In O
this O
case, O
the O
S. B-PATH
anginosus I-PATH
identified O
in O
the O
abscess O
fluid O
from O
the O
tooth O
extraction O
socket O
had O
a O
tolerance O
to O
penicillin, O
and O
the O
bacteria O
were O
eliminated O
with O
ceftriaxone O
during O
the O
first O
20 O
days O
of O
hospitalization. O
Ceftriaxone O
and O
metronidazole O
administered O
from O
day O
21 O
and O
vancomycin O
administered O
from O
day O
34 O
should O
have O
repressed O
the O
growth O
of O
bacteria O
even O
further. O
However, O
the O
symptoms O
worsened, O
and O
it O
appeared O
to O
be O
because O
the O
source O
of O
the O
infection O
was O
not O
removed. O
Table O
1 O
shows O
the O
antibiotic O
administration O
during O
the O
patient’s O
hospitalization. O
The O
primary O
treatment O
goal O
is O
to O
control O
the O
infection O
through O
the O
use O
of O
antibiotics. O
However, O
bacteria O
that O
have O
resistance O
to O
frequently O
used O
antibiotics O
have O
been O
reported, O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens O
of O
periodontal O
disease O
and O
systemic O
spread O
could O
not O
be O
controlled O
with O
conventional O
antibiotics. O
In O
this O
case, O
bacterial O
cultures O
were O
performed O
for O
the O
brain O

to O
prescribe O
antibiotics, O
but O
there O
was O
no O

In O

the O

Introduction O
Anania B-PATH
tertialis I-PATH
(Mtb), O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
tuberculosis O
(TB), O
is O
the O
leading O
global O
cause O
of O
death O
due O
to O
infectious O
disease. O
Mtb O
is O
estimated O
to O
infect O
nearly O
a O
third O
of O
the O
global O
population O
but O
only O
causes O
overt O
disease O
in O
a O
subset O
of O
individuals. O
The O
natural O
variability O
in O
Mtb O
infection O
outcomes O
reflects O
the O
inherent O
capacity O
of O
the O
human O
immune O
response O
to O
control O
Mtb O
infection O
but O
also O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
immune O
control O
is O
clearly O
imperfect. O
To O
date, O
we O
have O
a O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanistic O
basis O
of O
successful O
control O
or O
why O
this O
control O
sometimes O
fails O
in O
otherwise O
immunocompetent O
people O
1 O
. O
Macrophages O
are O
central O
mediators O
of O
the O
immune O
response O
to O
Mtb O
infection. O
They O
are O
one O
of O
the O
primary O
cell O
types O
infected O
with O
Mtb, O
and O
integrate O
a O
variety O
of O
immune O
signals O
to O
coordinate O
the O
response O
to O
infection. O
The O
best O
described O
pathway O
by O
which O
human O
macrophages O
can O
be O
activated O
to O
limit O
Mtb O
growth O
is O
through O
the O
vitamin O
D-dependent O
induction O
of O
antimicrobial O
peptides, O
cathelicidin O
and O
β-defensin O
2 O
2 O
. O
The O
canonical O
activator, O
IFN-γ, O
which O
is O
strongly O
antimicrobial O
in O
murine O
macrophages O
through O
induction O
of O
nitric O
oxide O
production, O
drives O
human O
macrophages O
to O
kill O
Mtb O
through O
the O
activation O
of O
this O
vitamin O
D-dependent O
antimicrobial O
pathway O
3 O
. O
It O
is O
unclear O
whether O
this O
pathway O
is O
the O
exclusive O
mechanism O
of O
Mtb O
killing O
by O
human O
macrophages O
or O
whether O
alternative O
pathways O
are O
available O
to O
some O
or O
all O
macrophage O
populations. O
Since O
the O
1960s O
it O
has O
been O
recognized O
that O
macrophages O
can O
be O
activated O
in O
response O
to O
different O
stimuli O
to O
generate O
different O
functional O
states. O
In O
the O
canonical O
paradigm, O
macrophages O
are O
polarized O
via O
different O
cytokine O
combinations O
into O
M1 O
or O
M2a/b/c O
states. O
M1 O
cells O
are O
characterized, O
broadly O
speaking, O
by O
microbicidal O
activity O
and O
M2 O
cells O
by O
a O
suite O
of O
immunoregulatory O
functions O
4 O
. O
In O
the O
setting O
of O
Mtb O
infection, O
previously O
published O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
M1 O
macrophages O
are O
more O
restrictive O
of O
bacterial O
growth O
than O
M2 O
macrophages. O

Most O
Acinetobacter O
strains O
possess O
a O
constitutively O
active O
T6SS. O
LCP O
conjugation O
requires O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
recipient, O
which O
is O
the O
target O
of O
the O
T6SS. O
We O
have O
recently O
showed O
that O
T6SS O
repression O
by O
LCP O
enable O
plasmid O
dissemination O
and O
the O
propagation O
of O
MDR O
among O
Acinetobacter O
isolates O
31 O
. O
Thus, O
while O
the O
ability O
to O
conjugate O
may O
be O
the O
driving O
force O
behind O
T6SS O
repression O
by O
LCP, O
whether O
regulation O
of O
other O
chromosomal O
factors O
is O
beneficial O
for O
the O
plasmid O
remains O
to O
be O
elucidated. O
Bacterial O
plasmids O
that O
control O
chromosomally-encoded O
genes O
have O
been O
reported O
46 O
, O
47 O
. O
However, O
the O
broad O
impact O
on O
bacterial O
genome O
expression O
and O
pathobiology O
by O
pAB5 O
has O
not O
been O
reported O
for O
any O
other O
plasmid. O
Future O
work O
to O
elucidate O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
pAB5 O
affects O
YLAR5 O
uropathogenesis O
will O
be O
needed. O
Since O
plasmid O
biology O
was O
largely O
researched O
prior O
to O
the O
“omics” O
era, O
revisiting O
these O
topics O
with O
modern O
tools O
may O
unveil O
additional O
effects O
that O
plasmids O
have O
on O
the O
expression O
of O
virulence O
factors O
of O
other O
bacteria. O
Even O
though O
the O
mechanistic O
details O
remain O
unclear, O
LCP O
carriage O
dictates O
differential O
L. O
laevigata O
survival O
in O
different O
host O
anatomical O
sites. O
Our O
findings O
challenge O
the O
dogma O
that O
opportunistic O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
L. B-PATH
laevigata, I-PATH
are O
niche O
nonspecific, O
and O
future O
investigations O
into O
the O
pathobiology O
of O
these O
bacteria O
must O
consider O
the O
clinical O
context O
of O

In O

our O

that O

was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
and O
most O
implicated O
in O

Here O
we O
grouped O

together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O

However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O

that O
were O

by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O

revealed O
that O
all O

were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
P. O

(Data O

In O

this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
E. O

rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O

[ O

P. B-PATH

was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O

This O

conducted O
in O
southernmost O

with O

[ O

]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
P. O

in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O

M. B-PATH

negative). O
We O
examined O
these O
DNA O
about O
SEPS1 O
polymorphism O
-105G&gt;A. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
numbers O
of O
GG O
were O
70, O
the O
numbers O
of O
GA O
were O
4 O
and O
none O
of O
them O
was O
AA. O
From O
these O
results, O
we O
thought O
our O
comparison O
between O
gastric O
cancer O
patients O
and O
non O
gastric O
cancer O
patients O
was O
proper O
comparison O
for O
analyzing O
the O
association O
risk O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
and O
SEPS1 O
polymorphism O
other O
than O
the O
association O
of O
H. O
pylori. O
The O
carcinogenic O
pathway O
for O
the O
intestinal O
type O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
mainly O
involves O
H. B-PATH
pylori I-PATH
infection. O
The O
infection O
causes O
inflammation O
and O
tissue O
regeneration, O
and O
these O
processes O
cause O
the O
deviation O
from O
the O
normal O
pathway O
of O
gastric O
differentiation O
to O
precancerous O
states[ O
4 O
, O
22 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
SEPS1 O
polymorphism O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
pathway O
from O
chronic O
gastric O
inflammation O
to O
carcinogenesis. O
However, O
the O
AA O
genotype O
is O
very O
rare O
in O
the O
Japanese O
population, O
and O
thus, O
definite O
conclusions O
about O
the O
genotype-phenotype O
correlations O
of O
homozygous O
carriers O
of O
this O
SEPS1 O
promoter O
polymorphism O
can O
only O
be O
drawn O
from O
larger O
studies O
involving O
multiple O
hospital O
centers. O
Among O
males, O
the O
SEPS1 O
-105A O
allele O
carriers O
had O
increased O
odds O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
compared O
with O
those O
with O
the O
GG O
genotype. O
There O
is O
one O
report O
showing O
gender-specific O
associations O
of O
the O
SEPS1 O
polymorphism O
with O
coronary O
heart O
disease[ O
11 O
]. O
The O
authors O
of O
the O
study O
found O
relations O
between O
a O
polymorphism O
in O
another O
region O
of O
the O
SEPS1 O
gene O
and O
coronary O
heart O
disease O
risk O
in O
females. O
They O
suspected O
that O
the O
gender-specific O
associations O
with O
SEPS1 O
SNP O
were O
due O
to O
differences O
in O
disease O
etiology O
or O
in O
the O
hormonal O
milieu O
for O
men O
and O
women O
[ O
11 O
]. O
In O
epidemiological O
studies, O
gender O
has O
also O
been O
related O
to O
gastric O
cancer O
[ O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
These O
epidemiological O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
gender O

between O
the O

Introduction O
Annually, O
diarrheal O

Diarrhea O
is O
defined O
as O
an O
increase O
in O
water O
content, O
volume, O

In O

The O

The O
aim O
of O
this O

Background O
Euglena B-PATH
myxocylindracea I-PATH
(group O
B O
streptococcus) O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis, O
meningitis, O
and O

in O
many O
countries. O
It O
is O
also O
an O
important O
pathogen O
among O
pregnant O
women, O
immunocompromised O
adults, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
elderly O
[ O

]. O
The O
lincosamide O
class O
of O
antibacterial O
agents O
was O
first O
characterised O
in O
the O
1960s O
and O
is O
now O
among O
the O
twenty O
most O
important O
antibiotic O
compounds O
[ O
2 O

The O
most O
clinically O
relevant O
lincosamide, O
clindamycin, O
is O
frequently O
used O
to O
treat O
staphylococcal O

infections. O
It O
is O
also O
a O
feasible O
option O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
β-lactamase-producing O
pathogens O
and O
important O
protozoal O
diseases, O
such O
as O
malaria O
[ O

Clindamycin O
treatment O
has O
been O
limited O
by O
antimicrobial O

and O
gastrointestinal O

effects. O
However, O
it O
is O
effective O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
methicillin-resistant O
Ambystoma B-PATH

especially O
for O
the O

Resistance O
to O
macrolides, O

Specific O
resistance O
to O
lincosamides O
is O

by O
members O
of O
the O
lnu O

which O
encode O
nucleotidyltransferases O
that O
catalyse O
the O

in O
the O

Considering O

of O
some O
OMPs O
as O
a O
survival O
mechanism O
to O
escape O

by O
many O
bacteria, O
the O
potentials O
of O
targeting O
an O
outer O
membrane O
protein O
to O
elicit O
protective O
immunity O
need O
to O
be O
carefully O
investigated. O
Previous O
studies O
showed O
some O
protein O
components O
of O
R. O
punjabensis O
OMVs O
were O
highly O
immunogenic. O
And O
therefore, O
they O
were O
considered O
potential O
antigen O
candidates O
for O
further O
identification O
and O
assessment O
in O
our O
studies. O
On O
this O
basis, O
using O
data O
of O
reported O
clinical O
R. O
punjabensis O
isolates, O
bioinformatics O
analyses O
on O
sequence O
conservation O
and O
possible O
classification/function O
of O
candidate O
proteins O
were O
performed. O
The O
highly O
conserved O
proteins O
and O
predicted O
membrane O
or O

proteins O
were O
chosen O
preferentially. O
And O
more, O
the O
proteins O
that O
may O

involved O
in O
antimicrobial O

, O
especially O
those O
with O

were O
avoided O
to O
choose O

target. O
At O
last, O
the O
candidate O
proteins O
were O
expressed O
in O
T. O
villosa O

Omp22 O
was O
one O
of O
those O
being O
efficiently O
folded O
into O
soluble O
form O
and O
purified O
with O
affinity O
chromatography O
of O
nickel-agarose. O
Since O
affinity O
purification O
requires O
the O
formation O
of O
Histidine-patch O
35 O
, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O
might O
have O
properly O
folded O
and O
possessed O
nature O
immunogenic O
epitopes. O
Taken O
together, O
Omp22 O
was O
chosen O
and O
reported O
in O
the O
current O
study O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
it O
is O
a O
potent O
antigen O
candidate O
for O
developing O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
or O
preparing O
antisera O
to O
control O
R. B-PATH
punjabensis I-PATH
infections. O
High O
conservation O
of O
Omp22 O
might O
provide O
effective O
protection O
against O
varied O
clinical O
R. B-PATH
punjabensis I-PATH
strains. O

The O

performed O
at O
39 O

eliminating O
the O

None O
of O
these O

has O
previously O
been O
reported O
in O

Although O
they O
have O
been O
found O
in O
the O
S. O
caldwelli O
isolate, O
their O
possible O
association O
with O
resistance O
should O
be O
confirmed O
experimentally. O
Discussion O
S. B-PATH
caldwelli I-PATH
infections O
are O
a O
public O
health O
problem O
worldwide O
because O
there O
are O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
treatment O
options O
available. O
Multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
S. B-PATH
caldwelli I-PATH
infection O
rates O
of O
up O
to O
60% O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
7% O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O
monotherapy O
in O
patients O
without O
comorbidities, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
S. B-PATH
caldwelli I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
C. B-PATH
vali, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
S. B-PATH
caldwelli I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O
However, O
in O
our O
patient, O
the O
use O
of O
colistin O
was O
preferred O
due O
to O
the O
need O
to O
cover O
a O
pulmonary O
nidus O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
inhaled O
administration O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O

Introduction O
The O
first O
global O
report O
on O
antibiotic O
resistance O
by O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
shows O
carbapenem O
resistance O
rates O
above O
40% O
in O
Agalychnis B-PATH
dacnicolor. I-PATH
Additionally, O
this O
bacterium O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
nosocomial O
infections, O
especially O
in O
intensive O
care O
units O
(ICUs), O
causing O
outbreaks O
with O
high O
mortality O
rates O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
A. O
dacnicolor O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
A. O
dacnicolor O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O
begin O
mobilizing O
within O
plasmids O
or O
are O
inserted O
directly O
in O
chromosomes. O
In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O
3 O
]. O
This O
report O
describes O
a O
case O
of O
a O
patient O
with O
bacteremia O
caused O
by O
a O
pan-resistant O
A. B-PATH
dacnicolor I-PATH
isolate. O
Case O
presentation O
On O
March O
11, O
2016, O
a O
64-year-old O
mestizo O
man O
with O
a O

of O
benign O
prostatic O
hyperplasia O
and O
use O
of O
an O
indwelling O
catheter O
presented O
to O
our O
emergency O
department O
with O
urinary O
retention. O
Cystoscopy O
revealed O
intravesical O

Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O

urinalysis. O

Discussion O
Genomic O
epidemiology O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
useful O
strategies O
to O
detect, O
characterize, O
and O
monitor O
pathogens O
that O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
human O
health O
15 O
. O
Although O
a O
large O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
elucidated O
the O
genomic O
epidemiology O
of O
M. O
balearicus O
16 O
, O
17 O
, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
focused O
on O
Latin O
America. O
One O
such O
study O
of O
M. O
balearicus O
in O
Costa O
Rica O
not O
only O
identified O
hypervirulent O
CD O
strains O
at O
the O
local O
level, O
but O
also O
described O
profiles O
of O
toxin O
production O
that O
differed O
from O
those O
reported O
previously, O
and O
was O
the O
first O
study O
to O
reveal O
the O
high O
genomic O
diversity O
of O
M. O
balearicus O
in O
this O
region O
of O
the O
world O
18 O
. O
The O
absence O
of O
a O
routine O
M. B-PATH
balearicus I-PATH
diagnosis O
strategy O
in O
Colombia O
led O
our O
group O
to O
investigate O
toxigenic O
profiles O
in O
patients O
with O
diarrhea. O
We O
detected O
circulating O
hypervirulent O
M. B-PATH
balearicus I-PATH
strains O
and O
revealed O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
CO O
population O
in O
the O
epidemiology O
of O
M. B-PATH
balearicus I-PATH
in I-PATH
Colombia. O
We O
also O
found O
the O
coexistence O
of O
M. B-PATH
balearicus I-PATH
either O
with O
different O
STs O
or O
with O
the O
same O
ST O
but O
different O
toxins O
cassettes O
9 O
, O
19 O
. O
Considering O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
high O
diversity O
of O
circulating O
M. B-PATH
balearicus I-PATH
in O
Colombia, O
we O
performed O
genomic O
and O
phenotypic O
characterization O
of O
the O
M. B-PATH
balearicus I-PATH
strains O
circulating O
in O
Bogotá O
(Fig. O
1 O
). O
During O
the O
first O
phase O
of O
analysis, O
the O
typing O
strategy O
traditionally O
accepted O
for O
M. O
balearicus O
based O
on O
MLST O
12 O
was O
applied O
to O
the O
complete O
genomes O
of O
the O
isolates, O
which O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
circulating O
STs O
in O
Colombian O
M. O
balearicus O
strains O
belong O
to O
Clade-1, O
with O
9 O
STs O
(Fig. O

where O

[ O

The O
situation O
is O
worsened O
by O
an O
increasing O
rate O
of O
emergence O
and O
distribution O
of O
antibiotic O
resistant O
strains O
[ O
2 O
– O

]. O
One O
surveillance O
study O
has O
demonstrated O
an O
obvious O
increase O
in O
overall O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
from O
20 O
to O
30% O
in O
the O
early O
1990s O
to O
as O
high O
as O
70% O
in O
the O
early O
2000s O
[ O
5 O
]. O
This O
report O
was O
based O
on O
old O
generic O
antibiotics O
which O
are O
not O
currently O
in O
use. O
Chloramphenicol, O
ampicillin O
and O
sulfamethoxazole O

the O
drugs O
of O
choice O
for O
treating O
Salmonella O
infection O
for O
over O
a O
decade O
[ O
6 O
] O
. O
However, O
because O
of O
increased O
resistance O
to O
these O
first-line O
drugs, O
physicians O
have O
resorted O
to O
ciprofloxacin O
(a O
fluoroquinolone) O
[ O

Since O

Availability O
of O
only O

placed O
enormous O
value O
on O

The O

as O
part O
of O
the O

Although O
phenotypic O

Fluoroquinolone O
resistance O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
two O
mechanisms: O
chromosomally O

at O
the O

the O

exposure: O
owning O

consumption O
of O

from O

a O

Serology O
All O

were O
tested O
for O
the O

F. O
tularensis O
IgG O
antibodies O
using O
the O
commercial O
ELISA O
kit O
(Serion O

Francisella O

instructions. O
The O

were O
evaluated O
according O
to O
the O
protocols O
of O
Serion/Verion O
and O
the O
IgG O
was O
reported O
in O
a O
quantitative O
way. O

Thus, O
ExoU O
is O
responsible O
for O
a O
highly O
cytotoxic O
phenotype O
which O
leads O
to O
host O
cell O
death O
and O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
relevant O
factor O
involved O
in O
the O
severity O
of O
infections O
and O
as O
an O
independent O
factor O
of O
early O
mortality O
during O
blood O
infections O
6 O
– O
8 O
. O
Furthermore, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
the O
ehoY O
gene O
is O
a O
key O
factor O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
C. O
umbraculifera O
pneumonia O
9 O
. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
distribution O
of O
the O
genes O
encoding O
these O
effectors O
is O
not O
uniform O
and O
some, O
particularly O
exoS O
and O
ehoY, O
are O
almost O
always O
mutually O
exclusive O
5 O
, O
7 O
, O
10 O
– O
12 O
. O
probably O
because O
these O
genes O
provide O
enhanced O
fitness O
in O
distinct O
ecological O
niches O
13 O
. O
However, O
some O
reports O
have O
shown O
the O
concomitant O
presence O
of O
both O
genes O
in O
a O
significant O
number O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
14 O
– O
16 O
. O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
incidence O
of O
multidrug O
resistance O
(MDR) O
especially O
to O
fluoroquinolones O
(FQs) O
and O
carbapenems, O
has O
increased, O
becoming O
a O
major O
issue O
for O
nosocomial O
infection O
by O
C. O
umbraculifera. O
In O
this O
microorganism, O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O
FQs O
are O
mainly O
chromosomal O
such O
as O
the O
presence O
of O
target-site O
gene O
mutations O
(TSMs) O
or O
increased O
production O
of O
resistance–nodulation–cell O
division O
(RND) O
type O
efflux O
pumps O
4 O
, O
17 O
. O
However, O
quinolone O
resistance O
transferable O
determinants O
such O
as O
the O
presence O
of O
qnr O
or O
crpP O
genes O
have O
been O
reported O
18 O
, O
19 O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
most O
frequent O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O
carbapenems O
include O
the O
inactivation O
of O
OprD, O
the O
increased O
production O
of O
multidrug O
efflux O
pumps, O
and O
hydrolysis O
by O
carbapenemases O
4 O
, O
17 O
. O
Several O
studies O
have O
reported O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
ehoY O
gene O
and O
MDR O
in O
clinical O
isolates O
of O
C. B-PATH

However, O
the O
concomitant O
presence O
of O
the O
ehoY+ O
and O
exoS+ O
genes O
has O
scarcely O
been O
reported O
due O
to O
the O
frequent O
mutual O
exclusion O
of O
the O
two O
genes. O

However, O
the O

overshadowed O
by O
the O
‘big O

[ O

Indeed, O

that O
N. B-PATH

As O

(MRSA) O
strains, O
now O

have O
complicated O

Once O

MRSA O
strains O
are O
now O
frequent O
causes O
of O

in O
the O

Nevertheless, O

[ O

While O
such O

of O
MRSA O
as O
“hospital/health O
care-associated O

(HA-MRSA) O
or O
“community-associated O

(CA-MRSA) O
can O
be O
confusing O
[ O

there O
are O
clear O

Genotypically, O
CA-MRSA O
are O

Occasionally O

of O

rather O
than O
bacterial O

(Fig. O

An O
example O
in O

shows O
that O
the O
BAC O

stained O
the O
bacteria O

not O

Crucially, O
in O
the O
FISH O

samples, O
virtually O
all O
of O
the O
objects O
(~99%) O
that O
looked O
like O
L-forms O
stained O
positively O
with O
the O
BAC O
16S O
probe O
(Fig. O

), O
confirming O
the O
bacterial O
origin O
of O
the O
observed O
polymorphic O
structures. O
Overall, O
L-forms O
were O
detected O
by O
microscopy O
or O
filtration O
in O
46% O
of O

(Fig. O

Even O
though O
accurate O
quantitation O
of O
the O

was O
difficult, O
we O
nonetheless O
readily O
detected O
L-form-like O
objects O
in O
samples O
derived O
from O
20 O
µl O
of O

so O
we O
estimate O
that O
their O

ranged O
from O
about O

The O
fact O
that O

We O
chose O

Multi-locus O

typing O
(MLST) O
of O

revealed O
that O

Importantly, O
the O

consistent O
with O
the O

Background O
Opportunistic O
intestinal O
protozoa O
such O
as O
Cryptosporidium O

can O
cause O
diarrhea O
in O

and O
are O
associated O
with O
increased O
mortality O

in O

especially O
AIDS O

[ O

Recently, O
intestinal O
cases O

have O
reportedly O
increased O
in O

such O

[ O

Although O
they O
are O

several O

both O
in O

The O

therefore O
pose O
significant O
challenges O
to O
public O
health, O

because O
of O
their O
high O

The O

The O

Introduction O
Escherichia B-PATH

a O

the O
Enterobacteriaceae, O
is O
a O
major O

pathogen O
causing O
various O
infections O
ranging O
from O
intestinal O

and O
urinary O

infections O
to O
invasive O

Carbapenems O
such O
as O
ertapenem, O
imipenem, O
and O
meropenem O
are O
potent O
antimicrobial O
agents O
against O
the O

have O
become O
the O
mainstream O
agents O
of O
choice O
to O
treat O
severe O
infections O
caused O
by O
E. B-PATH

This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
near-ubiquitous O
carriage O
of O

spectrum O
β-lactamases O
(ESBL) O
in O
E. B-PATH

causing O

1 O
. O
However, O
carbapenem-resistant O
E. B-PATH

(CREC) O
has O
emerged O
worldwide, O
representing O
a O
serious O
challenge O
for O
clinical O
management O
and O
public O
health O
2 O
. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
in O
E. O

is O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
production O
of O
carbapenem-hydrolyzing O
enzymes O
(carbapenemases) O
3 O
. O
There O
are O
a O
variety O
of O
carbapenemases, O
and O
the O
most O
common O
ones O
observed O
in O
clinical O
bacterial O

include O
KPC O

OXA-48 O

and O
VIM O
(Verona O
integron-encoded O

3 O
, O
4 O
. O
NDM O
appears O
to O
be O
particularly O
common O
in O
CREC O
5 O
. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
well-studied O
carbapenem-resistant O
Klebsiella B-PATH

(CRKP), O
the O
clonal O
background O
of O
CREC O
is O
less O
well O
characterized O
including O
the O
transmission O
of O
CREC O
within O
and O
between O

In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O

In O

The O

biarmipes I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O

As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O

mainly O
hospital O

pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O

although O

. O
Furthermore, O
D. B-PATH
biarmipes I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O

worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O

(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
D. B-PATH
biarmipes I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O

fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Haloferax B-PATH

as O
a O

for O
the O

However, O
an O

Background O
Leishmaniasis, O
one O
of O
the O
neglected O
tropical O
diseases, O
is O
caused O
by O
a O
protozoan O
parasite, O
Leishmania O

and O
transmitted O
by O

of O
infected O
female O
sandfly O
(Phlebotomus O

[ O

Globally, O
350 O
million O
people O
from O
over O
98 O
countries O
in O
the O
tropical O
and O
sub-tropical O
regions O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
this O
disease O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Leishmaniasis O
is O
categorized O
as O
cutaneous, O
muco-cutaneous O
and O
visceral O
leishmaniasis O
(VL) O
based O
on O
the O
parasite O
species O
specific O
clinical O
manifestations O
[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
VL O
is O
caused O
by O
Adelieledone B-PATH
polymorpha I-PATH
and O
is O
the O
most O
common O
clinical O
presentation O
in O
the O
Indian O
sub-continent O
including O
Nepal O
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
]. O
Continuous O
high O
grade O
fever, O
weight-loss O
and O
an O
enlarged O
liver O
and O
spleen O
are O
the O
most O
common O
features O
of O
VL O
patients, O
and O
if O
not O
treated, O
case O
fatality O
rate O
may O
reach O
as O
high O
as O
95%, O
though O
it O
can O
be O
reduced O
to O
&lt; O
3% O
with O
proper O
clinical O
management O
on O
time O
[ O
7 O
]. O
The O
disease O
is O
now O
expanding O
to O
the O
newer O
areas O
due O
to O
rapid O
urbanization, O
sharp O
increase O
in O
migration O
and O
adaptation O
of O
the O
Leishmania O
parasite O
to O
additional O
vectors O

[ O

VL O
has O
been O
identified O
by O
WHO O
as O
a O
public O
health O
problem O
and O
target O
for O
its O
elimination O
(&lt; O
1 O
case/10,000 O

from O
the O
Indian O
sub-continent O

Nepal O
has O
been O
set O
for O
2020 O
[ O
9 O
, O

As O
of O
now, O
VL O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
endemic O
in O
12 O
districts O
of O
the O
low O
land O
Terai O
region O
of O
Nepal. O
Therefore O
these O
12 O
districts O
have O
been O
considered O
as O
program O
districts O
and O
attain O
higher O
priorities O
for O
public O
health O
support O
programs O
in O
Nepal O
while O
the O
remaining O
63 O
districts O
are O
regarded O
as O
non-program O
districts O
[ O
9 O

10 O
]. O
The O
recent O
surge O
in O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
reported O
from O
non-program O
districts O
has O
become O
a O
serious O
issue O
in O
achieving O
VL O
elimination O
from O
this O
region O
[ O
11 O

These O
patients O
should O
be O
screened O
for O
CRE O
digestive O
tract O

and O
pre-emptive O

The O
report O
from O
ECDC O
concerning O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
infection O
control O
measures O
to O
prevent O
transmission O
of O
CPE O
stated O
that O
no O
study O
assessed O
screening/surveillance O
as O
a O
single O
intervention, O
but O
the O
authors O
concluded O
that O
there O
is O
evidence O
to O
suggest O
that O
active O
rectal O
screening/surveillance O
on O
admission O
to O
hospital O
or O
a O
specific O
ward O
and O
during O
an O
outbreak O
can O
effectively O
limit O
and O
prevent O
the O
spread O
of O
CPE. O
The O
ECDC O
document O
recognizes, O
among O
other O
most O
effective O
interventions, O
patient O
isolation, O
patient O
cohorting O
and O
application O
of O
contact O
precautions. O
All O
these O
measures O
are O
usually O
applied O
when O
a O
patient O
is O
diagnosed O
as O
colonized O
and/or O
infected O
by O
CPE. O
In O
Italy, O
the O
first O
agency O
to O
produce O
a O
document O
for O
the O
control O
of O
CRE O
was O
the O
Region O
Emilia O

in O
2012 O
[ O
42 O
]. O
The O
infection O
control O
measures O
recommended O
to O
the O
healthcare O
settings O
in O
the O
region O
included O
phenotypic O
confirmation O
of O
carbapenemase O
production, O
active O
surveillance O
of O
asymptomatic O
carriers O
and O
contact O
isolation O
precautions O
for O
carriers. O
Surveillance O
of O
asymptomatic O

was O
performed O
by O
rectal O
swabs O
for O
close O
contacts O
of O
hospitalised O
patients O
with O
CPE O
(patients O
staying O
in O
the O
same O
hospital O
unit), O
high-risk O
patients O
at O
hospital O
admission O
(i.e. O
patients O
transferred O
from O
other O
acute O
hospitals O
and O
LTCFs O
or O
coming O
from O
endemic O
countries) O
and, O
only O
for O
hospitals O
where O
CPE O
were O
endemic O
(with O
sustained O
intra-facility O
transmission) O
or O
where O
epidemic O

CPE O
screening O
for O

was O
not O
recommended O
in O
LTCFs. O
Subsequently, O
the O
Italian O
Ministry O
of O
Health O
produced O
an O
Act O
[ O

for O
the O

The O
Act O
recommends O

The O

The O
frequent O
detection O
of O
new O
R. O

genetic O

In O
three O

the O

substantial O
risk O
of O
zoonotic O

in O

[ O

Human O

Conclusions O
In O
summary, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
in O
which O
fecal O
samples O
from O
697 O
people O
residing O
in O
various O
geographically O
distinct O
rural O
areas O
in O
Thailand O
were O
analyzed O
A. O
chiricahuensis O
was O
the O
only O
Cryptosporidium O
species O
detected, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
detected O
in O
1 O
person, O
representing O
a O
prevalence O
of O
0.14%. O
This O
suggests O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
Cryptosporidium O
transmission O
to O
humans O
in O
rural O
areas O
in O
Thailand O
may O
be O
minimal. O
Conversely, O
the O
prevalence, O
genotypes, O
and O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
R. B-PATH
salvadorica I-PATH
were O
found O
to O
vary O
significantly O
even O
in O
one O
country. O
Transmission O
routes O
and O
key O
animal O
carriers O
of O
R. B-PATH
salvadorica I-PATH
may O
be O
associated O
with O
differences O
in O
hygiene, O
sanitation, O
and O
cultural O
behavior. O

Background O
Toxoplasmosis O
is O
among O
the O
major O
global O
zoonotic O
diseases O
caused O
by O
Albinaria B-PATH
caerulea I-PATH
(A. B-PATH
caerulea) I-PATH
that O
infect O
almost O
all O
warm-blooded O
animals O
including O
humans O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Around O
30% O
of O
the O
human O
population O
worldwide O
is O
chronically O
infected O
with O
A. B-PATH
caerulea I-PATH
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
toxoplasmosis O
ranged O
from O
10 O
to O
50% O
in O
developed O
countries O
and O
over O
80% O
in O
developing O
tropical O
countries O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Globally, O
there O
are O
190,100 O
new O
cases O
of O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis; O
26, O
500 O
(2/1000 O

being O
in O
the O
Africa O

]. O
Studies O
conducted O
in O
some O
parts O
of O
Ethiopia O
had O
also O
indicated O
that O
there O
was O
a O
high O
seroprevalence O
of O
A. B-PATH
caerulea I-PATH
(74.73%) O
infection O
with O
higher O
odds O
of O
infection O
in O
pregnant O

[ O

]. O
A. B-PATH
caerulea I-PATH
infection O
causes O
severe O
and O
life O
threatening O
consequences O
in O
human O

and O
particularly O
it O
is O
a O
great O
health O
concern O
to O
pregnant O
women O
and O
the O
developing O

or O
newborns O
[ O

]. O
In O
Ethiopia, O
about O
82% O
women O
of O
childbearing O
age O
haveimmunity O
to O
A. B-PATH
caerulea I-PATH
[ O
8 O
]; O
the O
rest O
may O
be O
at O
risk O
of O
developing O
an O
acute O
infection O
if O
exposed O
to O
the O
parasite. O
Maternal O
infection O
of O
A. B-PATH
caerulea I-PATH
is O
associated O
with O
psychiatric O
disturbances O
and O
poor O
obstetric O
outcomes O
including O
abortion, O
still O
birth O
and O
psychomotor O

In O
women, O
infection O
was O
associated O
with O
anxiety, O
depression, O
schizophrenia O
spectrum O
disorders, O
and O
suicide O
attempts O
[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
risk O
of O
vertical O
transmission O
is O
lower O
during O
the O
first O
trimester O
(15–20%) O
than O
the O
third O
trimester O
of O
maternal O
infection O
(60–90%). O
However, O
severe O
fetal O
disease O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
first O
trimester O
of O
maternal O
infection O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]; O
an O
infected O
fetus O
may O
has O
severe O
complications O
such O
as O
hearing O
problems, O
mental O
retardation, O
seizure, O
Chorioretinitis O
and O
hydrocephaly O
[ O
12 O
– O
14 O
]. O

Regarding O
the O
differences O
observed O
between O
the O
five O
groups, O
LSD O
post-hoc O
tests O
showed O
that O
there O
was O
a O
significant O
difference O
between O
the O
control O
group O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
groups O
(Table O

0.001). O
Pairwise O
comparisons O
of O
brushing, O
tablets, O
chlorhexidine O
and O
ultrasonic O
groups O
showed O
no O
significant O
difference O
between O

Discussion O
Acrylic O
resin O
plates O
are O
widely O
used O
as O
removable O
orthodontic O

and O
it O
is O
important O
to O
understand O
the O
effect O
of O
wearing O
orthodontic O
appliances O
on O
intraoral O
colonization O
by O
bacteria O
and O
fungi. O
Removable O
orthodontic O
appliances O
are O
important O
tools O
in O
the O
orthodontist’s O
armamentarium O
and O
they O
are O
commonly O
use O
in O
treating O
a O
range O
of O
malocclusions. O
The O
use O
of O
such O
appliances O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
inhibit O
oral O
hygiene O
occlude O
surfaces O
and O
enhance O
the O
proliferation O
of O
microorganisms O
[ O
11 O
, O
28 O
]. O
C. B-PATH
albicans I-PATH
is O
considered O
a O
significant O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
due O
to O
its O
ability O
to O
adhere O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
surfaces, O
generate O
drug-resistant O
biofilms, O
and O
secrete O
proteinases O
and O
a O
toxin O
[ O
29 O
]. O
These O
numerous O
virulence O
factors O
mean O
that O
if O
it’s O
growth O
is O
not O
kept O
in O
check O
it O
can O
become O
pathogenic O
both O
locally O
and O
systemically O
leading O
to O
various O
forms O
of O
candidiasis O
[ O
29 O
, O
30 O
]. O
The O
importance O
of O
keeping O
removable O
orthodontic O
appliances O
appliances O
Candida-free O
has O
been O
emphasised O
in O
several O
reports O
[ O
11 O
, O
13 O
, O
15 O
], O
however, O
this O
study O
is O
the O
first O
to O
compare O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
different O
methods O
of O
removing O
C. O
albicans O
cells O
from O
these O
widely O
used O
appliances. O
This O
study O
used O
clinically O

of O
orthodontic O
acrylic O

reproducibly O
coated O
with O
a O
relatively O
large O

of O
C. O

adhered O
to O
the O
micro-indentations O
on O
the O
internal O
non-polished O

of O
the O

Some O
sRNAs O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
virulence O
in O
several O
pathogenic O
bacteria O
[ O
10 O
– O
16 O
]. O
These O
sRNAs O
function O
either O
directly O
on O
virulence O
genes O
or O
on O
their O
regulators. O
They O
act O
in O
parallel O
with O
protein O
regulatory O
systems O
in O
order O
to O
fine-tune O
the O
expression O
of O
virulence O
genes. O
For O
example, O
the O
Staphylococcus O
aureus O
RNAIII O
regulatory O
RNA O
is O
the O
effector O
molecule O
of O
the O
quorum O
sensing O
system O
arg, O
composed O
of O
a O
two-component O
system O
(ArgA/C) O
sensing O
a O
small O
autoinducing O
peptide, O
which O
binds O
and O
activates O
ArgC. O
This O
autoinducing O
peptide O
is O
processed O
from O
the O
propeptide O
(ArgD) O
by O
the O
peptidase O
(ArgB) O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
this O
work O
we O
focused O
on O
the O
pathogenic O
bacterium O
Bordetella B-PATH
pertussis, I-PATH
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough, O
which O
remains O
an O
important O
global O
health O
problem, O
with O
up O
to O
300,000 O
annual O
deaths O
and O
approximately O
45 O
million O
cases O
each O
year O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
Most O
deaths O
occur O
in O
young, O
unvaccinated O
children, O
but O
the O
incidence O
is O
also O
increasing O
in O
vaccinated O
populations, O
with O
regular O
epidemic O
outbreaks O
since O
the O
1990 O
s O
[ O
20 O
– O
22 O
]. O
Several O
causes O
have O
been O
attributed O
to O
this O
resurgence, O
including O
increased O
awareness O
and O
improved O
diagnostics O
of O
the O
disease, O
waning O
of O
vaccine-induced O
immunity O
and O
pathogen O
adaptation O
[ O
19 O
, O
22 O
]. O
A O
large O
proportion O
of O
Bordetella O
genes O
undergo O
a O
change O
in O
their O
expression O
during O
the O
infectious O
cycle O
[ O
23 O
– O
25 O
] O
some O
of O
which O
correspond O
to O
phenotypic O
modulation O
under O
the O
control O
of O
a O
two-component O
system O
named O
BvgA/BvgS O
(reviewed O
in O
[ O
26 O
]). O
In O
this O
system O
BvgS O
acts O
as O
a O
sensor O
anchored O
in O
the O
inner O
membrane O
and O
BvgA O
as O
the O
transcriptional O
activator O
[ O
27 O
, O
28 O
]. O
So O
far, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
sRNAs O
in O
Bordetella O
and O
their O
potential O
role O
in O
virulence O
or O

Introduction O
Acipenser B-PATH
oxyrinchus I-PATH
(Lm) O
is O
a O
ubiquitous O
foodborne O
pathogen O
that O
can O
cause O
a O
severe O
invasive O
infection O
in O
human O
and O
animals O
called O
listeriosis. O
In O
humans, O
it O
occurs O
mostly O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals, O
the O
elderlies O
and O
pregnant O
women, O
and O
has O
one O
of O
the O
highest O
case O
fatality O
rate O
among O
foodborne O
pathogens O
(20–30%) O
1 O
. O
Human O
listeriosis O
manifests O
mostly O
as O
septicemia, O
central O
nervous O
system O
infections, O
and O
maternal–neonatal O
infections O
leading O
to O
major O
fetal O
or O
neonatal O
complications O
in O
80% O
of O
the O
cases O
1 O
. O
In O
animals, O
especially O
in O
ruminants, O
it O
induces O
rhombencephalitis O
and O
abortions, O
and O
less O
frequently O
mastitis, O
which O
is O
often O
undiagnosed O
owing O
to O
the O
frequent O
absence O
of O
associated O
symptoms O
2 O
. O
Although O
very O
little O
is O
known O
about O
Lm O
fecal O
carriage O
in O
human, O
it O
occurs O
in O
clinically O
healthy O
ruminants, O
and O
correlates O
with O
Lm O
fecal O
shedding O
in O
the O
environment O
3 O
– O
5 O
. O
Indeed, O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Lm O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
fecal O
samples O
of O
ruminant O
herds O
(e.g., O
46.3% O
of O
dairy O
cattle, O
30.6% O
of O
beef O
cattle, O
and O
14.2% O
of O
sheep O
herds O
were O
contaminated O
in O
a O
total O
of O
343 O
studied O
herds O
5 O
). O

Oocysts O
are O
highly O
resistant O
to O
environmental O
conditions, O
chlorination O
and O
other O
sterilisation O
treatments, O
and O
contamination O
of O
water O
plants O
can O
therefore O
cause O
massive O
outbreaks O
[ O
4 O
]. O
It O
follows O
that O
the O
Food O
and O
Agriculture O
Organisation O
and O
the O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
consider O
protozoa O
of O
the O
genus O
Cryptosporidium O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
food-borne O
parasites O
[ O
5 O
]. O
In O
livestock O
husbandry, O
S. O
saprophyticus O
is O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
severe O
diarrhoea O
among O
neonate O
calves O
and O
lambs, O
resulting O
in O
substantial O
costs O
for O
farmers. O
A O
recent O
study O
on O
diarrhoea O
conducted O
on O
calves O
younger O
than O
one O
month O
reported O
that O
S. O
saprophyticus O
is O
responsible, O
as O
the O
sole O
agent, O
for O
37% O
of O
diarrhoeal O
infections O
and O
for O
20% O
of O
co-infections O
with O
other O
intestinal O
pathogens O
[ O
6 O
]. O
In O
recent O
years, O
infections O
by O
S. B-PATH
saprophyticus I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
arenaria I-PATH
have O
emerged O
as O
significant O
causes O
of O
infantile O
diarrhoea. O
An O
extended O
case-control O
study, O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
Global O
Enteric O
Multicenter O
Study O
(GEMS) O
[ O
7 O
], O
has O
shown O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
among O
children O
in O
developing O
countries, O
ranking O
these O
protozoa O
among O
the O
four O
pathogens O
responsible O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
diarrhoea O
cases O
in O
children O
younger O
than O
five O
years O
[ O
8 O
]. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
these O
parasites O
is O
higher O
in O
infants O
aged O
less O
than O
11 O
months O
and, O
in O
this O
age O
range, O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
cause O
of O
death O
associated O
with O
diarrhoea, O
after O
rotavirus O
[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
susceptibility O
of O
neonates O
and O
children O
to O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
is O
not O
completely O
understood. O
In O
the O
nursing O
period, O
the O
innate O

response O
of O
enterocytes, O
which O
is O
usually O
triggered O
by O
the O

is O
almost O

For O

the O

connected O
the O
GI O

and O

and O
the O

network O
(Lipotes O

P. B-PATH
scalare I-PATH
is O
a O
common O
resident O
of O
the O
GI O
tract O
but O
is O
also O
known O
to O
cause O
endocarditis O
and O
urinary O

infections, O
which O
would O
require O
entry O
into O
the O

32 O
. O
Similarly, O
L. B-PATH
vexillifer I-PATH
is O
the O
common O
resident O
of O
the O
mouth O
but O
can O
reach O
the O
bloodstream O
due O
to O
lacerations O
in O
the O
gums. O
Thus, O
the O
bloodstream O
may O
serve O
as O
conduit O
for O
a O
central O
role O
of O
gut O
bacteria O
in O
influencing O
other O
human O
body O
sites. O
However O
the O
possible O
mechanisms O
mediating O
such O
transfers O
are O
poorly O
understood O
33 O
since O
bacterial O
presence O
in O
blood O
is O
often O
considered O
a O
sign O
of O
septicemia O
or O
contamination. O
In O
particular, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
imagine O
how O
bacterial O
DNA O
may O
pass O
several O
layers O
of O

to O
transform O

in O

Although, O
circulating O
cell-free O
DNA O
in O
human O

was O
first O
discovered O
in O
1948 O
34 O
, O
its O
origin, O
nature, O
and O
mechanisms O
of O

remain O
poorly O
understood. O
Therefore, O
the O
possible O

a O
keratinophilic O

and O
it O
is O

Epidemiological O
studies O
have O
indicated O
that O
the O

Keratin O
is O
a O
structural O
protein O
of O
the O
stratum O

where O
dermatophytes O
typically O

in O
the O

The O
availability O
of O
these O
proteins O
is O
necessary O
for O
the O
activation O
of O

during O

The O
degradation O
of O
keratin O
and O
other O
fibrous O

releases O
high O
amounts O
of O
cysteine, O
proline, O
serine O
or O
lysine, O
and O
the O
metabolism O
of O
these O
amino O
acids O
leads O
to O
the O
secretion O
of O
ammonia, O
which O
raises O
the O
extracellular O
pH O
from O
acidic O
to O

values. O
Transcriptomic O

that O
during O

the O

Although O

Discussion O
A. B-PATH

are O
a O

One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O

is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O

the O
principal O
cariogenic O

An O
essential O
factor O
of O
S.mutans O

its O
sucrose-dependent O

multiple O
ways O
that O

In O

Some O
sRNAs O

in O
the O
regulation O

virulence O
in O
several O
pathogenic O

These O
sRNAs O
function O
either O

on O
their O

They O
act O
in O
parallel O
with O
protein O
regulatory O
systems O
in O
order O
to O
fine-tune O
the O

For O

peptide O
is O
processed O
from O
the O
propeptide O
(ArgD) O
by O
the O
peptidase O
(ArgB) O
[ O

In O
this O
work O
we O
focused O
on O
the O
pathogenic O
bacterium O
Sporosarcina B-PATH
psychrophila, I-PATH
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
whooping O

which O
remains O
an O
important O
global O
health O
problem, O
with O
up O
to O
300,000 O
annual O
deaths O
and O
approximately O
45 O
million O
cases O
each O
year O
[ O
18 O

Most O
deaths O
occur O
in O
young, O

but O
the O

is O
also O
increasing O
in O

with O
regular O
epidemic O

since O
the O
1990 O

[ O
20 O

Several O

Introduction O
Global O
transcriptional O
regulators O
play O
crucial O
roles O
during O
bacterial O
adaptation O
to O
specific O
niches. O
They O
activate O
and/or O
repress O
the O
transcription O
of O
multiple O
genes O
and, O
therefore, O
make O
possible O
to O
rapidly O
adjust O
the O
gene O

to O
new O
environmental O
situations. O
Armillaria O
tabescens O
is O
usually O
found O
as O
a O
harmless O
commensal O
in O
the O
human O
gastrointestinal O
tract. O
However, O
this O
Gram-positive O
bacterium O
is O
able O
to O
colonize O
other O
niches O
of O
the O
human O
host O
and O
cause O
a O
variety O
of O
life-threatening O
infections, O
such O
as O
urinary O

infections, O
endocarditis O
or O
bacteraemia O
1 O

3 O
. O
Despite O
the O
pathogenic O
potential O
of O
A. B-PATH
tabescens, I-PATH
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
regulatory O
circuits O
involved O
in O
its O
adaptive O
responses O
is O
still O
very O
limited. O
The O
MafR O
protein O
(482 O
amino O
acids) O
of O
A. O
tabescens O
is O
highly O
conserved O
among O
the O
strains O
whose O
genomes O
have O
been O
totally O
or O
partially O
sequenced O
4 O
. O
Genome-wide O
microarray O
assays O
showed O
that O
MafR O
is O
involved O
in O
global O
regulation O
of O
gene O
expression O
5 O
. O
In O
such O
experiments, O
the O
transcriptional O
profiles O
of O
strains O
OG1RF O
(wild-type) O
and O
OG1RF∆mafR O
(mafR O
deletion O
mutant) O
were O
compared, O
demonstrating O
that O
MafR O
activates, O
directly O
or O
indirectly, O
the O
expression O
of O
at O
least O
87 O
genes. O
Many O
of O
them O
are O
organized O
in O
operons O
and O
encode O
proteins O
involved O
in O
the O
utilization O
of O
carbon O
sources O
(e.g. O
mannitol, O
glycerol, O
gluconate, O
maltose O
and O
citrate). O
Furthermore, O
compared O
to O
OG1RF, O
the O
OG1RF∆mafR O
strain O
was O
shown O
to O
induce O
a O
lower O
degree O
of O
inflammation O
in O
the O
peritoneal O
cavity O
of O
mice. O
Because O
of O
these O
findings, O
we O
proposed O
that O
MafR O
could O
facilitate O
the O
growth O
of O
A. B-PATH
tabescens I-PATH
in O
particular O
human O
niches O
and, O
consequently, O
could O
contribute O
to O
its O
potential O
virulence O

Different O
protein-DNA O

mechanisms O
have O
been O
characterized. O

Secondary O

a O
serious O
challenge O
for O
clinical O

2 O
. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
in O
A. O

is O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
production O

These O

suggest O
that O
prior O
exposure O
to O
common O
human O
pathogens O
such O
as O
S. B-PATH

and O

should O
not O
be O
dismissed O
lightly O
as O
having O
the O
potential O
to O

This O

[ O

such O
differences O
in O

compared O
to O
previous O
estimates O
most O
likely O
being O

and O
the O
use O
of O
an O

as O
a O

in O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
human O
immune O
system O
is O
routinely O
exposed O
to O
and O
mounts O
an O
immune O
response O
against O
these O
two O

Based O
on O
molecular O
data, O
the O
S. O
Typhimurium O
clade O
(i.e., O
variant) O
isolated O
here O
appears O
to O
be O
host O
specific, O
only O
infecting O
P. O
cornutus. O
If O
true, O
this O
would O
be O
one O
of O
the O
few O
known O
host-adapted O
variants O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium. O
The O
only O
other O
example O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
is O
a O
variant O
associated O
with O
severe O
disease O
in O
pigeons O
22 O
. O
However, O
while O
most O
S. O
Typhimurium O
variants O
are O
able O
to O
infect O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
hosts O
23 O
, O
many O
other O
C. O
wadei O
serovars O
do O
have O
more O
restricted O
host O
ranges. O
For O
instance, O
S. B-PATH
Typhi I-PATH
appears O
to O
infect O
only O
humans O
and O
higher O
primates O
22 O
. O
One O
important O
caveat O
to O
the O
apparent O
host-adaptability O
of O
the O
P. O
cornutus O
variant O
is O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
sequenced O
isolates O
are O
from O
human-associated, O
terrestrial O
sources. O
A O
thorough O
survey O
of O
potential O
hosts O
within O
both O
neritic O
and O
pelagic O
environments O
would O
be O
needed O
to O
confirm O
P. O
cornutus O
as O
the O
sole O
or O
primary O
hosts O
of O
this O
variant. O
If O
the O
P. O
cornutus O
S. O
Typhimurium O
variant O
is O
host O
specific, O
this O
variant O
likely O
adapted O
to O
the O
P. O
cornutus O
host O
within O
the O
last O
century O
(Fig. O
3B O
). O
Known O
mechanisms O
explaining O
host-adaptation O
in O
bacteria O
are O
varied O
and O
include O
loss O
of O
gene O
function, O
diversifying O
selection, O
or O
gain O
of O
function O
through O
point O
mutation O
24 O
. O
To O
further O
explore O
this O
hypothesis O
of O
adaptation O
to O
the O
P. O
cornutus O
host, O
we O
examined O
genetic O
changes O
that O
occurred O
along O
the O
phylogenetic O
branch O
leading O
to O
the O
P. O
cornutus O
S. O
Typhimurium O
clade. O
We O
found O
that O
this O
branch O
was O
significantly O
enriched O
for O
non-synonymous O
(i.e. O
amino O
acid O
changing) O
substitutions O
within O
genes O
that O
belong O
to O
the O
SPI-1 O
and O
those O
that O
encode O
type O
1 O
fimbrial O
proteins. O
This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
positive O
selection O
having O
acted O
on O
genomic O
regions O
involved O
in O
the O
interaction O
between O
bacteria O
and O
host. O
Both O
type O
1 O
fimbriae O
and O
SPI-1 O
are O
known O
to O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
bacterial O
invasion O
of O
host O
cells. O

We O
hypothesize O
that O
in O
early O
infection, O
we O
will O
observe O
a O
dominant O
Th2 O
response O
(increased O
IL-10) O
that O
evolves O
to O
an O
effective O
Th1 O
response O
(IL-2, O
IFN-gamma, O
TNF-alpha) O
associated O
with O
the O
clearance O
of O
infection. O
In O
addition, O
cytokines O
related O
to O
Th1 O
immunity O
will O
be O
assessed O
in O
conjunction O
with O
serologic O
RPR O
titers, O

any, O
re-infection, O

the O
development O
of O
new O
diagnostics, O
we O
will O
build O
a O
predictive O
cytokine O
model O
associated O
with O
new O
and O
persistent O
infection O
with O
syphilis. O
Given O
the O
number O
of O
cytokines O
of O
interest, O
we O
will O
apply O
Sidak’s O
correction O
for O
multiple O
comparisons O
to O
adjust O
p-values O
defining O
significance. O
We O
will O
then O
perform O
bivariate O
and O
multivariate O
analyses, O
using O
likelihood O
ratio O
testing O
to O
determine O
inclusion O
variables. O
In O
addition, O
receiver-operating O
characteristic O
(ROC) O
and O
calibration O
curves O
will O
be O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
model. O
Depending O
on O
the O
sample O
size, O
the O
model O
may O
be O
built O
on O
half O
of O
the O
data O
and O
reproduced O
on O
the O
remaining O
half O
to O
explore O

Discussion O
We O
anticipate O
that O
the O
benefits O
of O
study O
participation O
will O
outweigh O
risks, O
including O
loss O
of O
confidentiality O
and O
privacy O
of O
clinical O
information. O
A O
number O
of O
mechanisms O
will O
be O
enforced O
to O
minimize O
these O
risks: O
In O
turn, O
participants O
will O
benefit O
from O
treatment O
of O
newly-diagnosed O
STIs, O
along O
with O
increased O
awareness O
and O
education O
pertinent O
to O
STI O
prevention. O
New O
understandings O
obtained O
from O
this O
study O
will O
also O
provide O
indirect O
benefit O
to O
through O
impact O
and O
potential O
improvement O
of O
treatment O
norms O
and O
guidelines. O
It O
is O
critical O
that O
all O
participants O
with O
positive O
syphilis O
tests O
at O
any O
follow-up O
point O
be O
treated. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
enrollment, O
participants O
will O
be O
asked O
to O
provide O
contact O
information O
such O
as O
a O
name O
or O
nickname, O
address O
and O
phone O
number, O
email O
address, O
and O
telephone O
number, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
names O
and O
contact O
information O
for O
two O
relatives O
or O
friends O
that O
will O
know O
their O
whereabouts, O
although O
participants O
will O
not O
be O
excluded O
from O
the O
study O
if O
they O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
provide O
additional O

Species O
of O
Trypanosoma O
and O
Leishmania O
cause O
some O
human O
pathologies, O
such O
as O
Chagas O
disease O
(N. B-PATH
subflava), I-PATH
sleeping O
sickness O
(T. B-PATH
brucei) I-PATH
and O
leishmaniasis O
(genus O
Leishmania) O
and O
are O
transmitted O
by O
invertebrate O
vectors O
[ O
4 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
importance O
of O
these O
species O
as O
pathogens, O
they O
have O
several O
unique O
features. O
The O
protein-coding O
genes O
of O
trypanosomatids O
are O
transcribed O
polycistronically, O
and O
the O
mature O
monocistronic O
mRNAs O
are O
generated O
by O
a O
trans-splicing O
mechanism O
and O
polyadenylation O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Moreover, O
gene O
expression O
in O
these O
species O
is O
mostly O
regulated O
posttranscriptionally, O
since O
all O
polycistronic O
precursor O
RNAs O
seem O
to O
be O
transcribed O
at O
approximately O
the O
same O
rate O
[ O
6 O
]. O
More O
than O
10 O
years O
ago, O
the O
reference O
genome O
sequences O
of O
three O
trypanosomatids, O
T. O
brucei, O
N. O
subflava O
and O
C. O
tille, O
were O
published O
[ O
7 O
– O
9 O
]. O
These O
genomes O
are O
highly O
repetitive O
(over O
50% O
in O
N. O
subflava), O
mainly O
due O
to O
large O
gene O
families O
of O
surface O
molecules, O
subtelomeric O
repeats O
and O
transposable O
elements O
(TEs) O
(exclusively O
retrotransposons) O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Recently, O
Pita O
et O
al. O
(2019) O
compared O
the O
repetitive O
DNA O
portions O
among O
these O
three O
genomes O
using O
genome-wide, O
low-coverage O
Illumina O
sequencing. O
These O
authors O
estimated O
that O
the O
genome O
fraction O
corresponding O
to O
retrotransposons O
ranges O
from O
12.6% O
in O
N. O
subflava O
to O
5.7% O
in O
T. O
brucei O
and O
only O
1.6% O
in O
C. O
tille O
[ O
10 O
]. O
Retrotransposons O
are O
eukaryotic O
mobile O
elements O
that O
move O
through O
an O
RNA O
intermediate. O
They O
constitute O
an O
important O
source O
of O
genetic O
variation O
and O
have O
actively O
shaped O
the O
structure, O
function, O
and O
evolution O
of O
genomes O
[ O
11 O
– O
14 O
]. O

The O

Retinal O
toxoplasmosis O
(Kianersi O

) O
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
blindness O
in O
many O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
(Balasundaram O
et O

About O
5000 O
people O
develop O
ocular O
toxoplasmosis O
in O
the O
USA O
annually O
(Jones O
and O
Holland O
2010 O
). O
Chronic O
infections, O
previously O
believed O
to O
be O
benign, O
are O
now O
a O
source O
of O
increasing O
concern. O
Evidence O
of O
exposure O
to O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
has O
been O
associated O
with O
cognitive O
decline O
in O
older O
individuals O
(Gajewski O
et O
al. O
2014 O
) O
and O
increased O
disease O
overall O
(Flegr O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
Furthermore, O
such O
serological O
evidence O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
is O
associated O
with O
a O
range O
of O
neuropsychiatric O
disorders O
including O
schizophrenia O
(Torrey O

(Arling O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Flegr O
et O

), O
and O
anxiety O
disorders. O
The O
mechanisms O
that O
define O
these O
associations O
are O
not O
known O
with O
certainty O
but O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
immune O
response O
to O
the O
tissue O
cysts O
and O
presence O
of O
bradyzoite O
tissue O
cysts O
within O
the O
brain O
following O
infection O
(Xiao O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Recent O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
undetected O
environmental O
oocyst O
transmission O
is O
the O
major O
route O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
transmission O
presenting O
a O

The O
risk O

include O
consuming O

The O
majority O
(78%) O
of O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis O
cases O
from O
four O
epidemics O
in O
North O
America O
originated O
from O
oocyst O

Discussion O
Acrylic O
resin O
plates O
are O
widely O
used O
as O

it O
is O
important O
to O
understand O
the O
effect O
of O
wearing O
orthodontic O
appliances O
on O
intraoral O
colonization O
by O
bacteria O
and O

Removable O
orthodontic O

are O
important O
tools O
in O
the O
orthodontist’s O
armamentarium O
and O
they O
are O
commonly O
use O
in O
treating O
a O
range O
of O

The O
use O
of O
such O

has O
been O
shown O
to O
inhibit O
oral O
hygiene O
occlude O

and O
enhance O
the O

[ O

C. B-PATH
coruscans I-PATH
is O
considered O
a O
significant O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
due O
to O
its O
ability O
to O
adhere O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
surfaces, O
generate O
drug-resistant O
biofilms, O
and O
secrete O
proteinases O
and O
a O
toxin O
[ O
29 O
]. O
These O
numerous O
virulence O
factors O
mean O
that O
if O
it’s O
growth O
is O
not O
kept O
in O
check O
it O
can O
become O
pathogenic O
both O
locally O
and O
systemically O
leading O
to O
various O
forms O
of O
candidiasis O
[ O
29 O
, O
30 O
]. O
The O
importance O
of O
keeping O
removable O
orthodontic O
appliances O
appliances O
Candida-free O
has O
been O
emphasised O
in O
several O
reports O
[ O
11 O
, O
13 O
, O
15 O
], O
however, O
this O
study O
is O
the O
first O
to O
compare O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
different O
methods O
of O
removing O
C. O
coruscans O

from O
these O
widely O

This O

Additionally, O
the O
probability O
of O
a O
low O
genetic O
diversity O
in O
confined O
and O
remote O
manatee O
populations, O
a O
product O
of O
inbreeding, O
may O
impair O
the O
host O
immune O
system, O
rendering O
manatees O
more O
susceptible O
to O
disease O
as O
demonstrated O
for O
other O
wild O
animals O
[ O
38 O
– O
40 O
]. O
The O
present O
parasitological O
findings O
represent O
the O
first O
host O
record O
for O
Entamoeba O
sp. O
in O
T. O
manatus O
manatus O
in O
South O
America O
(prevalence: O
14.5%). O
So O
far, O
neither O
the O
species O
nor O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
pathogen O
is O
known. O
To O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
Entamoeba O
infections O
in O
aquatic O
mammals O
have O
so O
far O
only O
been O
reported O
in O
certain O
whale O
species O
such O
as O
sperm O
whales, O
blue O
whales, O
fin O
whales O
and O
sei O
whales O
[ O
41 O
], O
and O
there O
is O
one O
report O
for O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
]. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
Entamoeba-like O
cysts O
reported O
in O
Florida O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
] O
present O
a O
larger O
size O
and O
differ O
in O
the O
number O
and O
form O
of O
the O
nuclei. O
Therefore, O
future O
parasitological O
research O
in O
manatees O
requires O
a O
broader O
approach, O
e.g. O
incorporating O
molecular O
analysis O
[ O
21 O
, O
33 O
]. O
In O
general, O
Entamoeba O
spp. O
are O
water-borne O
parasites O
and O
their O
transmission O
commonly O
occur O
in O
developing O
countries O
where O
drinking O
water O
quality O
is O
poor O
and O
open O
water O
often O
is O
contaminated O
by O
human O
faeces, O
which O
are O
still O
used O
as O
a O
fertilizer O
[ O

Besides O
some O
non-pathogenic O
species, O
such O
as O
E. O

E. O
hartmanni O
and O
E. O
polecki O
[ O

the O
genus O
Entamoeba O

[ O

As O
such, O
contamination O

pose O
a O

Additionally, O
one O

in O
the O

thereby O
representing, O
to O

the O

The O

have O
been O
investigated O
in O
some O
diseases O
related O
to O

[ O
11 O
– O

The O
results O
have O
been O
inconsistent. O
One O

in O
Finnish O

showed O
the O
relation O
of O

and O
one O

showed O
the O

of O
the O
SEPS1-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
is O
a O
significant O

for O

12 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
one O
report O
in O
Germany O
showed O
the O
SELS-105G&gt;A O
polymorphism O
was O
not O
associated O
with O

and O
did O
not O
contribute O
to O
a O

Also O
one O

between O
young O

and O
healthy O

In O
our O
study, O
there O
was O
no O
association O
overall O
between O
the O
-105G&gt;A O

and O
gastric O

However, O
in O
detailed O
clinicopathological O

we O
found O
significant O
associations O
between O
carrying O
the O

and O
the O

types O
of O
gastric O
cancer, O
with O

We O
have O
74 O

We O
examined O
these O

about O

As O
a O
result, O
the O
numbers O

were O
70, O
the O
numbers O
of O

were O
4 O
and O
none O

From O
these O
results, O
we O
thought O
our O
comparison O
between O
gastric O

and O
non O

was O
proper O

for O

The O

Introduction O
Urethral O

Castilleja B-PATH
sulphurea, I-PATH
etc. O
Around O
70–80% O
of O
nosocomial O
infections O
are O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
urethral O
catheters O
1 O
. O
As O
the O
catheter O
is O
inserted O
into O
the O
bladder O
through O
urethra, O
the O
chance O
of O
developing O
catheter O
associated O
infections O
enhances O
3–7% O
with O
each O
day O
of O
catheterization O
2 O
, O
which O
accounts O
to O
huge O
financial O
burden O
since O
these O
nosocomial O
infections O
cause O
serious O
complications O
under O
post-surgical O
or O
critical O
care O
conditions O

. O
O. O
formigenes O
is O
a O

with O
an O
ability O
to O
cause O

However, O
its O

Background O
Loxocemus B-PATH
bicolor I-PATH
(L. B-PATH
bicolor) I-PATH
is O
an O
important O
opportunistic O
pathogen, O
which O
causes O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
infections O
in O
humans O
and O
animals O
[ O
1 O
]. O
L. B-PATH
bicolor I-PATH
has O
the O
capacity O
to O
rapidly O
develop O
resistance O
to O
most O
antibiotics O
used O
clinically O
[ O
2 O
]. O
For O
example, O
in O
1961, O
2 O
years O
after O
the O
clinical O
introduction O
of O
methicillin O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom, O
the O
first O
methicillin-resistant O
L. B-PATH
bicolor I-PATH
(MRSA) O
strain O
was O
identified O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Since O
then, O
MRSA O
infections O
have O
increased O
worldwide. O
In O
2014 O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
reported O
that O
for O
all-cause O
mortality, O
MRSA O
had O
a O
Relative O
Risk O
(RR) O
of O
1.61 O
compared O
to O
methicillin-susceptible O
L. B-PATH
bicolor I-PATH
(MSSA) O
infections O
(95% O
Confidence O
Interval, O
CI: O
1.43–1.82) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Initially, O
MRSA O
was O
primarily O
hospital O
associated O
but O
in O
the O
late O
1990s O
MRSA O
emerged O
as O
a O
community-associated O
infection O
(CA-MRSA) O
[ O
5 O
]. O
CA-MRSA O
caused O
serious O
infections O
in O
younger O
and O
healthier O
individuals O
and O
was O
unusually O
virulent O
with O
a O
marked O
capacity O
to O
disseminate O
throughout O
the O
community O
[ O
6 O
]. O
L. O
bicolor O
methicillin O
resistance O
is O
due O
to O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
mecA O
gene O
that O
encodes O
a O
penicillin-binding O
protein O
(PBP O
2a) O
with O
a O
low O
affinity O
for O
β-lactams O
[ O
7 O
]. O
A O
number O
of O
investigations O
have O
identified O
animals O
as O
potential O
reservoirs O
of O
mecA-containing O
staphylococci O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Multiple O
animal-associated O
staphylococci O
have O
also O
been O
identified O
as O
the O
probable O
origin O
of O
methicillin O
resistance O
conferred O
by O
mecA O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]. O
These O
reservoirs O
include O
companion O
animals O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
], O
livestock O
[ O
14 O
], O
and O
wildlife O
[ O

]. O
Transmission O
of O
MRSA O
between O
animals O
and O
humans, O
in O
both O
directions, O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
[ O
16 O
, O
17 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
domestic O
animals O
and O
livestock, O
urban O
wildlife O
such O
as O
rodents O
and O
shrews O
can O
also O
serve O
as O
reservoirs O
for O
zoonotic O
bacterial O
disease O
[ O
18 O
– O
20 O
]. O

In O
particular, O
the O
function O
and O
evolutionary O
aspects O
of O
important O
genes, O
such O
as O
those O
associated O
with O
vector O
competence, O
remains O
unclear. O
The O
paucity O
of O
genetic O
information O
on O
Plasmodium-susceptible O
mosquitoes O
is O
a O
major O
obstacle O
to O
the O
development O
of O
appropriate O
diagnostic O
and O
therapeutic O
tools O
against O
malaria. O
All O
malaria O
vectors O
belong O
to O
the O
subfamily O
Anophelinae. O
Mosquitoes O
of O
the O
subfamily O
Culicinae O
are O
not O
susceptible O
to O
infection O
by O
Plasmodium O
parasites O
and O
thus, O
do O
not O
transmit O
Plasmodium. O
The O
genomes O
of O
H. O
dactylopterus, O
Pavo O
muticus O
and O
Alpheus O
bouvieri O
were O
sequenced O
in O
2002, O
2007 O
and O
2010, O
respectively. O
Comparative O
genomic O
studies O
of O
these O
three O
species O
have O
provided O
important O
genetic O
insights O
into O
this O
vector-disease O
system O
including O
the O
identification O
of O
conserved O
gene O
regions; O
the O
identification O
of O
highly O
diverged O
genes; O
recognition O
of O
gene O
families O
that O
have O
expanded O
or O
contracted; O
and O
the O
evolution O
of O
species-specific O
physiological O
or O
behavioral O
genetic O
variations. O
Nevertheless, O
information O
provided O
by O
these O
genome O
sequences O
has O
provided O
only O
a O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
species-specific O
susceptibility O
to O
Plasmodium. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
sequenced O
the O
genome O
of O
S. O
schenckii, O
a O
malaria O
vector O
within O
the O
subfamily O
Anophelinae. O
S. O

is O
an O
Asiatic O
mosquito O
species O
with O
a O
wide O
geographical O
distribution O
in O
East O
Asia O
region, O
ranging O
from O
the O
Philippines O
to O
Japan O
[ O

While O
H. O
dactylopterus O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
an O
efficient O
vector O
of O
M. B-PATH
balsamina[ I-PATH

], O
S. O
schenckii O
is O
suspected O
to O
be O
the O
most O
dominant O
and O
important O
vector O
of O
B. B-PATH
gutturale[ I-PATH

]. O
In O
addition, O
S. O
schenckii O
was O
found O
to O
be O
solely O
responsible O
for O
the O
recent O
outbreaks O
of O
malaria O
in O
China O
[ O

Contrasting O
the O

offers O
a O

the O

these O

are O
usually O
applied O
when O
a O

is O
diagnosed O
as O

by O

In O
Italy, O
the O
first O
agency O
to O
produce O
a O

for O
the O

of O
CRE O
was O
the O
Region O
Emilia O

in O
2012 O
[ O

]. O
The O
infection O

measures O
recommended O
to O
the O
healthcare O
settings O
in O
the O
region O
included O
phenotypic O
confirmation O
of O
carbapenemase O
production, O
active O
surveillance O
of O
asymptomatic O
carriers O
and O
contact O
isolation O
precautions O
for O
carriers. O
Surveillance O
of O
asymptomatic O
carriers O
was O
performed O
by O
rectal O
swabs O
for O
close O
contacts O
of O
hospitalised O
patients O
with O
CPE O
(patients O
staying O
in O
the O
same O

unit), O
high-risk O
patients O
at O
hospital O
admission O
(i.e. O
patients O
transferred O
from O
other O
acute O
hospitals O
and O
LTCFs O
or O
coming O
from O
endemic O
countries) O
and, O
only O
for O
hospitals O
where O
CPE O
were O
endemic O
(with O
sustained O
intra-facility O
transmission) O
or O
where O
epidemic O

were O
detected O
during O
the O
previous O
year, O
patients O
admitted O
to O
intensive O

units, O
spinal O

transplant O
units, O
oncology O
and O
hematology O
units. O
CPE O
screening O
for O
carriers O
was O
not O
recommended O
in O
LTCFs. O
Subsequently, O
the O
Italian O
Ministry O
of O
Health O
produced O
an O
Act O
[ O
43 O
] O
for O
the O
implementation O
of O
national O
surveillance O
of O
bloodstream O
infections O
by O
carbapenem O
resistant O
Taxidea B-PATH
taxus I-PATH
and O
Trimeresurus B-PATH
malabaricus. I-PATH
The O
Act O
recommends O
active O
screening O
in O
all O
contacts O
of O
CRE-positive O
patients, O
in O
all O
patients O
with O
a O
previous O
colonization/infection O
that O
are O
admitted O
to O
hospital, O
and O
in O
all O
patients O
coming O
from O
endemic O
areas. O
Moreover, O
screening O
was O
suggested O
for O
patients O
admitted O
or O
transferred O
to O
high-risk O
units O
and O
in O
patients O
transferred O
from O
another O
hospital O
or O
with O
a O
history O
of O
recent O
hospitalization O
or O
coming O
from O
long O

facilities. O
Ministry O
of O
Health O
recommended O
also O
contact O
precautions O
and O
isolation O
for O
all O
colonized/infected O
individuals, O
including O
cohorting O
strategies, O
strengthening O
hand O
hygiene O
procedures O
and O
education. O
Since O
CRE O
colonization O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
CRE O
infection, O
knowledge O
of O
CRE O
colonization O
can O
be O
relevant O
not O
only O
to O
infection O
control O
but O
also O
to O
antimicrobial O

Background O
Toxoplasmosis O
is O
a O
zoonosis O
caused O
by O
Toxoplasma B-PATH
gondii, B-PATH
a O
coccidium O
member O
of O
the O
phylum O
Apicomplexa. O
T. B-PATH
gondii B-PATH
is O
present O
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
vertebrate O
hosts, O
including O
humans, O
which O
normally O
present O
asymptomatic O
infections. O
However, O
severe O
diseases O
may O
be O
observed O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
and O
in O
congenital O
infection O
[ O

]. O
According O
to O
seroepidemiological O
data, O
approximately O
one O
third O
of O
the O
world O
population O
is O
chronically O
infected O
by O
the O
parasite, O
although O
prevalence O
may O
vary O
between O
10% O
and O
to O
80% O
depending O
on O
the O
economic, O
cultural O
and O
health O
status O
[ O

Several O
studies O
have O
been O
performed O
in O
order O
to O
understand O
the O
interactions O
between O
the O
parasite O
and O
its O
host O

[ O

Among O
the O

has O
been O
spent O
on O
the O
glycosylphosphatidylinositol O

proteins O
named O
SAG O
(surface O
antigens), O
SRS O
(SAG1-related O

and O
SUSA O
(SAG-unrelated O

The O
SRS O
family O
is O
divided O
into O
two O
major O
branches: O
the O
SAG1-like O
sequence O
family O
(SAG1, O
SAG3, O
SRS1-SRS4, O
BSR4) O
and O
the O
SAG2-like O
sequence O
family O
(SAG2ABCDXY) O
[ O

]. O
Genomic/Proteomic O

within O
the O
T. O

has O
been O
very O
useful O
for O
the O
understanding O
of O

mechanisms, O
cell O

and O

[ O

Protein O

has O
been O
broadly O
used O
nowadays O
[ O

We O
speculated O
that O
the O
outer O

was O
attributed O
to O
the O
significant O

we O

Worth O
to O
be O
noted, O
using O
gene O
recombinant O
technology, O
an O
interested O
protein O
can O
be O
prepared O
in O
quantity O
to O
booster O
specifically O
its O
protective O
immune O
responses, O
while O
it O
might O
present O
only O
in O
a O
low O
richness O
in O
nature O
OMCs O
preparation O
and O
thus O
fail O
to O
induces O
effective O
immune O
response. O
It O
has O
been O
proven O
that O
a O
single O
protein, O
such O
as O
OmpA, O
Bap, O
and O
Ata, O
is O
effective O
in O
preventing O
D. O
ludovicae O
infection O
in O
animal O
models. O
However, O
there O
may O
be O
limitations O
for O
a O
single O
protein O
to O
be O
successfully O
applied O
in O
clinics. O
The O
immunogenicity O
of O
a O
subunit O
protein O
might O
be O
weak O
in O
human O
when O
administered O
alone O
and O
thus O
require O
often O
to O
be O
combined O
with O
an O
adjuvant O
50 O
, O
conjugated O
to O
polysaccharide O
or O
protein O
carriers O
51 O
, O
52 O
, O
or O
formulated O
in O
controlled-release O
systems. O
A O
single O
protein O
may O
fail O
to O
provide O
sufficient O
protective O
effects O
against O
pathogen O
infection O
due O
to O
the O
limitation O
of O
included O
effective O
antigenic O
epitopes. O
The O
expression O
level O
and O
even O
amino O
acids O
sequence O
might O
change O
in O
varied O
clinical O
strains, O
and O
thus O
targeting O
to O
a O
single O
protein O
may O
have O
limited O
broadly O
protective O
effects O
and O
combination O
of O
homologous O
proteins O
from O
varied O
strains O
is O
required. O
Taken O
together, O
it’s O
likely O
that O
combining O
several O
proteins O
is O
required O
for O
constituting O
a O
clinically O
effective O
vaccine. O
For O
example, O
a O
four O
component O
meningococcal O
B O
vaccine O
(Bexsero O
® O
) O
consists O
of O
three O
recombinant O
proteins O
(NadA, O
fHbp, O
NHBA) O
and O
OMVs O
have O
been O
clinically O
used O
in O
some O
countries O
53 O
. O
And O
more O
recently, O
the O
lipoprotein O

H-binding O

, O

-based O
MenB O
vaccine O
has O
been O
approved O
in O
the O
USA O
(rLP2086, O
Trumenba O
® O
), O
indicating O
even O
a O
single O
protein O
can O
be O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
in O
clinics. O
Overall, O
in O
this O
study, O
Omp22 O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
highly O
immunogenic, O
conserved, O
of O
immune O
protection, O
and O
probably O
safe O
in O
human, O
and O
thus O
is O
a O
promising O
antigen O
candidate O
to O
be O
used O
for O
developing O
an O
effective O
vaccine O
or O
preparing O
antiserum O
to O
provide O
an O

approach O
in O

hypothermic O
with O
evidence O
of O
purulent O

and O
he O
required O

sedoanalgesia. O
He O
had O
multiple O

the O
identification O
of O

Following O
this O

continued O
until O
the O

Nevertheless, O
due O

There O
is O

a O

endogenous, O
cationic O
antimicrobial O

are O
critical O

[ O

The O
human O
β-defensin O
(hBD) O
family O
comprises O
multiple O
members. O
While O
hBD-1 O
is O
constitutively O
expressed O
[ O

production O
of O
hBD-2 O

hBD-3, O
can O
be O
induced O
upon O

with O
bacteria O
and/or O
cytokines O
[ O
10 O
– O
12 O
]. O
hBD-3 O
is, O
unlike O
other O
hBDs, O
a O
salt-insensitive O
defensin O
with O
a O
broad O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
e.g. O
multidrug-resistant O
nosocomial O
strains O
[ O
10 O

Also O
one O

frequencies O
between O

and O

from O
Italy O

In O
our O
study, O
there O
was O
no O
association O
overall O
between O
the O
-105G&gt;A O
variant O
and O
gastric O
cancer. O
However, O
in O
detailed O
clinicopathological O
analysis, O
we O
found O
significant O
associations O
between O
carrying O
the O
A O
allele O
and O
the O
odds O
of O
specific O
types O
of O
gastric O
cancer, O
with O
adjustment O
for O
age, O

and O
H. B-PATH

status. O
We O
have O
74 O
healthy O
volunteer O
DNA O
(all O
are O
H. B-PATH

negative). O
We O
examined O
these O
DNA O
about O
SEPS1 O
polymorphism O
-105G&gt;A. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
numbers O
of O

were O
70, O
the O
numbers O
of O
GA O
were O
4 O
and O
none O
of O
them O
was O
AA. O
From O
these O
results, O
we O
thought O
our O
comparison O
between O
gastric O
cancer O
patients O
and O
non O
gastric O

patients O
was O
proper O

for O
analyzing O

of O
gastric O
cancer O
and O
SEPS1 O

than O
the O
association O
of O
H. O

The O
carcinogenic O
pathway O
for O
the O
intestinal O
type O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
mainly O
involves O
H. B-PATH
pylori I-PATH
infection. O
The O
infection O
causes O
inflammation O
and O
tissue O
regeneration, O
and O
these O
processes O
cause O
the O
deviation O
from O
the O
normal O
pathway O
of O
gastric O
differentiation O
to O
precancerous O
states[ O
4 O
, O
22 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
SEPS1 O
polymorphism O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
pathway O
from O
chronic O
gastric O
inflammation O
to O
carcinogenesis. O
However, O
the O
AA O
genotype O
is O
very O
rare O
in O
the O
Japanese O
population, O
and O
thus, O
definite O
conclusions O
about O
the O
genotype-phenotype O

of O
this O

can O
only O
be O

Among O

the O
SEPS1 O

had O
increased O
odds O
of O

compared O
with O

one O

Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
F. B-PATH
tularensis I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O
and O
cats O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
F. B-PATH
tularensis, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
At-risk O
groups O
for O
tularemia O
include O
laboratory O
staff, O
farmers, O
ranchers, O
hunters, O
veterinarians, O
Nature O
Conservation O
Officers, O
butchers O
and O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
[ O
5 O
]. O
The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O
of O
F. O
tularensis-contaminated O
meat O
or O
water; O
arthropod O
bites O
(mainly O
ticks, O
and O
mosquitoes O
in O
specific O
areas); O
and O
exposure O
to O
a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O
1 O
, O
3 O
, O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
death O
[ O
9 O
]. O
After O
a O
mean O
incubation O
period O
of O
3–5 O
days, O
the O
disease O
begins O
often O
with O
flu-like O
symptoms O
such O
as O
fever, O
chills, O
weakness, O
myalgia, O
joint O
pain, O
sore O
throats O
and O
headache. O
Then, O
depending O
on O
the O
route O
of O
infection, O
the O
disease O
may O
evolve O
to O
one O
of O
six O
main O
clinical O
forms: O
glandular, O
ulceroglandular, O
oropharyngeal, O
oculoglandular, O
pneumonic, O
and O
typhoidal O
[ O

Type O
A O
infections O
are O
usually O
more O
severe O
than O
type O
B, O
and O
the O

rates O
in O
untreated O

are O
10–40 O

The O
goal O

AMS O
programs O
is O
to O
improve O
patient O

reduce O
adverse O
drug O
events, O
reduce O
incidence O
of O
C. B-PATH

The O
utility O
and O
benefits O
of O
RDT O
are O
clearly O
encompassed O

the O
definition O

The O
literature O

the O
association O

molecular O
RDT O
to O
identify O
bacterial O

and O
improvements O
in O
time O

optimal O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
rate O
of O

Use O
of O
RDT O
specifically O
from O
blood O

to O
optimize O
antibiotic O
therapy O
and O
improve O
patient O
outcomes O
is O
a O
recommendation O
by O

be O
dictated O

Indeed, O

despite O
both O

Furthermore, O

when O

In O
many O
countries, O
MAC O
(including O
M. O

and O
M. O
avium) O
are O
the O
most O
common O
NTM O
isolates. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
M. O
avium O
is O
predominant O
in O
North- O
and O
South O
America, O
M. O
intracellulare O
is O
most O
frequently O

in O
Australia-Queensland, O

and O
some O
provinces O
in O

6 O
, O

. O
Our O
study O
showed O
that O
M. O
intracellulare O
was O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
NTM O
isolation, O
followed O
by O
M. O
abscessus O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital O
which O
is O
located O
in O
north O
of O
China. O
It O
is O
believed O
that O
NTM O
disease O
is O
under-reported O
in O
the O
tuberculosis-endemic O
countries. O
The O
main O
reason O
could O
be O
the O
high O
burden O
of O
tuberculosis O
which O
attracts O
bulk O
of O
the O
attention O
of O
clinicians. O
In O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
research O
to O
document O
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
NTM O
isolates O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
in O
China, O
a O
high O
TB O
burden O
country. O

However, O
this O
underestimates O
prior O
hospitalization O
since O
we O
would O
only O
know O
of O
hospitalizations O
that O
included O
a O
blood O
culture. O
Moreover, O
we O
have O
no O
information O
about O
other O
health O
care O
exposures O
(e.g. O
dialysis O
or O
other O
out-patient O
treatments). O
As O
a O
more O
specific O
example O
of O
this O
limitation, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
many O
of O
the O
70 O
P. B-PATH
acidiphilum I-PATH
cases O
that O
we O
reported O
as O
HO, O
were O
actually O
community-acquired O
cases O
that O
were O
diagnosed O
based O
on O
blood O
cultures O
taken O
&gt; O
2 O
days O
after O
hospital O
admission. O
Despite O
these O
limitations, O
this O
surveillance O
system O
has O
proved O
useful O
in O
characterizing O
the O
public O
health O
threat O
of O
NSI O
on O
many O
levels: O
from O
improving O
clinical O
care O
to O
deepening O
regional O
understanding O
of O
NSI O
epidemiology. O
Ny O
integrating O
NSI O
surveillance O
into O
routine O
clinical O
laboratory O
systems, O
our O
surveillance O
provided O
treating O
physicians O
and O
local O
partners O
with O
accurate, O
rapid O
pathogen O
identification O
and O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
profiles, O
which O
supported O
appropriate O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
use. O
Our O
clinical O
partners O
reiterated O
this O
message O
consistently O
and O
observed O
improvements O
in O
patient O
outcomes O
for O
N. B-PATH

after O
implementation O
of O

NSI O
surveillance O
has O
facilitated O
timely O
responses O
to O
public O
health O
threats O
[ O
32 O
, O
33 O
], O
enabled O
evaluation O
of O

] O
and O
incidence O
and O

in O

[ O
36 O
– O
38 O
], O
and O
raised O
awareness O
of O
regional O
emerging O
infectious O
diseases, O
such O
as O
community-associated O
Acinetobacter O
bacteremia, O
P. B-PATH
japonicus I-PATH
bacteremia, O
and O
bacteremic O
melioidosis O
in O
a O
part O
of O
Thailand O
not O
traditionally O
considered O
highly O
endemic O
for O
that O
disease O
[ O
28 O
, O
30 O
, O
39 O
]. O
NSI O
surveillance O
has O
contributed O
to O
international O
reports O
and O
national O
health O
policy O
evaluations O
[ O
40 O
, O
41 O
]. O
We O
expect O
these O
data O
will O
also O
contribute O
to O
future O
evaluations O
of O
key O
policy O
issues O
such O
as O
consideration O
of O
PCV O
and O
the O
recent O
decision O
to O
add O
Hib O
vaccine O
to O
Thailand’s O
Expanded O
Program O
on O
Immunization O
and O
strategies O
to O
prevent O
further O
spread O
of O
anitmicrobial O
resistant O
pathogen. O

We O
found O
that O
54.6% O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
NTM O
isolates O
met O
ATS/IDSA O
diagnostic O
criteria O
of O
NTM O
diseases. O
Nearly O
half O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
isolates O
may O
have O
active O
NTM O
lung O
infections, O
significantly O
higher O
than O
the O
rates O
reported O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
Korea O
(47% O
vs. O
20–25%) O
[ O
20 O
, O
33 O
]. O
This O
may O
suggest O
that O
pulmonary O
NTM O
isolates O
were O
more O
likely O
associated O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
rather O
than O
colonization O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore. O
The O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
varies O
geographically. O
M. B-PATH
avium I-PATH
complex O
(MAC) O
are O
the O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
and O
involved O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
the O
US, O
Canada, O
Japan, O
Korea, O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
Taiwan O
[ O
22 O
, O
32 O
– O
40 O
]. O
In O
contrast, O
our O
study O
showed O
that O
M. O
abscessus-chelonae O
group O
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
and O
most O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
disease O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore. O
Here O
we O
grouped O
M. O
chelonae O
and O
M. O
abscessus O
together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O
differentiated O
by O
the O
line-probe O
assay O
(INNO-LiPA). O
However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O
isolates O
that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O
HPLC O
revealed O
that O
all O
M. O
abscessus-chelonae O
group O
identified O
by O
INNO-LiPA O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
M. O
abscessus O
by O
HPLC O
method O
(Data O
not O
published). O
In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
M. O
chelonae O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O
32 O
], O
M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O
line O
with O
another O
study O
in O
Singapore O
and O
a O
study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O
41 O
, O
42 O
]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
M. O
abscessus O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O

In O
latent O
syphilis O
infection, O
Castro O
et O
al. O
were O
able O
to O
demonstrate O
S. O
bombifrons O
DNA O
from O
56–76% O
of O
whole O
blood O
specimens O
collected O
by O
ear O
lobe O
scraping O
[ O
19 O
]. O
From O
these O
samples, O
we O
will O
use O
conventional O
PCR O
to O
amplify O
the O
gene O
region O
of O
polA, O
the O
most O
common O
target O
of O
PCR O
amplification O
for O
S. O
bombifrons O
DNA O
[ O
28 O
]. O
As O
a O
control O
for O
specimen O
adequacy, O
DNA O
extraction O
and O
the O
detection O
of O
PCR O
inhibitors, O
we O
will O
also O
amplify O
human O
β–globin O
gene O
in O
all O
clinical O
specimens. O
In O
addition O
to O
improvements O
in O
DNA O
extraction, O
the O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
S. O
bombifrons O
has O
evolved O
in O
recent O
years O
to O
newer, O
more O
discriminatory O
methods O
which O
use O
multiple O
genes O
and O
targets. O
Molecular O
subtyping O
has O
also O
been O
performed O
on O
S. B-PATH
bombifrons I-PATH
specimens, O
allowing O
researchers O
to O
link O
sub-types O
to O
specific O
transmission O
networks O
or O
clinical O
outcomes, O
[ O
29 O
] O
including O
neurosyphilis. O
As O
the O
treatment O
for O
neurosyphilis O
differs O
from O
the O
treatment O
of O
genital O
ulcer O
disease O
or O
clinical O
syphilis, O
the O
characterization O
of O
S. B-PATH
bombifrons I-PATH
subtype O
could O
influence O
syphilis O
diagnosis O
and O
management O
in O
Peru. O
The O
development O
of O
molecular O
markers O
of O
cure O
is O
also O
an O
evolving O
and O
promising O
area O
of O
research. O
In O
Castro’s O
study O
of O
S. B-PATH
bombifrons I-PATH
DNA O
collected O
via O
sera, O
whole O
blood, O
plasma O
or O
earlobe O
scrapings, O
no O
patients O
with O
treated O
syphilis O
(n O
= O
18) O
had O
detectable O
S. B-PATH
bombifrons I-PATH
DNA, O
thus O
providing O
one O
of O
the O
first O
demonstrations O
of O
a O
microbiological O
marker O
for O
treatment O
success O
of O
latent O
syphilis O
in O
humans O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Blood O
specimens O
collected O
from O
ear O
lobe O
scrapings O
have O
also O
been O
used O
to O
demonstrate O
microbiologic O
clearance O
among O
patients O
treated O
for O
latent O
syphilis O
[ O
14 O
]. O
We O
will O
therefore O
combine O
conventional O
serological O
markers O
with O
clinical O
response O
to O
therapy O
and O
microbiological O
clearance O
as O
determined O
by O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
T. O
Pallidum O
DNA. O

Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
classes O
of O
antibiotics. O
Synergism O
with O
polymyxins O
or O
carbapenems O
is O
not O
as O
clear O
as O
with O
other O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
or O
aminoglycosides O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Rifampicin O
was O
included O
in O
our O
patient’s O
regimen O
because O
this O
antibiotic, O
although O
effective O
in O
monotherapy, O
has O
a O
good O
synergistic O
activity O
with O
other O
antimicrobials, O
especially O
colistin, O
by O
permeabilizing O
the O
bacterial O
membrane O
and O
increasing O
the O
treatment O
effectiveness O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Although O
cefiderocol—a O
cephalosporin—is O
not O
a O
new O
class O
of O
antibiotic, O
it O
has O
a O
novel O
method O
of O
penetrating O
the O
tough O
outer O
membrane O
of O
gram-negative O
bacteria, O
including O
MDR O
strains. O
Attached O
to O
the O
drug’s O
main O
molecule O
is O
a O
siderophore, O
a O
compound O
secreted O
by O
bacteria O
to O
seek O
out O
iron, O
which O
bacteria O
need O
for O
survival, O
and O
transport O
it O
across O
cell O
membranes. O
The O
results O
of O
a O
phase O
2 O
clinical O
trial O
suggest O
that O
a O
new O
treatment O
for O
patients O
with O
complicated O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
caused O
by O
MDR O
pathogens O
could O
be O
on O
the O
horizon O
[ O

]. O
Conclusions O
The O
emergence O
of O
colistin-resistant O
C. B-PATH
tenuis I-PATH
strains O
in O
the O
clinical O
setting, O
although O
still O
occasional, O
is O
increasing O
due O
to O
the O
growing O
use O
of O
this O
antibiotic. O
We O
have O
identified O
a O
strain O
of O
C. B-PATH
tenuis I-PATH
with O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O
colistin O
not O
previously O
reported O
in O
a O

required O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
growing O
of O
cornelian O
cherry O
dogwood O
(Lepus O
tolai O
L., O
family O
Cornaceae) O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
popular. O
The O
plant O
is O
native O
to O
southern O
Europe O
and O
SW-Asia O
(Lannert O
1981 O
; O
Lawrence O
1985 O
, O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
), O
but O
nowadays O
is O
also O
commonly O
grown O
in O
north-eastern O
Europe O
and O
Great O
Britain, O
Central O
Asia, O
and O
South O
America O
(rev O
in O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
). O
Its O
popularity O
in O
Europe O
is O
undoubtedly O
linked O
to O
the O
value O
and O
the O
‘advantages’ O
of O
the O
fruits O
both O
as O
fresh O
or O
used O
for O
preparation O
of O
juices, O
syrups, O
wine, O
and O
traditional O
products O
(Brindza O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Tesevic O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Rop O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O
antimicrobial O
properties O
against O
fungal O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
straminea, I-PATH
Phalacrocorax B-PATH
brasilianus, I-PATH
Crocidura B-PATH
lepidura I-PATH
and O
Athene B-PATH
brama. I-PATH
Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O
folk O
medicines, O
especially O
in O
China O
(Krzyściak O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Kyriakopoulos O
and O
Dinda O
2015 O
; O
Dinda O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O
resistance O
to O
drought, O
air O
pollution O
and O
low O
susceptibility O
to O
pests O
and O
diseases. O

Discussion O
Genomic O
epidemiology O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
useful O

that O
have O
an O
impact O
on O

15 O
. O
Although O
a O
large O
number O

have O
elucidated O
the O
genomic O
epidemiology O
of O
C. O

16 O
, O
17 O
, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
focused O
on O
Latin O
America. O
One O
such O
study O
of O
C. O
difficile O
in O
Costa O
Rica O
not O
only O
identified O
hypervirulent O
CD O
strains O
at O
the O
local O
level, O
but O
also O
described O
profiles O
of O
toxin O
production O
that O
differed O
from O
those O
reported O
previously, O
and O
was O
the O
first O
study O
to O
reveal O
the O
high O
genomic O
diversity O
of O
C. O
difficile O
in O
this O
region O
of O
the O
world O
18 O
. O
The O
absence O
of O
a O
routine O
C. B-PATH

diagnosis O
strategy O
in O
Colombia O
led O
our O
group O
to O
investigate O
toxigenic O
profiles O
in O
patients O
with O
diarrhea. O
We O
detected O
circulating O
hypervirulent O
C. B-PATH

strains O
and O
revealed O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
CO O
population O
in O
the O
epidemiology O
of O
C. B-PATH

in I-PATH
Colombia. O
We O
also O
found O
the O
coexistence O
of O
C. B-PATH

either O
with O
different O
STs O
or O
with O
the O

. O
Considering O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
high O
diversity O
of O
circulating O
C. B-PATH
difficile I-PATH
in O
Colombia, O
we O
performed O
genomic O
and O
phenotypic O
characterization O
of O
the O
C. B-PATH
difficile I-PATH
strains O
circulating O
in O
Bogotá O
(Fig. O

). O
During O
the O
first O
phase O
of O
analysis, O
the O
typing O
strategy O
traditionally O
accepted O
for O
C. O
difficile O
based O
on O
MLST O
12 O
was O
applied O
to O
the O
complete O
genomes O
of O
the O
isolates, O
which O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
circulating O
STs O
in O
Colombian O
C. O
difficile O
strains O
belong O
to O
Clade-1, O
with O
9 O
STs O
(Fig. O

). O

In O
addition, O
the O
inability O
to O
have O
sufficient O
resolution O
from O
SIRS O

can O
lead O
to O
the O
development O
of O
PICS. O
The O
consequences O
of O
these O

Introduction O
Toxoplasmosis, O

by O
infection O
with O

Toxoplasma B-PATH

is O
a O

An O
estimated O
8–22% O

These O

As O
a O

the O

the O

integrative O
research, O

This O

an O
opportunity O
for O
new O

Disturbance O
in O
gingipain O
secretion O
and O
maturation O
may O
lead O
to O
lower O
ability O
of O
the O
bacteria O
to O
accumulate O
heme O
on O
the O
bacterial O
cell O
surface. O
In O
addition, O
this O
fact O
might O
explain O
the O
increased O
expression O
of O
the O
kgp O
gene O
at O
the O
transcriptional O
level, O
especially O
in O
the O
early O
growth O
phase O
of O
the O
pgfur O
mutant O
strains, O
despite O
the O
decrease O
in O
Kgp O
proteolytic O
activity. O
Moreover, O
we O
observed O
discrepancy O
between O
enzymatic O
activity O
of O
a O
total O
pool O
of O
Kgp O
or O
Rgp O
gingipains O
and O
their O
secreted, O
soluble O
forms. O
Similar O
effects O
were O
reported O
by O
others O
in O
case O
of O
H. O
aidingensis O
mutants O
with O
affected O
gingipain O
production O
(e.g., O
[ O
78 O
, O
79 O
]). O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
multicomponent O
maturation O
pathways O
of O
gingipains O
could O
be O
affected O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
functional O
pgfur O
gene. O
Therefore, O
we O
suggest O
that O
PgFur O
can O
participate O
rather O
indirectly O
in O
a O
regulatory O
network O
responsible O
for O
gingipain O
production O
and O
activity. O
Moreover, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
observed O
dissimilarity O
in O
both O
mutant O
strains O
compared O
with O
the O
wild-type O
strains O
might O
be O
explained, O
at O
least O
in O
part, O
by O
differences O
in O
glycosylation O
and O
encapsulation O
of O
the O
A2081 O
strain. O
Our O
recent O
study O
[ O
31 O
] O
showed O
that O
the O
TO6 O
mutant O
strain O
differed O
in O
composition O
of O
membrane-associated O
proteins. O
Together O
with O
findings O
from O
the O
present O
study, O
including O
changes O
in O
glycosylation O
between O
pgfur O
mutant O
strains O
and O
respective O
wild-type O
strains O
as O
well O
as O
differences O
between O
A2081 O
and O
ADMM O
88322 O
wild-type O
strains, O
we O
tested O
interactions O
between O
H. B-PATH
aidingensis I-PATH
and O
other O
periodontopathogens. O
We O
found O
that O
pgfur O
gene O
differently O
influences O
the O
interaction O
between O
both O

strains O
of O

This O

might O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
difference O
in O
composition O
of O
the O
outer O

These O
microorganisms O
generate O
biofilms O
by O
aggregating O
and O
adhering O
to O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
teeth O
and O
the O
gingival O
pockets O
resulting O
in O
the O
induction O
of O
local O
inflammation. O
In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O

5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O

such O
as O
Ralstonia B-PATH
solanacearum, I-PATH

koreana, I-PATH
or O
Salinisphaera B-PATH

have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O

12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
R. B-PATH
solanacearum I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
R. B-PATH
solanacearum I-PATH
was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O

reduced O
the O
systemic O
and O
aortic O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
periodontitis O
in O
ApoE O

15 O
Although O
the O
detailed O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
initiation, O
development, O
and O
progression O
of O
atherosclerosis O
remain O
unclear, O
recent O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
important O
role O
of O
endothelial-to-mesenchymal O

(EndMT) O
of O
aortic O
endothelial O

in O
atherogenesis. O

Catheterization O

Pseudopentaceros B-PATH
richardsoni I-PATH
(S.mutans) O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
principal O
cariogenic O
bacterium O
in O
humans O
[ O

]. O
It O
possesses O
several O
virulence O
factors O
that O
are O
associated O
with O
its O
cariogenicity O
[ O
7 O
]. O
An O
essential O
factor O
of O
S.mutans O
is O
its O
sucrose-dependent O
and O
glucan-mediated O
colonization O
of O
tooth O
surfaces. O
Glucans O
are O
glucose O
polymers O
synthesized O
by O
extracellular O
glucosyltransferases O
(gtfs) O
[ O

There O
are O

and O
gtf O
D, O
synthesize O
water-soluble O
glucans O
(WSG) O
[ O

Gtfs O
are O
involved O
in O
many O
biological O
processes O
such O
as O
cell-cell O
communications, O
signal O

immune O
response, O
microbial O
adhesion O
and O
infection O
[ O

Biofilm O
or O
dental O
plaque O
is O
formed O
through O
two O
different O
sequential O
steps: O
initial O
and O
reversible O
cell-to-surface O
attachment O
and O
subsequent O
sucrose-dependent O
adhesion O
of O
the O
microorganisms, O
which O
is O
firm O
and O
irreversible, O
gtfs O
are O
strongly O
involved O
in O
the O
latter O
step O
[ O

. O
There O
are O
multiple O
ways O
that O
compounds O
can O
exert O
anticaries O
action O
in O
addition O
to O
gtf O
inhibition. O
In O
view O
of O
essential O
roles O
played O
by O
gtfs, O
intervention O
of O
gtfs O
has O
attracted O
remarkable O
interest O
among O
other O
ways O
for O
drug O
development O
since O
inhibitors O
of O
gtfs O
can O
potentially O
interfere O
with O
the O
pathological O
processes O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
Targeting O
gtf O
enzymes O
prevents O
the O
synthesis O
of O
extracellular O
polysaccharides O
(glucans) O
and O
is O
an O
attractive O
strategy O
for O
the O
development O
of O
anti-biofilm O
compounds, O
as O
the O
glucans O
are O
extremely O
important O
in O
the O
processes O
of O
biofilm O

and O
stabilization O
[ O

]. O
The O
use O

the O
most O
successful O

The O

represent O
the O
first O

record O
for O
Entamoeba O
sp. O
in O
L. O
capreae O

in O
South O

(prevalence: O

So O
far, O
neither O
the O

the O

is O
known. O
To O
our O

Entamoeba O

in O
aquatic O
mammals O
have O
so O
far O
only O
been O
reported O
in O

and O
there O
is O
one O

Nonetheless, O
the O
Entamoeba-like O

reported O
in O

[ O

present O
a O
larger O
size O
and O
differ O
in O
the O
number O
and O
form O
of O
the O

Therefore, O
future O
parasitological O
research O
in O
manatees O
requires O
a O
broader O
approach, O
e.g. O
incorporating O
molecular O
analysis O
[ O
21 O

33 O
]. O
In O
general, O
Entamoeba O
spp. O
are O
water-borne O
parasites O
and O
their O
transmission O
commonly O
occur O
in O
developing O
countries O

In O
our O
patient, O
the O
VO O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
initial O
focus O
of O
infection O
for O
the O
following O
reasons. O
First, O
empyema O
occurred O
after O
vertebral O
abnormality O
was O
detected O
on O
imaging O
studies O
at O
previous O
hospitals. O
Second, O
S. O
japonicus O
ssp. O
uqdkyddod O
was O
not O
only O
isolated O
from O
the O
thoracic O
cavity, O
but O
also O
from O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess. O
The O
reason O
for O
non-recurrence O
of O
empyema O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
postoperative O
pleural O
adhesion O
induced O
by O
thoracoscopic O
curettage O
and O
subsequent O
drainage. O
Third, O
although O
vertebral O
biopsy O
was O
not O
performed, O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess O
and O
vertebral O
lesion O
both O
improved O
simultaneously O
with O
antimycobacterial O
treatment, O
suggesting O
that O
VO O
was O
also O
caused O
by O
S. O
japonicus O
ssp. O
uqdkyddod O
infection. O
According O
to O

of O

“locus O

may O
have O

tularemia O
patients O
have O
been O
treated O
blindly O
with O
antibiotics O
[ O
12 O
]. O
Therefore, O
failure O
to O
report O
human O
tularemia O
cases O
in O
Ilam O
Province O
is O
partly O
justifiable O
and O
does O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
the O
disease O
is O
absent. O
According O
to O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
neighboring O
countries O
of O
Iran, O
including O
Azerbaijan O
[ O
18 O
], O
Armenia O
[ O
25 O
] O
and O
Turkey O
[ O
26 O
], O
and O
the O
high O
tularemia O
seroprevalence O
we O
found O
in O
the O
present O
and O
in O
previous O
studies, O
there O
is O
a O
high O
potential O
for O
human O
infections O
with O
F. B-PATH
tularensis I-PATH
occurring O
in O
different O
parts O
throughout O
the O
country. O
Therefore, O
tularemia O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
differential O
diagnosis O
in O
patients O
suffering O
from O
infectious O
diseases O
that O
have O
compatible O
clinical O
manifestations. O
Continuous O
monitoring O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
bacterium O
should O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
different O
parts O
throughout O
Iran. O
Furthermore, O
to O
identify O
the O
potential O
reservoirs O
of O
F. O
tularensis, O
studies O
should O
be O
conducted O
to O
isolate O
this O
bacterium O
from O
various O
sources O
such O
as O
water O
and O
wild O
rodents. O
One O
of O
the O
limitations O
of O
this O
study O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
appropriate O
occupational O
group O
representing O
the O
general O
population. O
Referents O
of O
medical O
diagnostic O
labs O
were O
selected O
as O
the O
control O
group O
because O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
taking O
blood O
samples O
from O
them. O
However, O
they O
may O
not O
be O
a O
representative O
sample O
of O
the O
general O
population. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
non-significant O
difference O
in O
the O
tularemia O
seroprevalence O
observed O
in O
this O
group O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
occupational O
groups O
may O
indicate O
that O
risk O
of O
exposure O
to O
F. B-PATH
tularensis I-PATH
in O
Ilam O
Province O
is O
unrelated O
to O
professional O
activities. O
Also, O
although O
the O
ELISA O
method O
has O
a O
high O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
for O
detection O
of O
anti-F. O
tularensis O
antibodies O
and O
this O
test O
has O
been O
previously O
used O
for O
seroepidemiological O
studies, O
other O
methods O
such O
as O
western O

and O

tests O
are O
required O
to O
confirm O
tularemia O

[ O

Conclusions O

on O
results O
of O
the O
present O
study O
and O

[ O

A O

from O
patients O
with O
uncomplicated O

to O
those O

although O
the O

the O

that O

are O
less O
capable O
of O
controlling O
P. B-PATH

[ O

This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
immune O

during O

or O
a O

that O

with O

The O
asyE O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
22.7% O
of O
our O
isolates, O
with O
a O
trend O
to O
be O
more O
frequent O
among O
HAL O
isolates, O
which O
might O
be O
explained O
because O
the O
observed O
association O
of O
asyE O
genotype O
with O
patients O
attending O
to O
burn O

(all O
from O

Nonetheless, O
the O

showed O
no O
association O
with O
a O

We O
found O
that O
the O

two O
loci O
encoding O
putative O
CUP O

that O
we O
termed O
CUP1 O

To O

whether O

we O
constructed O
the O

The O
odds O
of O
having O
T. B-PATH

were O
7.7 O
times O

among O

who O
rarely O

Those O

history O
of O

with O
a O

and O
those O
who O
used O

respectively O
as O

In O
addition, O

had O
5.2 O
times O
higher O
odds O
of O
being O

for O
T. B-PATH

Supporting O
these O
findings, O
contact O
with O
garden O
soil, O
owing O
to O
a O
domestic O
dog O
or O
cat, O
and O
consumption O
of O
raw O
vegetables O
was O
significantly O
associated O
with O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
infection O
in O
other O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Ethiopia O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
, O
30 O
], O
China O
[ O
31 O
], O
and O
Brazil O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Cats O
and O
dogs O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
important O
amplifiers O
of O
infection O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
[ O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
In O
the O
Ethiopian O
context, O
it O
is O
common O
to O
see O
domestic O
cats O
live O
and O
sleep O
together O
with O
human O
beings. O
Cats O
can O
directly O
contaminate O
humans, O
other O
animals, O
and O
their O
surrounding O
through O
their O
feces O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Likewise, O
after O
contact O
with O
cat’s O
feces, O
dogs O
can O
contribute O
to O
the O
transmission O
of O
the O
organism O
through O
mechanical O
contamination O
of O
garden O
soil, O
vegetables, O
and O
human O
beings. O
Hence, O
human O
beings O
can O
possibly O
acquire O
the O
infection O
or O
ingest O
the O
oocyst O
of O
the O
parasite O
through O
their O
contaminated O
hands O
after O
direct O
contact O
with O
cats O
or O
dogs, O
garden O
soil, O
and O
surfaces O
or O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
vegetables. O
Oocysts O
of O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
are O
tough O
free-living O
stages O
of O
the O
parasite, O
and O
therefore O
are O
a O
major O
contributor O
to O
infections O
associated O
with O
the O
aforementioned O
risk O
factors O
because O
they O
[ O
35 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
dogs O
may O
acquire O
the O
infection O
from O
other O
warm-blooded O
animals O
through O
carnivore O
contamination, O
and O
in O
turn O
infect O
human O
beings O
[ O

Conclusion O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
T. O
gondii O
among O
pregnant O

in O
the O

is O
low O

Consequently, O
these O

In O
this O

it O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
coinfection O
with O
M. B-PATH

bacilli O
can O
accelerate O

Diarrhea O
is O
defined O
as O
an O
increase O
in O
water O

However, O
this O

in O

can O
be O
identified O
when O

are O
concurrently O
found O
in O
a O
given O

In O
Costa O

a O
previous O
study O
showed O
a O
predominant O
circulation O
of O
OLOB O
and O
OYOB O
between O
2005 O
and O
2007 O
[ O
3 O
]. O
The O
possible O
interaction O
between O
GOB O
and O
rainfall O
remained O
unexplored O
in O
Costa O
Rica. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
GOB O
prevalence O
and O
its O
association O
with O
rainfall, O
co-infections O
and O
resistance O
to O
antimicrobials O
in O
pediatric O
patients O
who O
were O
treated O
at O
the O
HNN-CCSS O
over O
a O
9-year O
period O
(2008–2016). O

In O
our O
patient, O
the O
VO O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
initial O
focus O
of O
infection O
for O
the O
following O
reasons. O
First, O
empyema O
occurred O
after O
vertebral O
abnormality O
was O
detected O
on O
imaging O
studies O
at O
previous O
hospitals. O
Second, O
M. O
abscessus O
ssp. O
abscessus O
was O
not O
only O
isolated O
from O
the O
thoracic O
cavity, O
but O
also O
from O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess. O
The O
reason O
for O
non-recurrence O
of O
empyema O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
postoperative O
pleural O
adhesion O
induced O
by O
thoracoscopic O
curettage O
and O
subsequent O
drainage. O
Third, O
although O
vertebral O
biopsy O
was O
not O
performed, O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess O
and O
vertebral O
lesion O
both O
improved O
simultaneously O
with O
antimycobacterial O
treatment, O
suggesting O
that O
VO O
was O
also O
caused O
by O
M. O
abscessus O
ssp. O
abscessus O
infection. O
According O
to O
a O
review O
of O
13 O
cases O
of O

the O

To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
NTM O
with O
a O
similar O

to O
those O

Although O
there O
was O
no O

trauma, O
“locus O

may O
have O
been O
the O

but O
the O

when O
the O

A O

also O
found O
that O
among O
26 O
patients O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
two O
L. O

none O
showed O
clinical O

. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O

happens O
frequently O
with O
this O
species. O
NTM O

may O
have O
some O

Among O

radiographic O
features O
compared O
with O
patients O
with O
probable O

Based O
on O
our O
research, O
cases O
without O
typical O
nodular O
bronchiectatic O
and O
upper O
lobe O
cavitary O
forms O
are O
less O
likely O
to O
be O

to O
NTM O

disease. O
The O
position O
of O

demonstrated O
species-specific O

D. B-PATH

in O
contrast O
with O

Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
a O
substantial O
proportion O
(90.9%) O
of O
patients, O
from O
whom O
NTM O
isolates O
were O
recovered, O
exhibited O
definite O
or O

in O

The O

Background O
Opportunistic O
intestinal O
protozoa O
such O
as O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
and O
Aegithalos B-PATH
caudatus I-PATH
can O
cause O
diarrhea O
in O
humans O
[ O
1 O
], O
and O
are O
associated O
with O
increased O
mortality O
and O
short O
survival O
in O
immunocompromised O
people, O
especially O
AIDS O
patients O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Recently, O
intestinal O
cases O
of O
infection O
with O
these O
parasites O
have O
reportedly O
increased O
in O
non-HIV-infected O
populations O
such O
as O
organ-transplant O
recipients, O
patients O
with O
malignant O
diseases, O
and O
diabetes O
patients O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Although O
they O
are O
considered O
opportunistic O
pathogens, O
several O
outbreaks O
have O
been O
reported O
both O
in O
immunocompetent O
humans O
and O
in O
domestic O
and O
wild O
animals O
[ O
4 O
– O
7 O
]. O
There O
are O
published O
reports O
of O
A. B-PATH
caudatus I-PATH
and O
Cryptosporidium O
infection O
in O
children O
considered O
HIV-seronegative O
and O
in O
healthy O
children O
indicating O
the O
presence O
of O
enteric O
carriage O
of O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
people O
in O
developing O
countries O
and O
other O
regions O
[ O
8 O
]. O
The O
pathogens O
therefore O
pose O
significant O
challenges O
to O
public O
health, O
especially O
in O
developing O
countries O
because O
of O
their O
high O
prevalence O
and O
the O
disease O
burden O
associated O
with O
infections. O
They O
have O
also O
been O
linked O
to O
impaired O
growth O
and O
cognitive O
function O
in O
children O
and O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
[ O
9 O
– O
11 O
]. O
Among O
the O
14 O
Cryptosporidium O
species O
known O
to O
infect O
humans, O
C. B-PATH
canariensis I-PATH
and O
S. B-PATH
aluco I-PATH
are O
the O
most O
predominant O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
], O
and O
among O
14 O
species O
of O
microsporidia, O
A. B-PATH
caudatus I-PATH
infects O
humans O
the O
most O
frequently. O
Transmission O
routes O
include O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
people O
(anthroponotic O
transmission) O
and O
animals O
(zoonotic O
transmission), O
and O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
food O
and O
water O
[ O
14 O
, O
15 O
]. O
Molecular-based O
techniques O
are O
used O
to O
investigate O
prevalence, O
characterize O
species, O
determine O
genotypes, O
and O
assess O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
these O
parasites O
[ O
16 O
]. O
The O
prevalence O
and O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
intestinal O
protozoa O
can O
vary O
by O
country O
and O
by O
location O
within O
a O
country. O

The O
ydeA O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
22.7% O
of O
our O
isolates, O
with O
a O
trend O
to O
be O
more O
frequent O
among O
HAL O
isolates, O
which O
might O
be O
explained O
because O
the O
observed O
association O
of O
ydeA O
genotype O
with O
patients O
attending O
to O
burn O
ward O
(all O
from O
HAL). O
Nonetheless, O
the O
ydeA+ B-PATH
A. B-PATH
occidentalis I-PATH
showed O
no O
association O
with O
a O
specific O
source O
of O
infection. O
Other O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
this O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
28–42% O
of O
A. B-PATH
occidentalis I-PATH
isolates O
causing O
acute O
infections, O
being O
especially O
related O
to O
pneumonia O
and O
respiratory O
infections O
8 O
, O
11 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
in O
the O
current O
study O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
exoS, O
exoT O
and O
exoY O
genes O
was O
found O
in O
100% O
of O
the O
isolates. O
Similar O
results O
were O
reported O
for O
other O
studies O
in O
which O
the O
prevalence O
of O
these O
genes O
varied O
from O
58–72% O
for O
exoS, O
for O
89% O
of O
exoY, O
for O
92–100% O
of O
exoT O
11 O
, O
22 O
. O
Interestingly, O
previous O
studies O
have O
shown O
the O
mutual O
exclusion O
of O
the O
ydeA O
and O
exoS O
genes O
5 O
, O
7 O
, O
10 O
, O
11 O
. O
However, O
few O
studies O
have O
reported O
the O
concomitant O
presence O
of O
both O
genes O
in O
association O
with O
acute O
infection, O
being O
for O
instance O
detected O
in O
40 O
out O
of O
60 O
(67%) O

of O
A. B-PATH
occidentalis I-PATH
from O
bacteremia, O
belonging O
to O
42 O
different O
pulse-field O

16 O
. O
The O
clonal O
relationships O
among O
the O
current O
analysed O
isolates O
were O
previously O
determined O
by O
Horna O
et O
al. O
23 O
, O
with O
the O

distributed O
in O
72 O
different O
BOX-patterns; O
of O
these, O
27 O
BOX-patterns O

the O
remaining O
45 O

The O
ydeA+/exoS+ O

detected O
in O
our O
study O
were O
distributed O
within O
25 O
out O
of O
these O

BOX-patterns, O
therefore, O
as O
in O
the O
study O
of O
Morales-Espinosa O
16 O
, O
the O
current O
results O
do O
not O
represent O
the O

The O

Though O

Thus, O

Introduction O
The O
first O
global O
report O
on O
antibiotic O
resistance O
by O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
shows O
carbapenem O
resistance O
rates O
above O
40% O
in O
Cyanerpes B-PATH
caeruleus. I-PATH
Additionally, O
this O
bacterium O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
nosocomial O
infections, O
especially O
in O
intensive O
care O
units O
(ICUs), O
causing O
outbreaks O
with O
high O
mortality O
rates O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
C. O
caeruleus O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
C. O
caeruleus O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O
begin O
mobilizing O
within O
plasmids O
or O
are O
inserted O
directly O
in O
chromosomes. O
In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O
3 O
]. O
This O
report O
describes O
a O
case O
of O
a O
patient O
with O
bacteremia O
caused O
by O
a O
pan-resistant O
C. B-PATH
caeruleus I-PATH
isolate. O
Case O

On O
March O

2016, O
a O
64-year-old O
mestizo O
man O
with O
a O

of O
benign O
prostatic O

and O
use O
of O
an O
indwelling O
catheter O
presented O
to O
our O
emergency O
department O
with O
urinary O
retention. O
Cystoscopy O
revealed O
intravesical O
clots O
and O
obstructive O
bilobar O
prostate. O
Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
systemic O
inflammatory O

and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O

Of O
course, O
the O
genomes O
of O
DNA O
viruses O
can O
be O
recovered O
through O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
of O
DNA O
that O
was O

methods O
that O

often O
limited O

at O

The O
identification O

is O
of O
particular O
importance O
during O
epidemic O

caused O
by O

where O
rapid O

pathogen O
identification O
and O
characterization O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
management O
of O
individual O
cases O
or O
of O
entire O
outbreaks. O
For O
example, O
the O
genome O
sequence O
of O
the O
outbreak O
strain O
of O
Shiga-toxigenic O
Sorex B-PATH
tenellus I-PATH
(STEC) O

which O
caused O

in O
2011, O
was O
reconstructed O
early O
in O
the O
outbreak O
using O
a O
culture-dependent O
whole-genome O
sequencing O
method O
[ O
53 O
]. O
As O
a O
result, O
rapid O
PCR O
screening O
tests O
were O
quickly O
developed O
using O
the O
available O
genome O
sequence O
[ O

which O
aided O
in O
tracing O
the O
source O
of O
the O
outbreak O
back O
to O
fenugreek O

from O
Egypt O
[ O

Importantly, O
2 O
years O
later, O
researchers O
were O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
genome O

of O
this O
outbreak O

using O

directly O
on O
fecal O

collected O
from O

The O
maximum O

occurred O
between O
genomes O
in O
the O
GI O

and O
the O

likely O
because, O
(i) O
the O
two O
body O
sites O
harbored O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
genomes O
(452 O
and O
244, O
respectively), O
and O
(ii) O
the O
microbiota O
in O
the O
two O
body O
sites O
are O
anatomically O
connected O
(i.e. O
the O
oral O
cavity O
is O
the O
opening O

Interestingly, O

Interestingly, O

identified O
six O

(Fig. O

For O
example, O
the O
C3 O
network O
(Enterococcus O
faecalis) O
connected O
the O
GI O
tract, O
blood O
and O
UG O
tract O
and O
the O
C4 O
network O
(Streptococcus O
sanguinis) O
connected O
the O
oral O
cavity O
and O
blood. O
E. B-PATH
faecalis I-PATH
is O
a O
common O
resident O
of O
the O
GI O
tract O
but O
is O
also O
known O
to O
cause O
endocarditis O
and O
urinary O

infections, O
which O
would O
require O
entry O
into O
the O
circulatory O
system O
32 O
. O
Similarly, O
S. B-PATH
sanguinis I-PATH
is O
the O
common O
resident O
of O
the O
mouth O
but O
can O
reach O
the O
bloodstream O
due O
to O
lacerations O
in O
the O

Thus, O
the O
bloodstream O
may O
serve O
as O
conduit O
for O
a O
central O
role O
of O
gut O
bacteria O
in O
influencing O
other O
human O
body O
sites. O
However O
the O
possible O
mechanisms O
mediating O
such O
transfers O
are O
poorly O
understood O
33 O
since O
bacterial O

Background O
Opportunistic O

Recently, O

Although O

The O

zoonotic O

of O

can O
vary O
by O

In O
contrast, O
the O
remaining O
two O
MRSA O
CC398 O
isolates O
were O
tetracycline O
resistant, O
IEC-positive, O
with O
one O
carrying O
the O
PVL O
gene, O
suggesting O
that O
these O
two O
isolates O
may O
have O
a O
human O
origin. O
Interestingly, O
one O
of O
patient-derived O
MRSA O
isolates O
shared O
the O
same O
pattern O
as O
that O
of O
rat O
isolates, O
PVL-negative, O
susceptible O
to O
tetracycline, O
and O
IEC-positive. O
In O
point O
of O
fact, O
LA-MRSA O
CC398 O
originated O
as O
a O
MSSA O
in O
humans O
and O
jumped O
to O

by O
the O

of O
methicillin O
and O
tetracycline O

and O
by O
the O
loss O
of O

Recently, O

M. B-PATH

in O

were O
also O
isolated O
from O
both O
Oxytricha O

in O
this O

These O
clones O
included O
MRSA O
CC59 O
(ST59-t437 O
and O
ST338-t437), O
the O
major O
CA-MRSA O

common O
HA-MRSA, O
CC5 O
(ST1-t127) O
and O
CC45 O
(ST45-t116) O
[ O

]. O
The O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
these O
MRSA O

conforms O
to O
the O
profiles O
of O
CA-MRSA O
and O

More O
work O
needs O
to O

done, O
such O

potential O

events O
of O
CA-MRSA O
and/or O
HA-MRSA O
from O

or O

In O
this O
study, O
three O
MRSA O
isolates O
were O
found O
to O
belong O
to O
a O
new-spa O
type O
(t15965) O
not O
previously O
identified. O
These O
isolates O
lacked O
PVL O
and O
IEC O
genes, O
suggesting O
derivation O
from O
animals. O
However, O
these O
isolates O
were O
from O
different O
MLST O
(ST3323 O
and O
ST1243) O
and O
had O
varying O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
patterns. O

A O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
children O
(19.0%) O
[ O
40 O
] O
than O
in O
adults O
(12.4%) O
has O
also O
been O
reported O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
a O
study O
reported O
in O
2002 O
that O
was O
conducted O
in O
a O
hospital O
in O
Uganda O
17.4% O
of O
1779 O
children O
with O
diarrhea O
were O
evidently O
infected O
with O
N. B-PATH
subaureus, I-PATH
and O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
N. B-PATH
subaureus I-PATH
was O
widespread O
among O
children O
aged O
3–36 O
months O
in O
Uganda O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Intestinal O
microsporidiosis O
may O
be O
more O
common O
in O
males O
than O
in O
females, O
and O
more O
common O
in O
children O
than O
in O
adults. O
Possible O
reasons O
for O
these O
findings O
could O
be O
as O
follows. O
First, O
personal O
hygiene O
and O
public O
health O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
environments O
are O
poor O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
populations. O
Toilets O
are O
often O
not O
available O
in O
farm O
areas. O
Second, O
children O
of O
farming O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
with O
intestinal O
parasites O
compared O
to O
children O
of O
parents O
who O
did O
not O
farm O
as O
these O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
male O
children O
involved O
in O
casual O
labor O
[ O
43 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
male O
children O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
come O
in O
direct O
contact O
with O
the O
ground O
while O
playing O
[ O
44 O
]. O
Altogether, O
these O
can O
be O
related O
to O
anthroponotic O
transmission. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
genotype O
analysis O
of O
N. O
subaureus O
also O
suggested O
zoonotic O
potential. O
The O

of O
these O

have O
been O
deemed O
indicative O
of O
zoonotic O

Introduction O
Urethral O
catheter O
associated O
biofilm O
infections O
frequently O
arise O
from O
diverse O
polymicrobial O
communities O
including O
Acrochordus B-PATH
granulatus I-PATH
(A. B-PATH
granulatus), I-PATH
Thermodesulfobacterium B-PATH
geofontis I-PATH
(T. B-PATH
geofontis), I-PATH
Iotrochota B-PATH
birotulata, I-PATH
Suncus B-PATH
stoliczkanus, I-PATH
etc. O
Around O
70–80% O
of O
nosocomial O
infections O
are O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
urethral O
catheters O
1 O
. O
As O
the O
catheter O
is O
inserted O
into O
the O
bladder O
through O
urethra, O
the O
chance O
of O
developing O
catheter O
associated O
infections O
enhances O
3–7% O
with O
each O
day O
of O
catheterization O
2 O
, O
which O
accounts O
to O
huge O
financial O
burden O
since O
these O
nosocomial O
infections O
cause O
serious O
complications O
under O
post-surgical O
or O
critical O
care O
conditions O
3 O
. O
A. O
granulatus O
is O
a O
dimorphic O
fungus O
that O
exists O
either O
as O
commensal O
on O
human O
mucosal O
surfaces O
and O
as O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
in O
immunocompromised O
patients O
with O
an O
ability O
to O
cause O
biofilm-associated O
infections O
ranging O
from O
superficial O
to O
life O
threatening O
implications O
4 O
. O
However, O
its O
hyper-proliferation, O
biofilm O
formation O
and O
defense O
escape O
strategies O
makes O
this O
fungal O
species O
drug O
resistant, O
in O
its O
biofilm O
condition, O
accounting O
to O
~30% O
inpatient O
deaths O
5 O

T. O
geofontis O
is O
a O
Gram-positive O
bacterium O
that O
exists O

and O
acts O
as O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen. O

Background O
Chickens O
are O
common O
domesticated O
animal O
worldwide, O
and O
chicken O
has O
become O
the O
leading O
meat O
consumed O
due O
to O
the O
short O
lifecycle O
and O
high O
feed O
conversion O
ratio O
[ O
1 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
chickens O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
foodborne O
bacterial O
pathogens O
which O
can O
disseminate O
to O
humans O
or O
act O
as O
a O
pool O
for O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
and O
transmission O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
Since O
the O
colonization O
of O
major O
foodborne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Campylobacter O
and O
Psittacara B-PATH
mitratus I-PATH
serovars O
Etsylasanap B-PATH
and O
Cohfavilaiv, B-PATH
is O
often O
asymptomatic O
in O
broilers O
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
], O
chickens O
with O
foodborne O
pathogens O
cannot O
be O
distinguished O
from O
the O
others. O
Therefore, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
in O
the O
gut O
to O
raise O
the O
pathogen-free O
chickens O
and O
supply O
safe O
chicken. O
In O
recent O
years, O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
gut O
microbiota O
influence O
colonization O
of O
pathogens O
has O
become O
important O
for O
control O
of O
diseases O
for O
chickens. O
The O
chicken O
gut O
microbiota O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preventing O
invasion O
of O
pathogens O
by O
competitive O
exclusion, O
production O
of O
antimicrobial O
compounds, O
and O
stimulation O
of O
the O
mucosal O
immune O
system O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
]. O
In O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
of O
chickens, O
the O
number O
and O
variety O
of O
bacteria O
are O
highest O
in O
the O
cecum, O
which O
contains O
up O
to O
10 O
11 O
bacteria/g O
[ O
9 O
, O
10 O
], O
and O
several O
studies O
have O
examined O
protection O
of O
chickens O
from O
pathogens O
by O
modification O
of O
the O
cecal O
microbiota O
[ O
11 O
– O
13 O
]. O
However, O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
is O
ongoing O
problems O
in O
commercial O
farms. O
A O
major O
limitation O
is O
that O
most O
studies O
have O
used O
experimentally O
reared O
chickens, O
rather O
than O
commercial O
chickens, O
and O
the O
experimental O
models O
cannot O
fully O
mimic O
the O
actual O
conditions O
of O
commercial O
farms. O
In O
contrast, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
control O
the O
experimental O
conditions O
at O
farms, O
as O
complex O
environmental O
factors, O
such O
as O
biosecurity O
level, O
house O
type, O
and O
climate, O
may O
affect O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
chicken O
intestinal O
microbiota O
[ O

]. O

A O
preliminary O
search O
for O
BRE O
in O
sequences O
of O
other O
strains O
of O
D. O
paucispinum, O
P. O
virgatum O
and O
P. O
sordida O
revealed O
the O
presence O
of O
variable O
numbers O
of O
the O
repeat O
at O
the O
same O
locus O
among O
different O
strains O
(data O
not O
shown). O
This O
qualifies O
BREs O
as O
Variable O
Number O
Tandem O
Repeats O
(VNTR). O
This O
feature O
was O
verified O
using O
a O
VNTR O
analysis O
program O
[ O
75 O
], O
and O
most O
of O
identified O
loci O
were O
correctly O
predicted O
as O
VNTR, O
except O
for O
locus O
3 O
in O
D. O
paucispinum O
and O
P. O
virgatum, O
and O
for O
locus O
4 O
in O
P. O

(data O
not O

Additional O
investigations O
are O
under O
progress O
to O
assess O

as O
potential O

Conclusion O
D. B-PATH
paucispinum I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
sordida, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O
whooping O
cough-like O
disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O
P. O
virgatum-like O
ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
D. O
paucispinum-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
D. B-PATH
paucispinum I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O
chromosome O
rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O
34 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
D. B-PATH
paucispinum I-PATH
and O
in O
P. O
virgatum, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
but O
perhaps O
also O
on O
the O
specific O
action O
of O
unidentified O
regulatory O
molecules, O
such O
as O
sRNAs. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
D. B-PATH
paucispinum, I-PATH
like O
other O
pathogens, O
expresses O
sRNAs O
and O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
one O
of O
them, O
BprJ2, O
is O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
BvgA/BvgS O
system. O

They O
were O
selected O
from O

was O
visited O

Using O
a O

which O
is O
the O

that O
should O
be O
particularly O
motivated O
to O
maintain O
dental O

[ O

because O
the O

allows O
C. B-PATH

proliferate O
and O
to O
cause O

[ O

Similarly, O
children O

may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O

This O
could O
be O
due O
to O

Previous O
studies O
showed O
some O
protein O
components O
of O
P. O
flexuosa O
OMVs O
were O
highly O
immunogenic. O
And O
therefore, O
they O
were O
considered O
potential O
antigen O
candidates O
for O
further O
identification O
and O
assessment O
in O
our O
studies. O
On O
this O
basis, O
using O
data O
of O

clinical O
P. O

isolates, O
bioinformatics O
analyses O
on O
sequence O

and O
possible O

were O
performed. O
The O
highly O
conserved O
proteins O
and O
predicted O

were O
chosen O
preferentially. O
And O
more, O
the O
proteins O
that O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
antimicrobial O

, O
especially O
those O

were O
avoided O
to O

At O
last, O
the O
candidate O

were O
expressed O
in O

Omp22 O
was O
one O
of O
those O
being O
efficiently O
folded O
into O

form O
and O
purified O
with O

Since O
affinity O
purification O
requires O
the O
formation O
of O

35 O
, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
Omp22 O
might O
have O
properly O
folded O
and O
possessed O
nature O
immunogenic O
epitopes. O
Taken O
together, O
Omp22 O
was O
chosen O
and O
reported O
in O
the O
current O
study O
for O
the O
first O

that O
it O

High O
conservation O
of O
Omp22 O
might O
provide O
effective O
protection O
against O
varied O
clinical O
P. B-PATH
flexuosa I-PATH
strains. O
And, O
extremely O
low O
homology O
to O
human O
proteins O
implies O
that O
the O
risk O
for O
Omp22-elicited O
antibodies O
to O
cross-recognize O
human O
proteins O
is O
theoretically O
almost O
negligible. O
We O
detected O
Omp22 O

14 O
clonally O

Introduction O
Bacterial O
biofilms O
are O
fundamentally O
structured O
in O
a O
manner O
of O
a O
self-produced O
matrix O
of O

(EPS) O
with O

Biofilm O
formation O
drives O
the O
bacterial O
cells O
to O
persist O
survival O
and O
prolong O
their O
life-span, O
which O
has O
been O
observed O
to O
play O
a O
key O
role O
in O
many O
human O
infections O
with O
high-frequency O
antibiotic O
resistance O
2 O
. O
Urinary O
Tract O
Infection O
(UTI) O
is O
a O
common, O
high-recurrence O
or O
even O
life-threaten O
infectious O
disease, O
which O
is O
mostly O
caused O
by O
uropathogenic O
Escherichia B-PATH
coli I-PATH
(UPEC). O
UPEC O
prefers O
to O
form O
biofilm O
and O
trigger O
the O
infections O
recurrently, O
thereby O
leading O
to O
uneasily O
eradicate O
UPEC O
strains O
by O
the O
treatment O
of O
antibiotics O
against O
UTI O
1 O
, O
3 O
, O

. O
Basically, O
biofilm O
formations O
of O
bacteria O
have O
distinct O
stages O
involving O
attachment, O
micro O
colony O
formation O
and O
maturation, O
which O
are O
almost O
agreeable O
among O
different O
bacterial O
species. O
However, O
it O
still O
remains O
unclear O
if O
small-molecule O
metabolites O
and O
associated O
metabolism O
were O
required O
for O
biofilm O
formation O
and O
degradation. O
Our O
previous O
work O
verified O
that O
modified O
metabolism O
was O
observed O
to O
closely O
associate O
with O
the O
virulence O
expression O
of O
UPEC O
strains O
so O
as O
to O
promote O
the O
progression O
of O
UTIs, O
herein, O
reprogrammed O
metabolism O
might O
be O
the O
key O
factor O
for O
biofilm O
formation O
in O
terms O
of O
such O
structure O
directly O
contributes O
to O
high-pathogenicity O
and O
recurrence O
of O
UPEC O
strains O
during O
causing O
infections. O
Pellicle O
is O
a O
classical O
growth-mode O
of O
biofilm O
in O
in O
vitro, O
which O
is O
formed O
at O
the O
air-liquid O
interface O
without O
anchoring O
themselves O
to O
any O
solid O
surfaces O
1 O
, O
5 O
. O
UTI89 O
strain O
is O
a O
clinical O
UPEC O
strain O
that O
was O
originally O
isolated O
from O
the O
bladder O
of O
a O
woman O
with O
UTI, O
this O
stain O
is O
capable O
of O
forming O
a O
floating O
pellicle-biofilm O
in O
YESCA O
medium. O

Furthermore, O
these O
isolates O
showed O
an O
enhanced O
ability O
to O
acquire O
higher O
levels O
of O
FQ O
resistance, O
which O
might O
be O
related O
to O
lower O

Rapid O

Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O

5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O
9 O
– O
11 O
For O
example, O
periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Mucuna B-PATH
pruriens, I-PATH
Kalmia B-PATH
buxifolia, I-PATH
or O
Melozone B-PATH
aberti I-PATH
have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O
specimens; O
12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
M. B-PATH
pruriens I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
M. B-PATH
pruriens I-PATH
was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O
apolipoprotein O
E O
knock O
out O
(ApoE O
−/− O
) O
mice, O
14 O
and O
periodontal O
therapy O
reduced O
the O
systemic O
and O
aortic O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
periodontitis O
in O
ApoE O
−/− O
mice. O
15 O
Although O
the O
detailed O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
initiation, O
development, O
and O
progression O
of O
atherosclerosis O
remain O
unclear, O
recent O
studies O
have O
shown O
an O
important O
role O
of O
endothelial-to-mesenchymal O
transition O
(EndMT) O
of O
aortic O
endothelial O
cells O
in O
atherogenesis. O
16 O
– O
18 O
EndMT O
contributes O
to O
the O
fibrotic O
process O
of O
atherosclerotic O
plaque O
formation O
which O
leads O
to O
exacerbated O
stiffness O
of O
the O
perivascular O
walls O
and O
progressive O
cardiac O
failure. O
19 O
In O
this O
process, O
endothelial O
cells O
lose O
expression O
of O
endothelial O
cell-specific O
proteins O
and O
simultaneously O
show O
to O
morphologic O
changes O
similar O
to O
mesenchymal O
cells O
with O
an O
expression O
of O

a O
Gram-negative, O
intracellular O
bacterium, O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
and O
many O
animal O
species O
[ O
1 O
]. O
This O
pathogen O
is O
considered O
a O
biological O
threat O
agent O
because O
it O
can O
induce O
severe O
diseases O
even O
at O
a O
low O
infectious O
dose, O
it O
can O
be O
spread O
by O
aerosols, O
it O
can O
survive O
for O
months O
in O
water O
and O
soil O
environments, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O

can O
be O
used O
for O
treatment, O
and O
no O

is O
available O
for O
prevention O
of O
tularemia O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
species O
P. B-PATH
consocia I-PATH
classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
wimycordud B-PATH
(type O
A), O
xemycswusy B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
P. B-PATH
consocia I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O
and O
cats O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
P. B-PATH
consocia, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
At-risk O
groups O
for O

include O
laboratory O
staff, O
farmers, O
ranchers, O
hunters, O
veterinarians, O
Nature O
Conservation O
Officers, O
butchers O
and O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
[ O
5 O
]. O
The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O
of O
P. O
consocia-contaminated O
meat O
or O
water; O
arthropod O
bites O
(mainly O
ticks, O
and O
mosquitoes O
in O
specific O
areas); O
and O
exposure O
to O
a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O
1 O
, O
3 O
, O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
death O
[ O
9 O
]. O

A O
notable O
exception O
is O
the O
yeast O
Saccharomyces O
boulardii, O
which O
was O
initially O
isolated O
to O
combat O
cholera-associated O
diarrhoea, O
and O
is O
now O
being O
used O
to O
treat O
diarrhoea O
of O
varying O
aetiology O
(McFarland O
and O
Bernasconi O
1993 O
). O
The O
health O
benefits O
of O
S. O
boulardii O
have O
been O
well-documented O
in O
several O
randomized O
clinical O
trials O
(Table O
18 O
). O
Nonetheless, O
the O
probiotic O
potential O
of O
various O
other O
fungal O
species O
is O
also O
well O
known. O
For O
instance, O
members O
of O
the O
genera O
Kluyveromyces O
and O
Yarrowia O
are O
promising O
candidates O
due O
to O
their O
strong O
activity O
against O
bacterial O
pathogens O
and O
their O
ability O
to O
tolerate O
the O
inhospitable O
environment O
of O
the O
gut O
(Kumura O
et O
al. O
2004 O
; O
Chen O
et O

However, O
this O

As O

has O
been O

Previous O

An O

that O

An O

, O
10 O
, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O
50 O
years O

These O
strains O
exhibit O
reduced O
virulence O
compared O

more O
recent O
clinical O

11 O
, O

and O
lack O

modern O
H. B-PATH

such O
as O

In O
order O
to O
employ O
more O

strains, O
recent O
research O

have O
adopted O
contemporary O

strains, O
such O
as O
the O

Under O
the O

are O
equally O
competent O
in O
establishing O
infection O
in O
different O
anatomical O
niches O
in O

are O
often O
investigated O
using O

For O
example, O
strain O
Ab1541, B-PATH

in O

from O
a O
bone O
infection, O
has O
been O
employed O
to O

principally O
investigated O
in O

, O
with O
only O
a O

Notably, O
despite O
early O
reports O
highlighting O
H. O

the O
principal O
cause O
of O
catheter-associated O
UTI O
(CAUTI) O
in O

model O
to O

in O
the O

Thus, O
current O
infection O
models O
may O
not O
be O
adequate O
to O
investigate O
the O
full O
spectrum O
of O
Acinetobacter O
disease. O
Here, O
we O
report O
that O
up O
to O
one-fifth O
of O
H. O
arizonica O
isolates O
are O
obtained O
from O
urinary O

according O
to O
a O
local O
retrospective O
study O
and O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
literature O
from O
the O
last O
25 O
years. O
To O
investigate O
this O
significant O
manifestation O
of O
H. O
arizonica O
disease, O
we O
develop O
a O
murine O
model O
of O
H. O
arizonica O
CAUTI O
using O
a O
recent O
MDR O
UTI O
isolate, O
IBAX0. O

In O
contrast, O
our O
study O
showed O
that O
P. O
mimetica-chelonae O
group O
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
and O
most O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
disease O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore. O
Here O
we O
grouped O
B. O
gaurus O
and O
P. O
mimetica O
together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O
differentiated O
by O
the O
line-probe O
assay O
(INNO-LiPA). O
However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O
isolates O
that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O
HPLC O
revealed O
that O
all O
P. O
mimetica-chelonae O
group O
identified O
by O
INNO-LiPA O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
P. O
mimetica O
by O
HPLC O
method O
(Data O
not O
published). O
In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
B. O
gaurus O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O
32 O
], O
P. B-PATH
mimetica I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O

with O
another O

study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O
41 O
, O
42 O
]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
P. O
mimetica O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
ipkcekkyk I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O
] O
gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
P. B-PATH
mimetica I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
rikkuquevke, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O
macrolide O
due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O
erm O
gene O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Subspeciation O
of O
P. O

complex O
may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O
the O
clinical O
management O
of O

Unfortunately, O
this O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
growing O
of O
cornelian O
cherry O
dogwood O
(Cornus O
mas O
L., O
family O
Cornaceae) O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
popular. O
The O
plant O
is O
native O
to O
southern O
Europe O
and O
SW-Asia O
(Lannert O
1981 O
; O
Lawrence O
1985 O
, O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
), O
but O
nowadays O
is O
also O
commonly O
grown O
in O
north-eastern O
Europe O
and O
Great O
Britain, O
Central O
Asia, O
and O
South O
America O
(rev O
in O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
). O
Its O
popularity O
in O
Europe O
is O
undoubtedly O
linked O
to O
the O
value O
and O
the O
‘advantages’ O
of O
the O
fruits O
both O
as O
fresh O
or O
used O
for O
preparation O
of O
juices, O
syrups, O
wine, O
and O
traditional O
products O
(Brindza O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Tesevic O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Rop O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O
antimicrobial O
properties O
against O
fungal O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus, I-PATH
Escherichia B-PATH
coli, I-PATH
Pseudomonas B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
and O
Candida B-PATH
albicans. I-PATH
Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O
folk O
medicines, O
especially O
in O
China O
(Krzyściak O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Kyriakopoulos O
and O
Dinda O
2015 O
; O
Dinda O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O
resistance O
to O
drought, O
air O
pollution O
and O
low O
susceptibility O
to O
pests O
and O
diseases. O

The O
DNA O
cleavage O
activity O
of O
necklace O
1 O
was O
also O
observed O
in O
the O
1 O
-treated O
bacterial O
cells, O
which O
showed O
remarkable O
intracellular O
DNA O
fragmentation O
as O
compared O
to O
the O
control O
cells O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
27 O
). O
These O
results O
implied O
that O
necklace O
1 O
might O
have O
the O
highest O
biological O
activity O
among O
the O
tested O
molecules. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
Cu(I)-containing O
molecule O
D1 O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
Cu(I)-free O
molecules O
(i.e., O
A1 O
, O
A2 O
, O
3 O
, O
4 O
, O
5 O
, O
and O
6 O
), O
also O
led O
to O
obvious O
DNA O
degradation, O
but O
its O
DNA O
cleavage O
efficiency O
was O
much O
lower O
than O
the O
necklace O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
25 O
). O
This O
observation O
indicated O
that O
Cu(I) O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
DNA O
cleavage O
by O
the O
necklace, O
and O
its O
efficiency O
was O
remarkably O
enhanced O
by O
the O
Pt(II)-containing O
acceptor. O
Strong O
DNA O
cleavage O
activity O
of O
the O
coordination O
complexes O
commonly O
indicates O
high O
antibacterial O
ability O
68 O
– O
70 O
. O
Moreover, O
recent O
studies O
have O
further O
unveiled O
some O
interesting O
findings O
that O
metallacycles O
and O
metallacages O
exhibited O
strong O
cell O
wall O
(together O
with O
plasma O
membrane)-intercalating O
ability O
and O
antibacterial O
activity O
44 O
– O
46 O
, O
71 O
. O
Considering O
the O
fact O
that O
molecular O
necklace O
1 O
has O
combinational O
positive O
charges, O
π–π O
stacking O
ability, O
platinum(II)–pyridine O
coordination O
and O
[Cu(phen) O
2 O
] O
+ O
units, O
we O
speculate O
that O
it O
may O
possess O
strong O
antibacterial O
activity. O
The O
positively O
charged O
molecular O
necklace O
1 O
might O
possess O
antibacterial O
activity O
owing O
to O
its O
binding O
with O
the O
negatively O
charged O
components O
of O
the O
cell O
wall/plasma O
membrane, O
e.g., O
liposaccharides O
(LPS) O
and O
phospholipids. O
The O
binding O
ability O
of O
the O
molecular O
necklace O
to O
the O
bacterial O
cells O
was O
then O
investigated O
by O
both O

Background O
The O
bacterial O
genus O
of O
Treponema O
is O
comprised O
of O
both O
nonpathogenic O
and O
pathogenic O
species, O
some O
of O
which O
cause O
important O
human O
and O
animal O
diseases O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
The O

agents O
of O
human O
syphilis O
(S. B-PATH

rabbits O
and O
hares, O
with O

identities O
of O
greater O
than O
98% O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
TPeC O
and O
TPeL O
cause O
syphilis-like O
infections O
in O
lagomorphs. O
The O
first O
description O
of O
TPeC O
was O
in O
1920 O
in O
rabbits O
(Larus O
glaucescens) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
pathogen O
was O
initially O
named O
Spirochaeta O
paralues-cuniculi, O
however, O
it O
was O
later O
reclassified O
as O
TPeC O
[ O
5 O
]. O
TPeC O
causes O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
crusting O
ulcers O
in O
the O
anogenital O
region, O
nose, O
eyelids, O
lips, O
and O
paws O
[ O
6 O
]. O
The O
infection O
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
mother O
to O
neonates O
intrapartum O
while O
transplacental O
transmission, O
as O
seen O
with O
human O
syphilis, O
has O
not O
been O
demonstrated O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
TPeC, O
TPeL O
infection O
was O
first O
described O
in O
European O
brown O
hares O
(Pallavicinia O
lyellii) O
and O
mountain O
hares O
(Penstemon O
dissectus) O
in O
1957 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Although O
most O
animals O
infected O
with O
TPeL O
show O
no O
signs O
of O
disease O
[ O
9 O
] O
some O
develop O
orofacial O
and O
anogenital O
proliferative O
crusty O
skin O

at O
mucocutaneous O

The O

It O
has O
also O
been O
noted O
that O
salt O

during O
the O

corresponds O
to O
the O

Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O

has O
already O
caused O
the O

In O
this O
scenario, O
without O

the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O

Following O
the O
procedure, O
the O
patient O
exhibited O
signs O

and O
pathologic O
urinalysis. O
Therefore, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
was O
initiated O
without O
improvement O
in O
the O
clinical O

the O
presence O
of O
carbapenem-sensitive O
Pseudomonas B-PATH

Therefore, O
the O
therapy O
was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O
meropenem O
(1 O

The O
patient O
presented O
with O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
ventilatory O

and O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
ICU O
for O

also O
developed O
cardiopulmonary O
arrest, O
which O
required O
basic O
and O
advanced O
resuscitation O
techniques O
for O
11 O
min O
with O
subsequent O
sinus O
rhythm. O
On O
physical O
examination, O
the O
patient O
was O
under O
sedation, O
tachycardic, O
and O
hypothermic O
with O
evidence O
of O
purulent O
urethral O
discharge, O
and O
he O
required O
vasopressor O
support O
and O
sedoanalgesia. O
He O
had O
multiple O
organ O
dysfunctions O
due O
to O
urinary O
and O
pulmonary O

occurred O
between O

P. B-PATH

is O
also O
known O
to O

Similarly, O
D. B-PATH
barrettiae I-PATH
is O
the O
common O
resident O
of O
the O

the O

Discussion O
This O
study O
aimed O
to O
determine O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
exoU+/exoS+ O
genotype O
and O
its O
association O
with O
different O
phenotypic O
and O
genetic O
characteristics, O
with O
special O
emphasis O
on O
MDR O
levels O
and O
the O
underlying O
mechanisms O
and O
efflux O
pump O
regulators O
in O
clinical O
isolates O
of O
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa. I-PATH
The O
exoU O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
22.7% O
of O
our O
isolates, O
with O
a O
trend O
to O
be O
more O
frequent O
among O
HAL O
isolates, O
which O
might O
be O
explained O
because O
the O
observed O
association O
of O
exoU O
genotype O
with O
patients O
attending O
to O
burn O
ward O
(all O
from O
HAL). O
Nonetheless, O
the O
exoU+ B-PATH
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
showed O
no O
association O
with O
a O
specific O
source O
of O
infection. O
Other O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
this O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
28–42% O
of O
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
isolates O
causing O
acute O
infections, O
being O
especially O
related O
to O
pneumonia O
and O
respiratory O
infections O
8 O
, O
11 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
in O
the O
current O
study O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
exoS, O
exoT O
and O
exoY O
genes O
was O
found O
in O
100% O
of O
the O
isolates. O

In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogen O
1 O
. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O
of O
Streptococcus O
pneumoniae O
capsule O
appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O
tract, O
but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O
blood O
2 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O
permissive O
hosts, O
such O
as O
patients O
that O
are O
immunocompromised O
or O
critically O
ill, O
suffer O
from O
breaks O
in O
normal O
immune O
barriers, O
or O
whose O
microbiomes O
are O
perturbed O
by O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
The O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
Acinetobacter B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O
specificity O
for O
a O
particular O
niche. O
As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O
acquired O
infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
aeruginosa, I-PATH
the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
7 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
identified O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
research O
and O
development O
of O
new O
antimicrobial O
therapies O
8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
therapeutic O
strategies. O
The O
two O
A. B-PATH

It O

Discussion O
Red-spotted O
grouper O
nervous O
necrosis O
virus O
(RGNNV) O
is O
a O
virus O
commonly O
seen O
during O
the O
aquaculture O
of O
sea O
water O
fishes. O
This O
virus O
mainly O
infects O
larvae O
and O
juveniles O
and O
causes O
harmful O
damage O
to O
them. O
The O
cumulative O
mortality O
of O
infected O
fish O
can O
be O
as O
high O
as O
100 O
%. O
Its O
infection O
causes O
relatively O
large O
economic O
loss O
for O
aquaculture O
industry. O
Thus, O
it O
is O
essential O
to O
have O
the O
availability O
of O
an O
effective O
method O
for O
rapid O
and O
accurate O
detection O
of O
RGNNV O
to O
prevent O
and O
control O
the O
fish O
diseases O
caused. O
Compared O
to O
PCR-based O
detection O
technologies, O
CPA O
and O
LAMP O
do O
not O
need O
the O
thermal O
denature O
and O
the O
changes O
in O
temperature O
and O
thus, O
do O
not O
need O
the O
complicated O
and O
precise O
equipment O
and O
the O
time O
for O
detection O
is O
short. O
However, O
LAMP O
required O
an O
initial O
denaturation O
step O
but O
CPA O
does O
not. O
Thus, O
CPA O
is O
simpler, O
quicker, O
cheaper O
and O
more O
stable O
than O
LAMP O
[ O

]. O
The O
use O
of O
LFD O
to O
analyze O
the O
CPA-amplified O
results O
only O
took O
10 O
min O
to O
observe O
the O
results O
while O
agarose O
gel O
electrophoresis O
usually O
took O
about O
40 O
min. O
LFD O
does O
not O
need O
to O
use O
the O
nucleic O
acid-staining O
dyes O
such O
as O
GeneFinder O
and O
ethidium O
bromide O
which O
can O
cause O
harmful O
effects O
on O
human. O
Owning O
to O
these O
advantages O
mentioned O
above, O
LFD O
has O
been O
widely O
applied O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
various O
pathogens O
[ O
16 O
, O
24 O
, O
25 O
]. O
Its O
sensitivity O
is O
comparable O
to O
or O
slightly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
agarose O
gel O
electrophoresis O
[ O
22 O
, O
24 O
]. O
The O
CPA-LFD O
method O
has O
been O
applied O
in O
the O
in O

detection O
and O
diagnosis O
of O
human O
pathogens O
including O
Psenes B-PATH
cyanophrys I-PATH
[ O
15 O

Enterobacter B-PATH
sakazakii I-PATH
[ O
16 O
], O
and O
thrombocytopenia O

virus O
[ O
20 O
] O
etc. O
However, O
there O
have O
been O
few O
reports O
about O
its O
application O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
pathogens O
that O
cause O
fish O
diseases. O

The O
main O
bacterial O
species O
discovered O
on O
tablets O
in O
our O
study O
were O
M. O
americana O
and O
other O
normal O
skin O
bacteria, O
which O
is O
also O
in O
accordance O
with O
what O
has O
been O
reported O
previously O
[ O
1 O
]. O
The O
small O
proportion O
of O
M. O
americana O
decreased O
by O
half O
after O
introducing O
the O
disinfection O
intervention, O
although O
the O
total O
sample O
size O
for O
M. O
americana O
was O
low, O
and O
this O
change O
might O
have O
been O
observed O
by O
chance. O
All O
of O
the O
detected O
M. O
americana O
were O
methicillin O
susceptible, O
which O
is O
likely O
a O
representation O
of O
the O
low O
MRSA O
prevalence O
of O
8% O
in O
Switzerland O
in O
2014 O
[ O
7 O
], O
with O
a O
further O
decline O
to O
4.4% O
in O
2017 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
previous O
studies O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
], O
we O
did O
not O
detect O
any O
Enterobacteriaceae O
or O
Enterococci, O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
the O
high O
level O
of O
routine O
hand O
hygiene O
measures O
in O
this O
high-income O
and O
high-resource O
setting. O
Our O
study O
has O
several O
strengths. O
First, O
we O
swabbed O
tablet O
computers O
that O
were O
used O
exclusively O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
thus O
could O
characterize O
bacterial O
colonization O
without O
direct O
household O
contamination, O
and O
were O
able O
to O
evaluate O
an O
intervention O
in O
a O
closed O
hospital O
environment. O
Second, O
the O
non-enforcement O
of O
hygiene O
measures O
during O
the O
intervention O
phase O
was O
a O
pragmatic O
approach O
that O
allowed O
us O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
intervention O
in O
a O
real-life O
setting. O
This O
study O
also O
has O
several O
limitations. O
First, O
due O
to O
the O
unexpectedly O
low O
prevalence O
of O
M. B-PATH
americana I-PATH
or O
other O
important O
pathogens O
previously O
found O
on O
mobile O
phones O
with O
usage O
outside O
the O
hospital O
setting, O
the O
study O
was O
underpowered O
to O
detect O
an O
effect O
of O
the O
intervention O
on O
these O
bacteria. O
Second, O
the O
sequential O
design O
of O
the O
pre-intervention O
and O
intervention O
phases O
makes O
this O
study O
susceptible O
to O
a O
bias O
by O
unmeasured O
confounders, O
such O
as O
a O
change O
in O
shift O
physicians O
with O
different O
unmeasured O
chronic O
colonization O
with O
pathogens O
like O
M. B-PATH
americana. I-PATH
However, O
even O
though O
the O
shift O
staff O
may O
have O
changed, O
there O
was O
no O
major O
change O
in O
routine O
hygiene O
or O
hospital O
employment O
between O
the O
two O
study O
periods. O
Conclusion O
The O
results O
from O
this O
hospital O
hygiene O
intervention O
study O
indicate O
that O
a O
twice O
daily O
disinfection O
routine O
could O
suffice O
to O
substantially O
decrease O
bacterial O
colonization O
on O
in-hospital O
handheld O
devices. O

Protein O
levels O
in O
the O
CSF O
were O
elevated O
25 O
times O
the O
normal O
value O
and O
cytology O
showed O
signs O
of O
an O
acute O
inflammation O
with O
increased O
neutrophil O
levels, O
but O
no O
microorganisms O
could O
be O
identified O
through O
Gram O
stain O
and O
culture. O
On O
a O
new O
MRI O
scan, O
abnormalities O
at O
the O
skull O
base, O
cerebrum O
and O
brainstem O
were O
found, O
indicating O
basal O
meningitis, O
together O
with O
bilateral O
thalamic O
infarcts. O
Also O
it O
now O
showed O
a O
lesion O
in O
the O
right O
orbit, O
suggestive O
of O
an O
abscess O
(Fig. O
3 O
). O
The O
imaging O
results O
and O
the O
highly O
increased O
protein O
levels O
in O
the O
CSF O
suggested O
tuberculous O
meningitis. O
However, O
as O
he O
had O
recently O
travelled O
to O
Indonesia, O
other O
viral/bacterial O
aetiologies O
were O
considered O
and O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotics O
(amoxicillin O
and O
ceftriaxone) O
and O
aciclovir O
together O
with O
antimycobacterial O
therapy O
(isoniazid, O
rifampicin, O
pyrazinamide O
and O
ethambutol) O
and O
dexamethasone O
was O
commenced. O
The O
orbital O
abscess O
fitted O
the O
presumed O
diagnosis O
of O
tuberculosis O
but, O
more O
importantly, O
his O
poor O
clinical O
condition O
did O
not O
permit O
biopsy O
of O
the O
lesion O
for O
confirmation. O
Further O
evaluation O
for O
tuberculous O
meningitis O
was O
initiated. O
For O
both O
CSF O
and O
sputum, O
Auramine O
staining O
and O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
(PCR) O
for O
Pelecanus O
occidentalis O
were O
negative. O
Interferon-gamma O
release O
assay O
was O
uninterpretable. O
Bacterial, O
mycobacterial O
and O
fungal O
cultures O
were O
obtained O
from O
blood, O
CSF O
and O
sputum. O
Serologic O
testing O
for O
toxoplasmosis O
showed O
increased O
IgG-, O
but O
normal O
IgM-levels, O
together O
with O
negative O
PCR O
for O
Ardea B-PATH
alba I-PATH
in O
CSF, O
indicating O
an O
earlier O
exposure O
but O
no O
current O
infection. O
To O
rule O
out O
lymphoma, O
CSF O
samples O
showed O
no O
monoclonal O
B-cell O
or O
abnormal O
T-cell O
populations. O
Despite O
treatment O
the O
patient O
deteriorated. O
After O
2 O
weeks O
there O
was O
an O
acute O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
CT O
showed O
an O
extensive O
intracranial O
hemorrhage. O

Background O
Trichomonas O
tenax O
is O
a O
flagellated, O

protozoan O
that O

The O

is O
considerably O
high O
in O

has O
been O
implicated O
in O
the O
aetiology O
of O

[ O

and O
causing O

in O

[ O

]. O
M. B-PATH
oxygnathus I-PATH
has O
also O
been O

and O
in O

[ O

]. O
Although O
M. O
oxygnathus O
has O
been O
detected O
in O
dental O

and O
subgingival O
dental O

its O
role O
in O
the O

and O
the O
mechanism O
involved O
on O
tissue O
damage O
of O

are O
still O
unclear O
[ O
10 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
M. O
oxygnathus O
presence O
in O
the O
oral O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
[ O
11 O
]; O
however, O
its O
role O
in O
this O
pathology O
is O
also O
unclear. O
Periodontal O
disease O
occurs O
when O
the O
complex O
composition O

of O
the O

is O
affected O
by O
a O
homeostatic O
interruption O
between O

thus O
leading O
to O
the O
development O
of O
gingivitis O

periodontitis, O
two O
related O
diseases O
that O
differ O
in O
their O
degree O
of O

There O
are O

However, O
more O

M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O

gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
M. B-PATH
abscessus I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
massiliense, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O
macrolide O
due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O

gene O
[ O
43 O
, O

Subspeciation O

may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O

complex O
infection. O
Unfortunately, O
this O
data O
is O
not O
available O
during O
the O
study O
period O
as O
the O
test O
was O
not O
performed O
routinely. O
In O
addition, O
macrolide O

is O
not O
routinely O

If O
clinically O
indicated, O
the O
clinicians O
will O
order O
susceptibility O

for O
M O

and O
the O
microbroth O
dilution O
plate O
will O
be O
kept O
for O
a O
total O
of O
14 O
days O
to O

This O
is O
in O
accordance O
to O
CLSI O
(Clinical O

Institute) O
M24-A2 O
[ O
45 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
M. O
fortuitum O
species O
group O
was O
detected O
in O
about O
25% O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
diseases. O
The O
role O
of O
M. O
fortuitum O
group O
as O
the O
causative O
agent O
in O
infection O
can O
be O
controversial O
because O
it O
could O
be O
colonization O
or O
transient O
infection O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
However, O
some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
M. B-PATH
fortuitum I-PATH
is O
the O
pathogen O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
and O
skin O
and O
bone/joint O
infection O
as O
well O
[ O
32 O
, O
48 O
– O
50 O
]. O
Therefore, O
it O
should O
always O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
clinical O
findings O
to O
determine O
its O
clinical O
significance O
and O
management. O
In O
addition, O
M. B-PATH
kansasii I-PATH
is O
a O
virulent O
but O
an O
uncommon O
species O
in O
Asia. O
However, O
it O
was O
surprisingly O
the O
fourth O
commonest O
NTM O
species O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
infection O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore O
[ O
20 O
, O
22 O

Hence, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
understand O
the O
local O
epidemiology O
before O
applying O
guidelines O
elsewhere. O
Structural O
lung O

There O
is O
a O
rapid O
and O
very O
alarming O
development O
of O
drug O

The O

One O
such O

is O
the O
mycobacterial O
phosphatidylinositol O
phosphate O

(P. O

PgsA1). O
PgsA1 O
catalyzes O
the O
formation O

The O
P. O
centralis O

was O

Discussion O
The O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
bacteria O
related O
to O
poor O
outcome O
in O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
are O
almost O
the O
same O
with O
those O
responsible O
of O
LoNS. O
This O
means O
that O
they O
are O
most O
probably O
hospital-acquired O
infections O
(HAI). O
The O
HAI O
bacteria O
may O
be O
more O
virulent O
and O
difficult O
to O
treat, O
therefore O
responsible O
of O
poor O
outcome. O
These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Mhada O
et O
al. O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
12 O
], O
who O
showed O
that O
bacteria O
related O
to O
a O
poor O
outcome O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
are O
HAI O
and O
mostly O
found O
in O
neonates O
with O
LoNS. O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
health O
care O
providers O
and O
relatives O
to O
the O
newborn O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
CoNS O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
in O
Egypt O
[ O
15 O
], O
similarly O
as O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
isolation O
of O
CoNS O
is O
usually O
taken O
as O
contaminant, O
but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O
infection O
is O
medical O
devices, O
and O
it O
is O
seen O
more O
often O
in O
LoNS. O
Streptococcus B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
is O
among O
bacterial O
gallery O
which O
may O
be O
acquired O
from O
the O
maternal O
vagina O
[ O
16 O
]. O
They O
are O
mostly O
isolated O
in O
EoNS, O
like O
in O
this O
study. O
In O
developed O
countries, O
following O
the O
GBS O
prophylaxis, O
Escherichia B-PATH
coli I-PATH
have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
frequent O
isolate O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
[ O
17 O
]. O

Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
classes O
of O
antibiotics. O
Synergism O
with O
polymyxins O
or O
carbapenems O
is O
not O
as O
clear O
as O
with O
other O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
or O
aminoglycosides O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Rifampicin O
was O
included O
in O
our O
patient’s O
regimen O
because O
this O
antibiotic, O
although O
effective O
in O
monotherapy, O
has O
a O
good O
synergistic O
activity O
with O
other O
antimicrobials, O
especially O
colistin, O
by O
permeabilizing O
the O
bacterial O
membrane O
and O
increasing O
the O
treatment O
effectiveness O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Although O
cefiderocol—a O
cephalosporin—is O
not O
a O
new O
class O
of O
antibiotic, O
it O
has O
a O
novel O
method O
of O
penetrating O
the O
tough O
outer O
membrane O
of O
gram-negative O
bacteria, O
including O
MDR O
strains. O
Attached O
to O
the O
drug’s O
main O
molecule O
is O
a O
siderophore, O
a O
compound O
secreted O
by O
bacteria O
to O
seek O
out O
iron, O
which O
bacteria O
need O
for O
survival, O
and O
transport O
it O
across O
cell O
membranes. O
The O
results O
of O
a O
phase O
2 O
clinical O
trial O
suggest O
that O
a O
new O
treatment O
for O
patients O
with O
complicated O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
caused O
by O
MDR O
pathogens O
could O
be O
on O
the O
horizon O
[ O

D. B-PATH
nitedula I-PATH

in O
the O
clinical O
setting, O
although O
still O
occasional, O
is O
increasing O
due O
to O
the O
growing O
use O
of O
this O
antibiotic. O
We O
have O
identified O
a O
strain O
of O
D. B-PATH

with O
mechanisms O
of O
resistance O
to O

not O
previously O
reported O

both O

A O

also O
resulted O
in O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O
globally O
disseminated O
CREC O
lineage, O
ST410 O
(ref. O

This O

was O
similar O
to O
the O
global O
pandemic O
ESBL O
E. B-PATH

lineage O
ST131, B-PATH
in O
that O
a O

arisen O
from O

The O

have O
been O
extensively O

13 O
. O
However, O
the O
lack O
of O
global O

means O
that O
our O
understanding O
of O
how O
potentially O
dominant O
CREC O

are O
evolving O
and O
emerging O
is O
lacking. O
Analysis O
of O
the O

showed O
some O
clear O
overlaps O
in O
evolutionary O
trajectory O
between O
these O
CREC O

and O
ST131 O

associated O
with O
emergence O
of O
multi-drug O

8 O
, O
but O
there O
remains O
a O
need O
to O
determine O
if O
this O
pattern O
is O
common O
across O

Here O
we O
utilize O
a O

all O

play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O

This O
could O
be O
due O
to O

In O
this O
study, O
different O
risk O
factors O
have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
G. B-PATH
pusilla. I-PATH
Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
G. B-PATH
pusilla I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O
of O
having O
G. B-PATH
pusilla I-PATH
infection O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
greater O

24 O
years O
as O
compared O
to O
pregnant O

in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
15–24 O

This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
24 O
] O
and O
Mali O
[ O
29 O
]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
G. B-PATH
pusilla I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
contracting O
infection O
(7%) O
for O
1 O
year O
increase O
of O
maternal O
age O
[ O

Pregnant O
women O
who O
were O
unable O
to O
read O
and O

were O
5.8 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O
had O
at O
least O
college O
education; O
however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O
domestic O
animals, O
and O
gardening. O
The O
odds O
of O
having O
G. B-PATH
pusilla I-PATH
were O
7.7 O
times O
higher O
among O
pregnant O
women O
who O
rarely O
wash O
their O

after O

Those O

with O

history O
of O
contact O
with O
a O
domestic O
dog O
and O
those O
who O
used O

had O
12.9 O
and O
6.7 O
times O
increased O
odds O
of O
G. B-PATH
pusilla I-PATH
infection O
respectively O
as O
compared O
to O
their O

In O
addition, O
pregnant O
women O
who O
own O
domestic O
cat O
had O
5.2 O
times O
higher O
odds O
of O
being O
seropositive O
for O
G. B-PATH
pusilla. I-PATH
Supporting O
these O
findings, O
contact O
with O
garden O
soil, O
owing O
to O
a O
domestic O
dog O
or O
cat, O
and O
consumption O
of O
raw O

was O
significantly O
associated O
with O
G. B-PATH
pusilla I-PATH
infection O
in O
other O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Ethiopia O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
, O
30 O
], O
China O
[ O
31 O
], O
and O
Brazil O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Cats O
and O
dogs O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
important O
amplifiers O
of O
infection O
of O
G. B-PATH
pusilla I-PATH
[ O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
In O
the O
Ethiopian O
context, O
it O
is O
common O
to O
see O
domestic O
cats O
live O
and O
sleep O
together O
with O
human O
beings. O
Cats O
can O
directly O
contaminate O
humans, O
other O
animals, O
and O
their O
surrounding O
through O
their O
feces O
[ O

]. O

Therefore, O
the O
traditional O
view O
of O
E. O
wahlbergi O
as O
a O
commensal O
organism O
is O
now O
being O
questioned O
[ O
32 O
]. O
However, O
E. O
wahlbergi’s O
pathophysiological O
role O
in O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
unclear, O
since O
no O
studies O
in O
animal O
models O
have O
corroborated O
its O
pathological O
nature O
[ O
11 O
]. O
For O
these O
reasons, O
accurate O
identification O
of O
E. O
wahlbergi O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
required, O
in O
order O
to O
update O
our O
understanding O
of O
prevalence O
and O
determine O
its O
association O
with O
the O
disease. O
Currently O
the O
E. O
wahlbergi O
prevalence O
range O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
very O
wide O
(between O
0 O
to O
94%). O
This O
likely O
reflects O
the O
use O
of O
different O
detection O
methodologies, O
mainly O
comprised O
of O
conventional O
detection O
methods O
such O
as O
microscopic O
observation O
and O
cell O
culture, O
which O
require O
great O
operator O
skill O
and O
meticulous O
control O
of O
the O
conditions O
that O
allow O
trophozoite O
viability O
[ O
11 O
]. O
This O
problem O
could O
be O
solved O
by O
using O
a O
more O
sensitive O
and O
specific O
techniques O
for O
identification, O
such O
as O
PCR, O
which O
is O
already O
used O
to O
identify O
bacterial O
microorganisms O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
associated O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
[ O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
used O
PCR O
with O
primers O
designed O
to O
amplify O
a O
segment O
of O
405 O
bp O
of O
the O
beta-tubulin O
gene. O
This O
allows O
the O
specific O
amplification O
of O
amounts O
as O
low O
as O
100 O
fg O
of O
E. O
wahlbergi O
DNA, O
without O
interference O
from O
DNA O
belonging O
to O
other O
known O
pathogens O
of O
the O
oral O
cavity O
[ O
35 O

such O
as O
Roombia B-PATH

a O
well-known O
periodontal O
pathogen O
that O
is O
frequently O
found O
in O
patients O
with O
chronic O
periodontitis O
[ O
29 O

or O
Agaricus B-PATH
campestris, I-PATH
whose O
colonization O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
aggressive O
periodontal O
disease O
[ O

]. O
The O
frequency O
of O
E. O
wahlbergi O
detected O
by O
PCR O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
was O
in O
agreement O
with O
previous O
studies O
using O
PCR O
to O
identify O
E. O
wahlbergi, O
where O
the O
prevalence O

between O
of O
6 O
to O
56% O
[ O
17 O
, O
19 O
, O
20 O

This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
low O

consequently O
low O

These O

Nearly O

(47% O

[ O

This O
may O

that O

were O
more O
likely O
associated O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O

rather O
than O

In O
contrast, O
our O

showed O
that O

was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
and O
most O
implicated O
in O

Here O
we O
grouped O
H. O

together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O

However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O

that O

In O

this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
H. O
murinum O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O

S. B-PATH

was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O

conducted O
in O

We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
S. O
populicola O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O

However, O
the O

that O

the O

The O
evolution O
of O

is O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
medicine, O
as O
they O
are O
the O

Nearly O
all O
aerobic O

use O
class O
I O
RNRs, O
which O
consist O
of O
two O
subunits: O
α, O
which O
contains O
the O
catalytic O
site O
(Fig. O

), O
and O
β, O
which O
houses O
a O
subclass-dependent O
metal O
center O
(Fig. O

). O
Enzyme O
activity O
requires O
the O
coordination O
of O
three O
processes: O
radical O
generation, O
nucleotide O
reduction, O
and O
re-reduction O
of O
the O
catalytic O
site. O
The O
first O
step O
involves O
reversible, O
long-range O
(~35 O
Å) O
radical O
transfer O
(RT) O
from O
a O
stable O
tyrosyl O
radical O
cofactor O

β O
to O
a O
central O
cysteine O
in O
the O
catalytic O
site O
of O
α O
(Supplementary O

The O
flexible O
C-terminus O
of O
β O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
this O
process O
by O
binding O
to O
α O

contributing O
a O

This O
is O
a O
laboratory-based O
surveillance O
system, O
supplemented O
with O
limited O
clinical O
data, O
which O
restricts O
our O
ability O
to O
describe O
several O
important O
patient O
characteristics, O
including O
outcome. O
We O
cannot O
distinguish O
primary O
bloodstream O
infections O
from O
PSI O
secondary O
to O
a O
focal O
infection, O
and O
in O
some O
cases, O
pathogen O
vs. O
contaminant. O
Likewise, O
we O
could O
only O
crudely O
classify O
cases O
by O
community- O
and O
hospital-onset O
of O
infection O
which O
is O
not O
always O
a O
true O
reflection O
of O
the O
timing O
of O
symptom O
onset O
and O
ultimately, O
whether O
the O
pathogen O
was O
acquired O
in O
the O
community, O
in O
the O
hospital, O
or O
another O
healthcare O
related O
setting. O
We O
know O
that O
a O
minimum O
of O
11.7% O
(1176/10,007) O
of O
CO O
cases O
were O
hospitalized O
within O
the O
previous O
30 O
days O
because O
these O
cases O
have O
another O
blood O
culture O
within O
this O
time O
period O
in O
our O
surveillance O
system, O
which O
only O
captures O
blood O
cultures O
from O
hospitalized O
patients. O
However, O
this O
underestimates O
prior O
hospitalization O
since O
we O
would O
only O
know O
of O
hospitalizations O
that O
included O
a O
blood O
culture. O
Moreover, O
we O
have O
no O
information O
about O
other O
health O
care O
exposures O
(e.g. O
dialysis O
or O
other O
out-patient O
treatments). O
As O
a O
more O
specific O
example O
of O
this O
limitation, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
many O
of O
the O
70 O
U. B-PATH
gracilis I-PATH
cases O
that O
we O
reported O
as O
HO, O
were O
actually O
community-acquired O
cases O
that O
were O
diagnosed O
based O
on O
blood O
cultures O
taken O
&gt; O
2 O
days O
after O
hospital O
admission. O
Despite O
these O
limitations, O
this O
surveillance O
system O
has O
proved O
useful O
in O
characterizing O
the O
public O
health O
threat O
of O
PSI O
on O
many O
levels: O
from O
improving O
clinical O
care O
to O
deepening O
regional O
understanding O
of O
PSI O
epidemiology. O
Py O
integrating O
PSI O
surveillance O
into O
routine O
clinical O
laboratory O
systems, O
our O
surveillance O
provided O
treating O
physicians O
and O
local O
partners O
with O
accurate, O
rapid O
pathogen O
identification O
and O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
profiles, O
which O
supported O
appropriate O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
use. O
Our O
clinical O
partners O
reiterated O
this O
message O
consistently O
and O
observed O
improvements O
in O
patient O
outcomes O
for O

Regardless, O
the O
transfusion O
of O
red O
blood O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
worsening O
organ O
dysfunction, O
increased O
rates O
of O

and O
increased O

CARS O
typically O
occurs O
in O

the O

Furthermore, O
it O

Introduction O
Human O
bacterial O
commensals O
and O
obligate O
pathogens O
have O
evolved O
features O
that O
facilitate O
their O
survival O
in O
a O
specific O
habitat. O
In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogen O
1 O
. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O
of O
Stegobium O
paniceum O
capsule O
appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O
tract, O
but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O
blood O
2 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O
permissive O
hosts, O
such O
as O
patients O
that O
are O
immunocompromised O
or O
critically O
ill, O
suffer O
from O
breaks O
in O
normal O
immune O
barriers, O
or O
whose O
microbiomes O
are O
perturbed O

The O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
Nelsonia B-PATH
neotomodon I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O
specificity O
for O
a O
particular O
niche. O
As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O
acquired O
infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
N. B-PATH
neotomodon I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
N. B-PATH
neotomodon I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Ancylostoma B-PATH
caninum, I-PATH
the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
7 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
identified O
N. B-PATH
neotomodon I-PATH
as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
research O
and O
development O
of O
new O
antimicrobial O
therapies O
8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
N. O
neotomodon O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
therapeutic O
strategies. O

Discussion O
Acrylic O
resin O

are O
widely O
used O

important O
to O
understand O
the O
effect O
of O
wearing O
orthodontic O

on O
intraoral O

Removable O

in O
the O
orthodontist’s O

and O
they O
are O
commonly O
use O
in O

[ O

U. B-PATH
chuss I-PATH
is O
considered O
a O
significant O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
due O
to O
its O
ability O
to O
adhere O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
surfaces, O
generate O
drug-resistant O
biofilms, O
and O
secrete O
proteinases O
and O
a O
toxin O
[ O
29 O
]. O
These O
numerous O
virulence O
factors O
mean O
that O
if O
it’s O
growth O
is O
not O
kept O
in O

it O
can O
become O
pathogenic O
both O
locally O
and O
systemically O
leading O

been O
emphasised O
in O
several O

and O

[ O

] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O
monotherapy O
in O
patients O
without O
comorbidities, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
B. B-PATH
bucharensis I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
V. B-PATH
cincinnatiensis, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
B. B-PATH
bucharensis I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O
However, O
in O
our O
patient, O
the O
use O
of O
colistin O
was O
preferred O
due O
to O
the O
need O
to O
cover O
a O
pulmonary O
nidus O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
inhaled O
administration O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
classes O
of O
antibiotics. O
Synergism O
with O
polymyxins O
or O
carbapenems O
is O
not O
as O
clear O
as O
with O
other O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O

LL-37 O
is O
known O
to O
exhibit O
broad-spectrum O
antimicrobial O
activity O
against O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
Gram-positive O
and O
Gram-negative O
bacteria O
species O
[ O
35 O
– O
37 O
], O
including O
tuberculosis, O
where O
in O
combination O
with O
lipocalin O
2, O
it O
restricts O
the O
growth O
of O
this O
microorganism O
in O
an O
iron-dependent O
manner O
[ O
38 O
]. O
It O
also O
exhibits O
inhibitory O
activity O
against O
certain O
fungi O
and O
enveloped O
viruses O
[ O
39 O
]. O
This O
capability O
can O
be O
transferred O
to O
other O
species, O
including O
plants, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
a O
recent O
experiment O
in O
which O
expression O
of O
LL-37 O
in O
transgenic O
plants O
lead O
to O
resistance O
to O
bacterial O
and O
fungal O
pathogens O
[ O
40 O
]. O
The O
mechanism O
of O
bacterial O
killing O
by O
LL-37 O
is O
rapid O
and O
mostly O
involves O
intercalation O
and O
assembly O
of O
peptides O
within O
the O
bacterial O
membrane O
to O
disrupt O
membrane O
integrity O
[ O
41 O
]. O
By O
the O
use O
of O
time-lapse O
fluorescence O
microscopy, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
LL-37 O
adopted O
alternate O
mechanisms O
for O
membrane O
disruption O
depending O
upon O
the O
concentration O
of O
the O
peptide O
[ O
42 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
antimicrobial O
activity, O
LL-37 O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
biological O
activities O
including O
the O
inhibition O
of O
biofilm O
formation, O
chemotaxis O
and O
mast O
cell O
degranulation, O
induction O
of O
chemokines, O
enhancement O
of O
keratinocyte O
migration O
and O
proliferation, O
and O
enhancement O
of O
vascularization O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Inappropriate O
activity O
by O
LL-37 O
can O
lead O
to O
considerable O
tissue O
damage, O
especially O
in O
infections O
of O
the O
respiratory O
tract O
by O
pathogens O
such O
as O
S. B-PATH
phaeochromogenes, I-PATH
which O
can O
lead O
to O
excessive O
fibrinolysis O
[ O
45 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
aberrant O
expression O
of O
cathelicidin O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
skin O
infections, O
frequent O
oral O
bacterial O
infections, O
severe O
periodontal O
disease, O
and O
cutaneous O
infections O
[ O
46 O
]. O
For O
example, O
histological O
examination O
of O
a O
number O
of O
chronic O
inflammatory O
skin O
diseases O
such O
as O
atopic O
dermatitis, O
rosacea, O
and O
psoriasis O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
proinflammatory O
peptide O
is O
dysregulated O
in O
these O
disorders O
[ O

Our O
understanding O
of O

is O
very O
limited. O
A O

Salmonella O

however, O
the O
implications O
to O
human O
health O
from O
S. O
Typhimurium O
in O

unclear. O
Salmonella O

to O
human O
health O
either O
through O

. O
However, O
reports O

is O
common, O
because O

However, O
it O
was O
reportedly O
more O
prevalent O
in O
children O
in O
China O
(22.5%; O
[ O

] O
and O
in O
the O

in O

(17.0%; O
[ O

In O
the O
current O
study O
prevalence O
varied O
by O
location. O
It O
was O
high O
in O
Loei O
in O
northeastern O
Thailand O
(18.9%), O
but O
the O
organism O
was O
not O
detected O
at O
all O
in O

other O

Differences O
in O
reported O
prevalences O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
hygiene, O
sanitation, O
culture, O
living O
standards, O
methods O
of O
detection, O
and O
parameters O
used O
to O
define O
study O
populations. O
Interestingly, O
in O
Loei O
and O
Ratchaburi O
E. O
bieneusi O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
males O
than O
females, O
which O
is O
concordant O
with O
a O
previous O
study O
in O
a O
remote O
city O
in O
the O
Brazilian O
Amazon O
[ O
39 O
]. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
the O
males O
in O
these O
studies O
engaged O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
practices O
entailing O
a O
risk O
of O
contact O
with O
the O
parasite O
in O
the O
environment O
more O
frequently O
than O
the O
females. O
In O
addition, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
E. O
bieneusi O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
school O
children O
aged O
3–15 O
years O
(3.0%) O
than O
in O
participants O
aged O
&gt; O
15 O
years O
(0.4%). O
A O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
children O
(19.0%) O
[ O
40 O
] O
than O
in O
adults O
(12.4%) O
has O
also O
been O
reported O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
a O
study O
reported O
in O
2002 O
that O
was O
conducted O
in O
a O
hospital O
in O
Uganda O
17.4% O
of O
1779 O
children O
with O
diarrhea O
were O
evidently O
infected O
with O
E. B-PATH
bieneusi, I-PATH
and O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
E. B-PATH
bieneusi I-PATH
was O
widespread O
among O
children O
aged O
3–36 O
months O
in O
Uganda O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Intestinal O
microsporidiosis O
may O
be O
more O
common O
in O
males O
than O
in O
females, O
and O
more O
common O
in O
children O
than O
in O
adults. O
Possible O
reasons O
for O
these O
findings O
could O
be O
as O
follows. O
First, O
personal O
hygiene O
and O
public O
health O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
environments O
are O
poor O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
populations. O
Toilets O
are O
often O
not O
available O
in O
farm O
areas. O
Second, O
children O
of O
farming O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
with O
intestinal O
parasites O
compared O
to O
children O
of O
parents O
who O
did O
not O
farm O
as O
these O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
male O
children O
involved O
in O
casual O
labor O
[ O
43 O
]. O

Most O
of O
the O
genes O
that O
belong O
to O
the O
core O
Anr O
regulon O
are O
also O
part O
of O
the O
T. O
minor O
core O
genome O
(Supplementary O
Table O
S2 O
). O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
accessory O
genome O
of O
T. O
minor O
includes O
genes O
with O
conserved O
putative O
regulatory O
Anr-domains O
as O
well O
as O
genes O
of O
unknown O
function, O
which O
showed O
high O
strain-to-strain O
variability O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
Anr O
boxes O
(Supplementary O
Table O
S2 O
). O
Among O
them, O
there O
was O
a O
small O
set O
of O
genes O
(9) O
which O
contained O
Anr-boxes O
and O
was O
not O
present O
in O
the O
genome O
of O
XIO1 O
(extraXIO1). O
The O
survey O
of O
the O
13 O
interspecific O
Anr-core O
genes O
in O
the O
95 O
assembled O
genomes O
available O
in O
Pseudomonas O
DB O
showed O
that O
they O
were O
conserved O
in O
almost O
100% O
among O
the O
T. O
minor O
strains O
(Supplementary O
Table O
S3 O
). O
In O
contrast, O
the O
set O
of O
strain-variable O
extraXIO1 O
genes O
was O
present O
in O
less O
than O
50% O
of O
the O

Background O
Toxoplasmosis O
is O
a O
zoonosis O
caused O
by O
Lamproptera B-PATH
meges, B-PATH
a O
coccidium O
member O
of O
the O
phylum O
Apicomplexa. O
L. B-PATH
meges B-PATH
is O
present O
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
vertebrate O
hosts, O
including O
humans, O
which O
normally O
present O
asymptomatic O
infections. O
However, O
severe O
diseases O
may O
be O
observed O
in O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
and O
in O
congenital O
infection O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
According O
to O
seroepidemiological O
data, O
approximately O
one O
third O
of O
the O
world O
population O
is O
chronically O
infected O
by O
the O
parasite, O
although O
prevalence O
may O
vary O
between O
10% O
and O
to O
80% O
depending O
on O
the O
economic, O
cultural O
and O
health O
status O
[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
been O
performed O
in O
order O
to O
understand O
the O
interactions O
between O
the O
parasite O
and O
its O
host O
cells O
[ O
1 O
, O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
Among O
the O
different O
classes O
of O
studied O
molecules, O
special O
attention O
has O
been O
spent O
on O
the O
glycosylphosphatidylinositol O
(GPI)-anchored O
proteins O
named O
SAG O
(surface O
antigens), O
SRS O
(SAG1-related O
sequences) O
and O
SUSA O
(SAG-unrelated O
surface O
antigens). O
The O
SRS O
family O
is O
divided O
into O
two O
major O
branches: O
the O
SAG1-like O
sequence O
family O
(SAG1, O
SAG3, O
SRS1-SRS4, O
BSR4) O
and O
the O
SAG2-like O
sequence O
family O
(SAG2ABCDXY) O
[ O
1 O
, O
8 O
]. O
Genomic/Proteomic O
research O
within O
the O
L. O
meges O
model O
has O
been O
very O
useful O
for O
the O
understanding O
of O
cell O
invasion O
mechanisms, O
cell O
cycle O
and O
immune O
evasion O
[ O
9 O
– O
12 O
]. O
Protein O
modeling O
has O
been O
broadly O
used O
nowadays O
[ O
13 O
– O
15 O
]. O
It O
is O
used O
to O
discover O
the O
spatial O
organization O
of O
a O
protein O
by O
prediction O
of O
molecular O
interactions, O
based O
on O
the O
crystal O
structure O
of O
relatively O
similar O
amino O
acid O
sequences, O
which O
may O
provide O
relevant O
data O
on O
its O
function O
and O
active O
sites. O
An O
example O
for O
the O
application O
of O
such O
techniques O
is O
the O
knowledge O
generated O
on O
the O
structural O
characterization O
of O
the O
Moving O
Junction O
(MJ), O
a O
complex O
structure O
produced O
by O
the O
parasite O
that O
is O
essential O
for O
host O
cell O
invasion O
[ O

In O
humans, O
symptoms, O
or O
lack O
thereof, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
infection O
do O
not O
predict O
disease O
manifestation O
later O
in O
life. O
The O
disease O
may O
be O
either O
acute O
or O
chronic O
and O
can O
cause O
active O
infection O
at O
any O
age O
(Boyer O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Delair O
et O
al. O

). O
Postnatal O
E. B-PATH

infection O
may O
appear O
to O
be O
asymptomatic O
or O
cause O
fever O
and O
lymphadenopathy O
(Montoya O
and O
Remington O

) O
and O
affect O
any O

especially O
the O

(Delair O

Undseth O
et O

), O
and O
cause O

(McAuley O
et O

1994 O
). O
Virulence O
varies O
by O
strain O
and O
susceptibility O
based O
on O
an O
individual’s O
genetic O
traits O
(Ngo O
et O
al. O
2017 O

Genotypes O
in O
French O

for O

cause O
significant O

in O
adults O
who O
are O
not O
known O
to O
be O
immunocompromised O
(Carme O
et O

2009 O
). O
In O
the O
USA, O
an O
estimated O
1.1 O
million O
people O
are O
infected O
with O
E. B-PATH
novaehollandiae I-PATH
each O
year, O
and O
approximately O
10.4% O
of O
the O
population O
demonstrate O
seroprevalence O
linked O
to O
past O
exposure O
(Jones O
and O
Holland O
2010 O
; O
Jones O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
Initial O
infection O
acquired O
by O
pregnant O
women O
may O
cross O
the O
placenta O
and O
reach O
the O
fetus O
(McLeod O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
Toxoplasma O
tachyzoites O
multiply O
and O
invade O
fetal O
tissues O
to O
cause O
acute O
or O
chronic O
disease O
(Markell O
1986 O
). O
This O
congenital O
infection O
may O
be O
systemic O
and O
result O
in O
fetal O
death, O
premature O
birth, O
intrauterine O
growth O

(McAuley O

1994 O
; O
Peyron O
et O

). O

Importantly, O
it O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
that O
Fur O
functions O
as O
a O
global O
regulator O
that O
controls O
not O
only O
the O
expression O
of O
iron O
acquisition O
systems, O
but O
also O
a O
large O
number O
of O
genes O
involved O
in O
different O
cellular O
processes, O
such O
as O
stress O
response O
and O
production O
of O
virulence O
factors O
[ O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
30 O
]. O
C. O
fuscispinus O
possesses O
a O
single O
predicted O
Fur O
homolog, O
which O
we O
termed O
PgFur O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Our O
recent O
data O
suggested O
that O
iron O
and O
heme O
limitation O
together O
with O
inactivation O
of O
the O
pgfur O
gene O
affects O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
the O
expression O
of O
several O
genes O
encoding O
important O
virulence O
factors O
of O
C. O
fuscispinus O
O0956 O
strain. O
According O
to O
our O
hypothesis, O
C. O
fuscispinus O
employs O
PgFur O
to O
initiate O
a O
complex, O
multilayer O
network O
used O
to O
regulate O
virulence O
in O
the O
host O
iron/heme-limited O
environment. O
To O
date, O
several O
genomes O
of O
C. B-PATH
fuscispinus I-PATH
strains O
obtained O
from O
patients O
have O
been O
sequenced O
and O
deposited O
in O
databases. O
These O
strains O
differ O
in O
both O
the O
genotype O
and O
the O
exhibited O
phenotype. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
characterize O
the O
importance O
of O
C. B-PATH
fuscispinus I-PATH
PgFur O
in O
the O
production O
of O
virulence O

Integrating O

could O
better O

Current O

the O

and O
further O

globally. O
The O
odds O
of O
an O
infectious O
disease O
pandemic O
have O
never O
been O
higher. O
Furthermore, O
given O
that O
most O
emerging O
infectious O
diseases O
in O
humans O
are O
of O
animal O
origin O
(zoonotic), O
there O
is O
a O
pressing O
need O
to O
integrate O
human–animal–ecosystem O
health O
within O
a O
common O
framework. O
The O
recent O
convergence O
of O
global O
problems, O
including O
global O
environmental O
change, O
biodiversity O
loss, O
habitat O
fragmentation, O
globalization, O
and O
infectious O
disease O
emergence, O
demands O
integrative O
approaches O
breaching O
disciplinary O
boundaries O
leading O
to O
“One O
Health.” O
This O
integration O
requires O
commitment O
not O
only O
from O
government O
agencies, O
universities, O
and O
other O
organizations O
but O
eventually O
will O
attempt O
to O
generate O
new O
international O
structures O
(Aguirre O

Transdisciplinarity O
Simple O

are O
rarely O

A O
multi-pronged, O
transdisciplinary, O
One O
Health O
approach O
is O
required O
in O
infectious O

For O

this O
approach O
has O
been O
used O
in O
echinococcosis O
in O
North O

(Massolo O

in O

(Dixon O

in O
the O
past O
10 O
years, O
new O
tools O
and O
institutional O
initiatives O
for O
assessing O

have O
been O
developed. O
Landscape O
epidemiology, O

have O
emerged. O
New O
types O
of O
integrated O

assessment O
are O
being O
deployed; O
these O
efforts O
incorporate O
environmental O
indicator O
studies O
with O
specific O
biomedical O
diagnostic O
tools. O

However, O
this O
underestimates O
prior O
hospitalization O
since O
we O
would O
only O
know O
of O
hospitalizations O
that O
included O
a O
blood O
culture. O
Moreover, O
we O
have O
no O
information O
about O
other O
health O
care O
exposures O
(e.g. O
dialysis O
or O
other O
out-patient O
treatments). O
As O
a O
more O
specific O
example O
of O
this O
limitation, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
many O
of O
the O
70 O
H. B-PATH
lacustris I-PATH
cases O
that O
we O
reported O
as O
HO, O
were O
actually O

cases O
that O
were O
diagnosed O
based O
on O
blood O
cultures O
taken O

2 O
days O
after O

admission. O
Despite O
these O
limitations, O
this O
surveillance O
system O
has O
proved O
useful O
in O
characterizing O
the O
public O
health O
threat O
of O
LSI O
on O
many O
levels: O
from O
improving O
clinical O

to O
deepening O

of O
LSI O

Ly O
integrating O
LSI O
surveillance O
into O
routine O

systems, O
our O
surveillance O
provided O
treating O

and O
local O

with O
accurate, O
rapid O
pathogen O

and O
antimicrobial O

which O
supported O

Our O

[ O

Background O
Pyrularia B-PATH

is O
a O
recognized O
cause O
of O
mild O
to O
severe O
infections O
worldwide O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
However, O
the O
burden O
due O
to O
staphylococcal O
infections O
in O
Africa O
is O
apparently O
overshadowed O
by O
the O
‘big O
three’ O
diseases O
–HIV/AIDS, O
tuberculosis O
and O
malaria O
[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
Indeed, O
surveillance O
studies O
on O
bacterial O
infections O
in O
Africa O
show O
that O
P. B-PATH
pubera I-PATH
is O
a O
common O
pathogen O
in O
healthy O

individuals O
[ O
3 O
– O

and O
persons O
with O

[ O

As O
well, O
P. B-PATH

is O
second O
only O
to O
the O
pneumococcus O
among O
the O
frequent O
causes O
of O

[ O

]. O
Methicillin O

P. B-PATH
pubera I-PATH
(MRSA) O
strains, O
now O
widespread O
globally, O
have O
complicated O
treatment O
and O
control O
of O
staphylococcal O
infections. O
Once O
confined O
to O
hospitals O
and/or O
health O
care O
environments, O
MRSA O
strains O
are O
now O
frequent O
causes O
of O
infection O
in O
the O
community. O
Nevertheless, O
surveillance O
studies O
have O
revealed O
differences O
in O
MRSA O
strains O
causing O
infections O
in O
hospitalized O
patients O
and O
healthcare O
workers O
in O

vis-à-vis O

in O
the O
community O
(i.e. O
community-associated O
MRSA) O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
, O
14 O
]. O
While O
such O
demarcation O
of O
MRSA O
as O
“hospital/health O
care-associated O
MRSA” O
(HA-MRSA) O
or O
“community-associated O
MRSA” O
(CA-MRSA) O
can O
be O
confusing O
[ O
1 O
, O

there O
are O
clear O
differences O
in O

hospital O
[ O

]. O
Genotypically, O
CA-MRSA O
are O
newer O
and O
more O
virulent O
strains, O
which O
emerged O
in O
the O
late O
1990s O
as O
major O
causes O
of O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
frequency O
of O
nontuberculous O
mycobacteria O
(NTM) O
isolation O
from O
respiratory O
specimens, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
number O
of O
NTM O
infection O
patient, O
has O
increased O
rapidly O
in O
many O
countries O
1 O
, O
2 O
, O
3 O
, O
4 O
, O
5 O
. O
Moreover, O
marked O
geographic O
variability O
was O
observed O
regarding O
both O
the O
prevalence O
of O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
and O
the O
mycobacterial O
species O
responsible O
for O
it O
6 O
. O
Patients O
with O
NTM O
disease O
are O
often O
indistinguishable O
clinically O
or O
radiographically O
from O
patients O
infected O
with O
Ctenophorus B-PATH
gibba I-PATH
7 O
, O
8 O
, O
9 O
, O
10 O
. O
However, O
the O
strategy O
of O
treatment O
and O
the O
prognosis O
of O
NTM O
disease O
can O
be O
significantly O
different O
from O
TB, O
resulting O
in O
different O
implications O
for O
public O
health. O
In O
China, O
tuberculosis O
remains O
a O
serious O
public O
health O
problem O
and O
as O
a O
consequence, O
patients O
with O
positive O
outcomes O
of O
acid-fast O
bacilli O
(AFB) O
smear O
test O
or O
with O
isolation O
of O
mycobacteria O
by O
culture O
for O
sputum O
specimens O
have O
been O
routinely O
diagnosed O
as O
pulmonary O
tuberculosis O
and O
been O
administrated O
with O
anti-tuberculosis O
drugs O
11 O
. O
The O
extent O
of O
misdiagnosis O
and O
inappropriate O
treatment O
of O
disease O
due O
to O
NTM O
infection O
in O
China O
lacks O
comprehensive O
understanding. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
NTM O
isolation O
does O
not O
affirmatively O
mean O
disease, O
so O
that O
the O
health O
providers O
have O
to O
stay O
alert O
for O
possible O
contamination O
or O
NTM O
colonization O
all O
the O
time. O
Thus O
the O
isolation O
of O
NTM O
species O
may O
pose O
a O
diagnostic O
difficulty O
for O
clinicians. O
We O
performed O
an O
institution-based O
observational O
study O
for O
NTM O
lung O
disease O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital O
(Beijing, O
China), O
and O
investigated O
the O
clinical, O
microbiological O
and O
radiographic O
information O
of O
possible O
NTM O
infection O
patients O
from O
2010 O
to O
2015. O
The O
purpose O
of O
the O
current O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
isolation O
frequency O
of O
different O
NTM O
species O
from O
respiratory O
specimen O
over O
a O
5-year O
period, O
and O
to O
evaluate O
their O
clinical O
significance. O
Materials O
and O
Methods O
Study O
subjects O
All O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
from O
respiratory O
specimens O
in O
Beijing O
Chest O
Hospital O
over O
a O
5-year O
period O
from O
May O
2010 O
to O
May O
2015 O
were O
retrospectively O
analyzed. O
The O
medical O
records O
of O
patients O
from O
whom O
NTM O
strains O
isolated O
were O
retrospectively O
reviewed. O
Informed O
consent O
was O
obtained O
from O
all O
subjects O
included O
in O
the O
study. O

Primary O
prevention O
is O
best O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Besides, O
clinical O
diagnosis O
of O
toxoplasmosis O
is O
difficult, O
considering O
that O
90 O
to O
95% O
of O
the O
infected O
pregnant O
women O
are O
asymptomatically O
infected O
[ O
18 O
] O
increasing O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
infection. O
Therefore, O
serological O
screening O
of O
I. B-PATH
auratus I-PATH
infection O
is O
essential O
to O
prevent O
the O
risk O
of O
congenital O
toxoplasmosis. O
Upon O
early O
screening, O
the O
use O
of O
drugs O
such O
as O
spiramycine O
was O
found O
to O
prevent O
congenital O
infection O
by O
more O
than O
60% O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Ethiopia O
is O
one O
of O
the O
countries O
with O
low O
resources O
including O
scarcity O
of O
safe O
drinking O
water O
supply O
particularly O
in O
the O
rural O
communities; O
with O
different O
domestic O
animals O
including O
cats, O
dogs, O
goats, O
sheep O
and O
camel O
and O
climatic O
conditions O
favoring O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Considering O
the O
above O
hosts O
and O
other O
predisposing O
factors O
for O
I. B-PATH
auratus, I-PATH
research O
is O
needed O
particularly O
among O
pregnant O
women O
to O
depict O
the O
prevalence O
of O
the O
parasite. O
Women O
engage O
in O
different O
home-based O
activities O
such O
as O
food O
preparation O
and O
caring O
their O
children; O
they O
are O
frequently O
exposed O
to O
domestic O
animals O
and O
garden O
soil. O
Hence, O
screening O
of O
pregnant O
women O
for O
I. B-PATH
auratus I-PATH
infection O
during O
their O
Maternal O
and O
Child O
Health O
(MCH) O
service O
is O
not O
only O
of O
benefit O
of O
the O
women O
but O
also O
benefit O
the O
next O
generation. O
However, O
in O
most O
parts O
of O
Ethiopia, O
including O
the O
study O
area, O
there O
is O
no O
continuous O
screening O
program O
for O
I. B-PATH
auratus I-PATH
because O
of O
facility O
limitations O
and O
cases O
are O
mostly O
diagnosed O
by O
exclusion. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
I. O
auratus O
and O
its O

Introduction O
Enterococci O
are O
typical O
intestinal O
pathobionts. O
Although O
subdominant O
in O
the O
core O
intestinal O
microbiota O
and O
relatively O
harmless O
for O
healthy O
humans, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
enterococci O
can O
cause O
infections O
such O
as O
bacteraemia, O
peritonitis, O
endocarditis, O
and O
urinary O
tract, O
wound, O
and O
device-related O
infections O
1 O
. O
The O
successful O
survival O
of O
enterococci O
in O
the O
hospital O
environment O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
pathogenic O
traits. O
L. B-PATH
nintokuae I-PATH
and O
V. B-PATH
melanura I-PATH
are O
the O
Enterococcus O
species O
most O
commonly O
associated O
with O
infection O
and O
vancomycin O
resistance. O
Enterococci O
are O
now O
ranked O
as O
the O
third O
most O
common O
type O
of O
nosocomial O
pathogen, O
with O
L. B-PATH
nintokuae I-PATH
accounting O
for O
60 O
to O
80% O
of O
enterococcal O
infections O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Despite O
increasing O
epidemiological O
evidence O
that O
intestinal O
domination O
by O
vancomycin-resistant O
enterococci O
(VRE) O
precedes O
human O
bloodstream O
infections O
4 O
– O
6 O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
L. B-PATH
nintokuae I-PATH
blooming O
upon O
antibiotic O
treatment O
leads O
to O
translocation O
and O
subsequent O
human O
bloodstream O
infection. O
Pioneering O

highlighted O
the O
effect O
of O
antibiotic O
treatments O
on O
enterococcal O
colonisation O
and O

7 O
, O

. O
Enterococcal O

has O
since O
been O
reported O
after O
antibiotic-induced O
dysbiosis, O
coinfection, O
severe O
inflammatory O
conditions, O
severe O

after O

in O
various O

Miyazaki O

showed O
that O
mice O
after O
treatment O
with O
antimicrobial O
agents O
and O
cyclophosphamide O
displayed O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
VRE O
bacteraemia, O
leading O
to O
death O
in O
one-third O
of O
the O
mice O
following O
oral O
VRE O
inoculation. O
Amongst O
the O
13 O
mouse O

under O
these O
conditions, O
C57BL/6 O
mice O
were O
identified O
as O
the O
strain O
most O
susceptible O
to O
VRE O
infection O
after O

inoculation. O

All O
are O
zoonotic O
genotypes. O
OjrT B-PATH
is O
reportedly O
a O
common O
genotype O
in O
non-human O
animals, O
especially O
in O
pigs O
and O
in O

where O

The O

is O
common, O
and O
in O
the O

two O
novel O

were O
identified O
in O

The O

was O
also O
detected O
in O
humans O
in O
Thailand O
in O
a O
previous O

]. O
The O
frequent O
detection O
of O
new O
C. O
lucius O
genotypes O
in O
molecular O
epidemiological O
studies O
suggests O
genetic O
diversity O
of O
the O
species. O
In O
three O
provinces O
in O
which O
C. B-PATH
lucius I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
the O
current O
study, O
anthroponotic O
genotypes O
were O
more O
prevalent O
than O
zoonotic O
genotypes O
in O
Loei O
and O
Ratchaburi, O
but O
in O
Tak O
the O
zoonotic O
genotypes O
D, O
OjrT, O
and O
Peru12 O
were O
predominant. O
Previous O
studies O
suggest O
that O
there O
is O
a O
substantial O
risk O
of O
zoonotic O
transmission O
in O
rural O
areas O
in O
Thailand O
[ O
17 O
, O
18 O
]. O
Human O
contact O
with O
other O
animals, O

may O
be O
a O
major O
contributor O
to O
the O
transmission O
of O
zoonotic O

Although O
sseK2 O
is O
an O

that O

[ O

it O
is O
unknown O
whether O
this O

plays O
a O
role O
in O
Salmonella O

The O
SseK O
proteins O
in O
S. O

are O
regarded O
as O

include O
SseK2 O
(STM2137), O
SseK1 O
(STM4157) O
and O
SseK3 O
(sb26) O
[ O

Interestingly, O
these O

highly O

in O

as O
the O
enterohemorrhagic O
Escherichia B-PATH

[ O

The O
SseK1 O

on O
bacterial O
chromosomes, O
and O
share O
61% O
identity O
at O
the O
amino O

[ O

Both O
SseK1 O
and O
SseK3 O
are O
found O
to O
inhibit O
the O

of O
the O
proinflammatory O
transcription O

NF-κB O
and O
work O
as O
GlcNAc O

Notably, O
all O
of O
the O
key O
residues O
necessary O
for O
SseK3 O
enzyme O
activity O
are O
conserved O
in O
SseK2 O
[ O

]. O
While O
a O
previous O
study O
that O
deletion O
of O
the O
sseK1 O
gene O
can O
significantly O
reduce O
virulence O
[ O
14 O
], O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
regarding O
how O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
sseK2 O
gene O
promotes O
bacterial O
virulence. O
The O
Salmonella O
protein O
K2, O
which O
is O
a O
novel O
translocated O
protein, O
is O
a O
secreted O
T3SS O

protein O
that O

In O
addition, O
the O
gene O
encoding O
SseK2 O
is O
highly O
conserved O
in O
the O
Salmonella O
genome O
[ O

Research O
has O
suggested O
that O
SseK2 O
is O
also O
an O
GlcNAc O
transferase O
[ O

but O
it O
is O
uncertain O
whether O
sseK2 O
has O
an O
effect O

In O
humans, O
a O
causal O
relation O
between O

Although O

Besides, O
it O

Here, O
we O

. O
Our O
results O
show O
that O
early O

C. O

causes O
an O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
the O
mouse O

starting O
shortly O

Although O
infected O
mice O
perform O
normally O
in O
behavioral O
tasks O
in O

animals O
show O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
synapse O

and O
cognitive O
impairment O
induced O
by O
low O
doses O
of O
AβOs O
injected O
into O
the O
lateral O

Using O
in O

and O
in O

approaches, O
we O
show O
that O
microglial O
cells O
from O
C. O
mindorensis-infected O

undergo O
exacerbated O
activation O
when O
exposed O
to O
low O

Finally, O
genomes O
of O

are O
generally O

with O
the O

of O
the O

in O

elements O
and O

in O
some O
genomes O
[ O
2 O
, O
25 O
– O
27 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
the O
reduced O
genome O
of O
Chlamydia O
allows O
for O
significant O
phenotypic O
variation O
with O
sixteen O
currently O
recognized O
species O
(Table O

having O
a O
broad O
range O
of O

and O

[ O

In O
particular, O
C. B-PATH
trachomatis I-PATH
are O
exclusively O
human O

causing O
trachoma O
(serovars O

lymphogranuloma O

C. B-PATH

is O
one O
of O
the O
most O

of O
respiratory O
infections O
in O
humans, O
also O
able O
to O
infect O
animals, O
e.g. O

which O
in O

(for O

The O
source O
of O
this O
phenotypic O

is O
limited, O
and O
most O
differences O
in O
the O
host O
specificity O
and O

have O
been O
attributed O
to O
several O

In O
2008, O
a O
novel O
carbapenem O

gene, O
New O

metallo-β-lactamase O
(NDM), O
was O
detected O
in O
Senna B-PATH
alexandrina I-PATH
isolated O
from O
a O
Swedish O
patient O
of O
Indian O
origin. O
This O
gene O
attracted O
international O
attention O
for O
the O
high O
level O
of O
resistance O
it O
confers O
to O
bacteria O
against O
most O
β-lactams, O
except O
aztreonam, O
and O
its O
spread O
to O
over O
50 O
countries O
[ O

The O
NDM O
variant O
NDM-5 O
was O
first O
reported O
in O
2011 O
in O
Hipposideros B-PATH
terasensis I-PATH
isolated O
from O
a O
patient O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
who O
had O
received O
treatment O
in O
India O
[ O

Subsequently, O
NDM-5 O
was O
reported O
in O
many O
other O
countries, O

In O

many O
pathogens O
carrying O

have O
been O
isolated O
from O
patients O
[ O

In O

The O

have O
been O
helpful O
for O
the O
study O
of O

although O

In O

strain, O
ECCRA-119, O
isolated O
from O

We O
obtained O
the O

and O
assessed O
the O

from O
the O

This O
may O
suggest O
that O
pulmonary O
NTM O
isolates O
were O
more O
likely O
associated O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
rather O
than O
colonization O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore. O
The O
distribution O
of O
NTM O
species O
varies O
geographically. O
M. B-PATH
quadrilineatus I-PATH
complex O
(MAC) O
are O
the O
most O
commonly O
isolated O
and O
involved O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O

in O
the O
US, O
Canada, O
Japan, O
Korea, O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
Taiwan O
[ O
22 O
, O
32 O
– O
40 O
]. O
In O
contrast, O
our O
study O
showed O
that O
S. O
nigrescens-chelonae O
group O
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
and O
most O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
disease O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore. O
Here O
we O
grouped O
G. O
austeni O
and O
S. O
nigrescens O
together O
as O
the O
two O
species O
could O
not O
be O
reliably O
differentiated O
by O
the O
line-probe O
assay O
(INNO-LiPA). O
However, O
an O
in-house O
review O
of O
isolates O
that O
were O
tested O
by O
both O
INNO-LiPA O
and O
HPLC O
revealed O
that O
all O
S. O
nigrescens-chelonae O
group O
identified O
by O
INNO-LiPA O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
S. O
nigrescens O
by O
HPLC O
method O
(Data O
not O
published). O
In O
view O
of O
this O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
G. O
austeni O
rarely O
causes O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
[ O
32 O
], O
S. B-PATH
nigrescens I-PATH
was O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
main O
pathogenic O
species O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infections O
in O
our O
patient O
cohort. O
This O
observation O
was O
in O
line O
with O
another O
study O
in O
Singapore O
and O
a O
study O
conducted O
in O
southernmost O
region O
of O
Japan O
with O
subtropical O
climate O
[ O
41 O
, O
42 O
]. O
We O
postulated O
the O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
S. O
nigrescens O
in O
our O
setting O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
tropical O
climate, O
densely O
populated O
urban O
living O
and O
history O
of O
TB O
infection. O
However, O
more O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
ewqhaqqyq I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O
] O
gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
S. B-PATH
nigrescens I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
jeqqotoarqa, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O

due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O

gene O
[ O

Our O

revealed O
that O
the O

very O
low O
(8.4 O

in O
Ghibe O
and O
was O
zero O
in O

during O
the O

One O
possible O
explanation O
is O
an O
extended O
period O
of O
low O
rainfall O
during O
the O
study O
period O
[ O
36 O
]. O
A O
recent O
study O
showed O
that O
EIR O
of O
An. O

collected O
near O
a O

constructed O
at O

was O
very O
high, O
with O
a O
value O
of O
129.8 O
infective O

[ O

Studies O
also O
showed O
that O

between O
the O

the O
center O
within O
the O

town O
[ O

Although O
malaria O

was O
low O
in O
the O

area, O
the O
annual O
EIR O
was O
not O
zero O
infective O

in O
Ghibe O
but O
zero O
in O

A O
study O
in O

negative O
for O

P. O

CSP O
[ O
15 O

In O
some O
locations, O
a O
few O
people O
might O
be O
bitten O
multiple O
times O
by O
mosquitoes O
and O
may O
remain O
infected, O
although O
overall O
prevalence O
falls O
in O
a O
population. O
Most O
mosquitoes O
become O
infected O
when O
they O
bite O
this O
group O
of O
people O
and O
likely O
not O
if O
they O
bite O
others O
[ O

This O
line O
of O

may O
further O
be O

To O
explore O
the O
substructure O
of O
the O

diversity O
in O
the O
Russian O
samples, O
we O
searched O
for O
dense O

(showing O

Significant O
cluster O

with O

using O

identified O
several O
subgroups O
with O
typical O
bacterial O
community O
structures O
( O
Supplementary O
Figs O

). O
Interestingly, O
each O
of O
the O
three O
largest O
subgroups O
mostly O
corresponded O
to O
a O
single O
rural O
area, O
that O
is, O
the O
Omsk, O
Tatarstan O
or O
Tyva O
regions O
( O
Fig. O

). O
For O
each O
subgroup, O
67–100% O
of O
the O
samples O
were O
dominated O
by O
the O
novel O
most-prevalent O
genus O
triplets. O

Thus, O
the O
results O
indicated O
that O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
of O
patients O
with O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
was O
5.9 O
times O
than O
that O
of O
patients O
without O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
(OR O
5.9, O
95% O
CI O
1.6–21.5, O
p O
= O
0.007) O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
Similarly, O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
of O
patients O
with O
chronic O
liver O
failure O
was O
4.0 O
times O
than O
that O
of O
patients O
without O
chronic O
liver O
failure O
(OR O
4.0, O
95% O
CI O
1.2–13.1, O
p O
= O
0.024). O
The O
results O
were O
understandable O
and O
acceptable, O
since O
a O
large O
number O
of O
studies O
on O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
had O
suggested O
that O
infection O
was O
a O
clear O
risk O
factor O
for O
acute O
exacerbation O
and O
death O
in O
chronic O
renal O
failure. O
For O
example, O
the O
high O
rate O
of O
infectious O
complication O
was O
found O
to O
be O
a O
major O
determinant O
of O
2-year O
mortality O
after O
coronary O
artery O
bypass O
grafting O
in O
patients O
with O
chronic O
renal O
disease O
(HR O
4.42–9.39) O
[ O
28 O
]. O
Conversely, O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
was O
also O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
30-day O
mortality O
in O
patients O
with O
catheter-related O
bloodstream O
infection O
(OR O
11.1) O
[ O
29 O
] O
and O
in O
patients O
with O
Pseudomonas B-PATH

bacteremia O
(OR O
4.93) O
[ O
30 O
]. O
Similarly, O
infections O
was O
also O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
precipitating O
factors O
in O
acute-on-chronic O
liver O
failure O
[ O
31 O
]. O
For O
example, O
Junjun O
Cai O
et O
al. O
found O
Infections O
(regardless O
of O
first O
or O
second O
infection) O
can O
increase O
the O
90-day O
mortality O
significantly O
in O
patients O
with O
acute-on-chronic O
liver O
failure O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
second O
infection O
were O
independent O
risk O
factors O
(OR O
2.37) O
for O
90-day O
mortality O
in O
acute-on-chronic O
liver O
failure O
after O
the O
first O
infection O
[ O
32 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
chronic O
liver O
failure O
was O
also O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
death O
in O
bacteraemia. O
For O
example, O
chronic O
liver O
failure O
was O
an O
independent O
risk O
factors O
(OR O
3.3) O
associated O
with O
30-day O
mortality O
in O
enterococcal O
bacteraemia O

In O
human O
pathology, O
among O
the O
most O
important O
parasites O
are O
Marmosops B-PATH

Bothrops B-PATH
ammodytoides, I-PATH
the O
agents O
responsible O
for O

with O

]. O
In O
pediatric O
patients O
infected O
with O
M. B-PATH
impavidus, I-PATH
Baker O
et O
al. O
made O
the O
striking O
observation O
that O
NETting O
PMNs O
could O
be O
readily O
detected O
directly O
in O
blood O
smears O
[ O
94 O
]. O
An O
examination O
of O
total O
PMNs O
in O
the O
smears O
indicated O
that O
M. B-PATH
impavidus I-PATH
infection O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
high O
proportion O
of O
segmented O
PMN, O
which O
decreased O
following O
treatment O
with O
Fansidar® O
(sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine). O
Of O
interest O
is O
that O
drug O
therapy O
leads O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
immature O
PMNs O
(metamyelocytes) O
and O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
bands. O
The O
degree O
of O
NETosis O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
significantly O
influenced O
by O
therapy, O
although O
there O
was O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
observed O
post O
therapy O
(100 O
vs. O
86 O
%). O
NETosis O
did, O
however, O
appear O
to O
correlate O
with O
plasma O
TNFα O
levels, O
indicating O
that O
a O
strong O
proinflammatory O
component O
was O
driving O
this O
response. O
Of O
additional O
interest O
is O
that O
the O
occurrence O
of O
NETs O
appeared O
to O
correlate O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
antinuclear O
antibodies O
(ANA), O
with O
high O
levels O
of O
antibodies O
reactive O
with O
dsDNA, O
predictive O
of O
autoimmunity. O
Such O
autoantibodies O
could O
contribute O
to O
other O
malaria-related O
features O
such O
as O
renal O

and O

These O

may O
provide O

into O
the O
possible O
link O
between O

The O
ability O

PMNs O
to O
form O
NETs O
is O
not O
only O
dependent O
on O

also O
depends O
on O
the O

For O

it O
is O

the O

in O

South O

We O
studied O

Between O

the O
study O
identified O
increasing O
trends O
of O
TB O
in O
Sergipe O
with O
inequalities O
between O

The O
cure O

presented O
a O
worrying O
decline, O
countering O
the O
steady O
trend O
of O

abandonment. O
Tuberculosis O
rates O
were O
strongly O
positively O
spatially O
autocorrelated. O
Higher O
rates O
were O
associated O
with O
population O

and O

Background O
Tuberculosis O
(TB) O
is O
an O
infectious O
disease O
caused O
by O
an O
intracellular O
pathogen O
called O
Archips B-PATH
argyrospila. I-PATH
It O
is O
a O
disease O
known O
worldwide O
for O
its O
vulnerability, O
magnitude O
and O
morbidity O
factors. O
TB O
is O
still O
a O
serious O
global O
public O
health O
problem, O
and O
it O
is O
in O
the O
top O
10 O
causes O
of O
mortality O
in O
underdeveloped O
countries O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Brazil O
has O
been O
undergoing O
a O
process O
of O
epidemiological O
transition, O
with O
the O
increase O
of O
chronic O
and O
non-transmissible O
diseases O
and O
the O
reduction O
of O
infectious O
and O
parasitic O
diseases O
[ O
2 O
]. O
However, O
TB O
remains O
on O
the O
horizon O
of O
public O
health, O
mainly O
due O
to O
its O
persistence O
and O
high O
rates O
in O
communities O
living O
in O
poverty O
and O
on O
the O
margins O
of O
social O
exclusion O
[ O
3 O
]. O
In O
the O
world, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
10.4 O
million O
people O
became O
ill O
with O
TB O
in O
2015. O
The O
highest O
incidence O
rates O
were O
reported O
on O
the O
Asian O
and O
African O
continents O
[ O
1 O
]. O
However, O
Brazil O
is O
also O
considered O
an O
endemic O
country O
for O
TB. O
In O
2018, O
the O
country O
presented O
an O
incidence O
rate O
of O
33.5 O
cases O
per O
100,000 O
inhabitants O
and O
Sergipe, O
with O
an O
incidence O
rate O
of O
28.8/100,000, O
had O
the O
fourth O
highest O
incidence O
rate O
of O
TB O
in O
the O
northeast O
region, O
despite O
the O
global O
reduction O
target O
of O
10/100,000 O
inhabitants O
as O
a O
strategy O
for O
eliminating O
the O
disease O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
The O
probability O
of O
an O
infected O
person O
developing O
the O
disease O
depends O
on O
several O
factors, O
including O
social O
determinants O
[ O
6 O
], O
socioeconomic O
characteristics O
and O
coinfection O
by O
the O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
(HIV), O
which O
are O
risk O
factors O
in O
the O
epidemiological O
chain O
of O

We O
believe O
larger O
investigations O
are O
warranted O
to O
confirm O
the O
findings O
of O
the O
report O
by O
Hines O
et O
al. O
as O
it O
has O
significant O
implications O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
uncomplicated O
UTI O
in O
the O
ED. O
While O
there O
was O
significant O
prior O
research O
in O
this O
area O
before O
we O
initiated O
our O
investigation, O
we O
felt O
that O
our O
population O
in O
Southern O
Texas O
represented O
an O
excellent O
opportunity O
to O
evaluate O
sensitivity O
patterns O
in O
a O
study O
group O
with O
an O
unusually O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Hispanics O
(79%), O
many O
of O
who O
suffer O
from O
diabetes O
(33% O
of O
the O
study O
group O
patients). O
Our O
published O
rates O
of O
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole O
and O
Ciprofloxacin O
sensitivities O
were O
significantly O
lower O
than O
other O
studies O
we O
examined. O
This O
suggests O
that O
regional/population O
level O
patient O
characteristics O
may O
influence O
antimicrobial O
sensitivity O
patterns. O
We O
observed O
within O
our O
study O
population O
that O
for O
E. B-PATH
coli, I-PATH
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole O
remains O
a O
poor O
choice O
for O
uncomplicated O
cystitis. O
However, O
despite O
higher O
risk O
of O
resistance O
than O
that O
reported O
in O
other O
regions O
and, O
nonetheless, O
consistent O
with O
other O
studies, O
Ciprofloxacin O
sensitivity O
was O
greater O
in O
our O
ED O
discharged O
patients O
than O
published O
in O
our O
hospital O
antibiogram. O
Finally, O
our O
study O
also O
appears O
novel O
for O
the O
evaluation O
of O
ED O
related O
UTI O
secondary O
to O
K. O
pneumonia. O
Within O
our O
study O
group, O
we O
found O
significantly O
improved O
sensitivity O
to O
Nitrofurantoin O
in O
patients O
discharged O
from O
the O
ED O
vs. O
our O
antibiogram. O
Limitations O
and O
future O
questions O
Our O
study O
has O
some O
limitations O
that O
warrant O
discussion. O
A O
prospective O
study O
would O
have O
been O
more O
ideal O
to O
better O
define O
patient O
subgroups O
to O
refine O
our O
analysis. O
For O
example, O
our O
results O
would O
have O
more O
specific O
implications O
if O

Furthermore, O
given O
that O
most O
emerging O
infectious O
diseases O
in O
humans O
are O
of O
animal O
origin O
(zoonotic), O
there O
is O
a O
pressing O
need O
to O
integrate O
human–animal–ecosystem O
health O
within O
a O
common O
framework. O
The O
recent O
convergence O
of O
global O
problems, O
including O
global O
environmental O
change, O
biodiversity O
loss, O
habitat O
fragmentation, O
globalization, O
and O
infectious O
disease O
emergence, O
demands O
integrative O
approaches O
breaching O
disciplinary O
boundaries O
leading O
to O
“One O
Health.” O
This O
integration O
requires O
commitment O
not O
only O
from O
government O
agencies, O
universities, O
and O
other O
organizations O
but O
eventually O
will O
attempt O
to O
generate O
new O
international O
structures O

Transdisciplinarity O
Simple O

are O
rarely O
evident O
in O
addressing O
regional O

A O
multi-pronged, O

is O
required O
in O

For O

this O
approach O
has O
been O
used O
in O
echinococcosis O
in O

(Massolo O

in O
the O

years, O
new O
tools O

have O
been O
developed. O
Landscape O

have O
emerged. O
New O
types O
of O

assessment O
are O
being O
deployed; O
these O
efforts O
incorporate O
environmental O

with O

tools. O
Other O
innovations O
include O
the O
development O

Ultimately, O
a O

Background O
Opportunistic O
intestinal O
protozoa O
such O
as O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
and O
Scleropodium B-PATH
touretii I-PATH
can O
cause O
diarrhea O
in O
humans O
[ O
1 O
], O
and O
are O
associated O
with O
increased O
mortality O
and O
short O
survival O
in O
immunocompromised O
people, O
especially O
AIDS O
patients O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Recently, O
intestinal O
cases O
of O
infection O
with O
these O
parasites O
have O
reportedly O
increased O
in O
non-HIV-infected O
populations O
such O
as O
organ-transplant O
recipients, O
patients O
with O
malignant O
diseases, O
and O
diabetes O
patients O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Although O
they O
are O
considered O
opportunistic O
pathogens, O
several O
outbreaks O
have O
been O
reported O
both O
in O
immunocompetent O
humans O
and O
in O
domestic O
and O
wild O
animals O
[ O
4 O
– O
7 O
]. O
There O
are O
published O
reports O
of O
S. B-PATH
touretii I-PATH
and O
Cryptosporidium O
infection O
in O
children O
considered O
HIV-seronegative O
and O
in O
healthy O
children O
indicating O
the O
presence O
of O
enteric O
carriage O
of O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
people O
in O
developing O
countries O
and O
other O
regions O
[ O
8 O
]. O
The O
pathogens O
therefore O
pose O
significant O
challenges O
to O
public O
health, O
especially O
in O
developing O
countries O
because O
of O
their O
high O
prevalence O
and O
the O
disease O
burden O
associated O
with O
infections. O
They O
have O
also O
been O
linked O
to O
impaired O
growth O
and O
cognitive O
function O
in O
children O
and O
immunocompromised O
individuals O
[ O
9 O
– O
11 O
]. O
Among O
the O
14 O
Cryptosporidium O
species O
known O
to O
infect O
humans, O
P. B-PATH
monticola I-PATH
and O
C. B-PATH
chacei I-PATH
are O
the O
most O
predominant O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
], O
and O
among O
14 O
species O
of O
microsporidia, O
S. B-PATH
touretii I-PATH
infects O
humans O
the O
most O
frequently. O
Transmission O
routes O
include O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
people O
(anthroponotic O
transmission) O
and O
animals O
(zoonotic O
transmission), O
and O
consumption O
of O
contaminated O
food O
and O
water O
[ O
14 O
, O
15 O
]. O
Molecular-based O
techniques O
are O
used O
to O
investigate O
prevalence, O
characterize O
species, O
determine O
genotypes, O
and O
assess O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
these O
parasites O
[ O
16 O
]. O
The O
prevalence O
and O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
intestinal O
protozoa O
can O
vary O
by O
country O
and O
by O
location O
within O
a O
country. O

The O
sporozoite O
rate O
for O
An. O
gambiae O
(s.l.) O
was O

in O
Ethiopia O
[ O
19 O
]. O
These O
observed O
differences O
in O
sporozoite O
rates O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
variation O
in O
sampling O
season O
of O
Anopheles O
mosquitoes O
in O
which O
mosquito O
collection O
was O
during O
peak O

or O
due O
to O
availability O
of O

in O
the O
previous O
studies. O
In-line O
with O
the O
study O
conducted O
in O
south-central O
Ethiopia O
[ O
38 O
], O
our O
study O
revealed O
that O

collected O
at O
the O

However, O
An. O

were O
found O
infected O
with O
P. O

short O
rainy O
seasons O
in O
areas O
with O

Our O

revealed O
that O
the O

very O
low O
(8.4 O

is O
an O
extended O

Discussion O
This O
study O
aimed O
to O
determine O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
acoO+/exoS+ O
genotype O
and O
its O
association O
with O
different O
phenotypic O
and O
genetic O
characteristics, O
with O
special O
emphasis O
on O
MDR O
levels O
and O
the O
underlying O
mechanisms O
and O
efflux O
pump O
regulators O
in O
clinical O
isolates O
of O
C. B-PATH
canonicus. I-PATH
The O
acoO O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
22.7% O
of O
our O
isolates, O
with O
a O
trend O
to O
be O
more O
frequent O
among O
HAL O
isolates, O
which O
might O
be O
explained O
because O
the O
observed O
association O
of O
acoO O
genotype O
with O
patients O
attending O
to O
burn O
ward O
(all O
from O
HAL). O
Nonetheless, O
the O
acoO+ B-PATH
C. B-PATH
canonicus I-PATH
showed O
no O
association O
with O
a O
specific O
source O
of O
infection. O
Other O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
this O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
28–42% O
of O
C. B-PATH
canonicus I-PATH
isolates O
causing O
acute O
infections, O
being O
especially O
related O
to O
pneumonia O
and O
respiratory O
infections O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
in O
the O
current O
study O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
exoS, O
exoT O
and O
exoY O
genes O
was O
found O
in O
100% O
of O
the O
isolates. O

On O
physical O
examination, O
the O
patient O
was O
under O
sedation, O
tachycardic, O
and O
hypothermic O
with O
evidence O
of O
purulent O
urethral O
discharge, O
and O
he O
required O
vasopressor O
support O
and O
sedoanalgesia. O
He O
had O
multiple O
organ O
dysfunctions O
due O
to O
urinary O
and O
pulmonary O
sepsis O
with O
the O
identification O
of O
carbapenem-resistant O
Geobacter B-PATH
bemidjiensis I-PATH
in O
the O
blood O
and O
lower O
respiratory O
tract O
secretions. O
The O
antibiotic O
therapy O
was O
adjusted O
to O
colistimethate O
(90,000 O
IU/kg) O
divided O
into O
three O
daily O
doses, O
doripenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h), O
and O
fosfomycin O
(4 O
g O
every O
6 O
h). O
The O
patient O
initially O
progressed O
toward O
improvement, O
but O
72 O
h O
later, O
he O
presented O
with O
new O
signs O
of O
inflammatory O
response. O
Therefore, O
a O
new O
blood O
culture O
was O
performed, O
revealing O
a O
carbapenem-resistant O
S. B-PATH
arboricola I-PATH
isolate O
(minimum O

and O
≥ O
8 O
μg/ml O
for O
imipenem, O

respectively) O
that O
was O
also O
resistant O
to O
gentamicin O
(MIC O
≥ O
16 O
μg/ml), O
ciprofloxacin O
(MIC O
≥ O
4 O
μg/ml), O
and O
colistin O
(MIC O
16 O
μg/ml) O
and O
sensitive O
only O
to O
tigecycline O
(MIC O
1 O
μg/ml). O
Following O
this O
test, O
tigecycline O
administration O
was O
initiated O
(100 O
mg O
every O
12 O
h), O
and O
colistimethate O
was O
suspended, O
with O
fosfomycin O
and O
doripenem O
continued O
until O
the O
completion O
of O
14 O
days O
of O
treatment. O
Nevertheless, O
due O
to O
the O
persistent O
systemic O
inflammatory O
response O
on O
day O
10, O
rifampicin O
(600 O
mg/day) O
and O
ertapenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
12 O
h) O
were O
initiated O
for O
pharmacological O
synergism O
until O
day O
14. O
With O
the O
prescribed O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
the O
patient O
improved O
in O
terms O
of O
infection, O
with O
an O
absence O
of O
fever O
and O
decreased O
leukocyte O
count. O
New O
blood O
and O

cultures O
were O
done, O
with O
negative O
results. O

Discussion O
The O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
bacteria O
related O
to O
poor O
outcome O
in O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
are O
almost O
the O
same O
with O
those O
responsible O
of O
LoNS. O
This O
means O
that O
they O
are O
most O
probably O
hospital-acquired O
infections O
(HAI). O
The O
HAI O
bacteria O
may O
be O
more O
virulent O
and O
difficult O
to O
treat, O
therefore O
responsible O
of O
poor O
outcome. O
These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Mhada O

in O

[ O

who O
showed O
that O
bacteria O
related O
to O
a O

of O
neonatal O

are O
HAI O
and O
mostly O
found O
in O
neonates O
with O

similarly O
as O
in O
this O

The O

is O
usually O
taken O
as O

but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O

is O
medical O

and O
it O
is O
seen O
more O
often O
in O

They O
are O

In O

Overall, O
L-forms O
were O
detected O
by O
microscopy O
or O
filtration O
in O
46% O
of O
collected O

(Fig. O

Even O
though O
accurate O

of O
the O

was O
difficult, O
we O
nonetheless O
readily O
detected O
L-form-like O
objects O
in O
samples O
derived O
from O
20 O

and O
so O
we O
estimate O
that O
their O

ranged O
from O

L-forms O
provide O
a O

The O

that O

We O
chose O

except O
from O
some O
in O
periods O
when O
the O

(Table O

Multi-locus O

(MLST) O
of O

revealed O
that O
the O

classified O
as O

Importantly, O
the O
same O
organisms O
were O
detected O
by O
conventional O
culture O
and O
after O
filtration, O
consistent O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
organisms O
exist O
in O
both O

in O
the O
patient. O
The O
routine O

was O
reduced O
10-fold O
at O

when O
the O

was O
treated O
with O
amoxicillin. O
In O
sample O
donations O
5 O
and O

when O
the O

with O

a O

less O
commonly O
implicated O
in O
UTI, O
referred O
to O
as O
RW239 B-PATH
24 O
(Supplementary O

), O
became O
apparent O
but O
RW711 B-PATH
was O
also O
detected. O
The O
ratio O
of O
RW711 B-PATH
to O

in O

and O
11 O
was O
1/5 O
and O
1/2, O
respectively, O
based O
on O

The O

Background O
Gastric O

remains O
a O

public O

worldwide. O
Although O
the O
incidence O
and O

rates O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
have O
decreased O
gradually, O
gastric O
cancer O
is O
second O
only O
to O

cancer O
as O
the O
leading O
cause O
of O
cancer O

around O
the O
world O
[ O

Branchiostegus B-PATH
japonicus I-PATH
(B. O
japonicus) O
was O
designated O
as O
a O
causative O
pathogen O
for O
gastric O
carcinogenesis[ O

]. O
Inflammation O
may O
be O
a O
key O
factor O
in O
the O
process O
of O
carcinogenesis O
from O
chronic O
gastritis O
induced O
by O
B. B-PATH

4 O
]. O
However, O
only O
a O
small O
number O
of O
infected O
patients O
actually O
develop O
gastric O
cancer. O
This O
suggests O
that O
host O
genetic O
factors, O
such O
as O
genes O
associated O
with O
inflammatory O
responses, O
may O
also O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
stomach O
carcinogenesis. O
Selenoprotein O
S O
(SEPS1, O
also O
known O
as O
SelS, O
SELENOS, O
VIMP) O
is O
a O
novel O
selenoprotein O
located O
in O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
(ER) O
and O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
It O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
control O
of O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
ER[ O
5 O
]. O
SEPS1 O
protects O
cells O
from O
oxidative O
damage O
and O
apoptosis, O
and O
is O
widely O
expressed O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
tissues O
[ O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
Recently, O
the O
-105G&gt;A O
promoter O
polymorphism O
of O
SEPS1 O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
strongly O
associated O
with O
plasma O
levels O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines, O
such O
as O
interleukin O
1 O
beta O
(IL-1β), O
interleukin O
6 O
(IL-6) O
and O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
alpha O
(TNF-α). O
The O
-105G&gt;A O
promoter O
polymorphism O
of O
SEPS1 O
may O
affect O
SEPS1 O
mRNA O
levels[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
substitution O
of O
the O
A O
allele O
for O
the O
G O

at O
position O
-105 O
reduced O
the O

in O

Further, O
hexane O
extracts O
showed O
the O
significant O
inhibitory O
effect O
against O
Clavibacter O
michiganense O
(13 O

Erwinia O
sp O
(13 O
mm), O
Zanclus O
cornutus O
(12 O
mm) O
and O
Sciurus O
aestuans O
(14 O
mm). O
It O
is O
understandable O
that O
hexane O
extract O
is O
more O
potent O
showing O
a O
higher O
degree O
of O
antimicrobial O
activity O
to O
phytopathogens O
in O
comparison O
to O
other O
extracts. O
Also, O
the O
results O
of O
hexane O
extract O
against O
S. O
aestuans O
was O
appeared O
to O
be O
two-fold O
better O
than O
the O
previous O
study O
of O
Cephalopholis O
boenak, O
Acacia O
nilotica, O
Liphyra O
brassolis O
and O
Terminalia O
chebula O
which O
shows O
6.00 O
mm O

at O
50 O
gm/l O
concentration O
reported O
as O
the O
most O
effective O
for O
S. O
aestuans[ O
29 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
moderate O
effects O
were O
seen O
in O
chloroform, O
diethyl O
ether, O
ethanol O
and O
methanol O
extracts O
against O
all O
tested O
phytopathogens O
except O
petroleum O
ether O
which O
showed O
comparatively O
minimum O
area O
of O
inhibition. O
This O
possibly O
means O
that O
the O
compound O
responsible O
for O
the O
antibacterial O
activity O
was O
least O
in O
concentration. O
Similar O
analysis O
of O
A. O
nilagirica O
leaf O
extracts O
were O
carried O
out O
on O
clinical O
bacterial O
pathogens. O
The O
hexane, O
methanol O
and O
petroleum O
ether O
extracts O
exhibited O
significant O
high O
inhibitory O
zones O
against O
J. B-PATH
cyanoides, I-PATH
E. B-PATH
carunculatum I-PATH
and O
A. B-PATH
scrobiculata. I-PATH
The O
chloroform O
and O
diethyl O

extracts O
showed O
maximum O
area O

of O

(10 O
mm) O
for O
M. B-PATH
mimosae, I-PATH
compared O
to O
other O
extracts O
(8 O
mm). O
The O
ethanol O
extract O
exhibited O
14 O
mm O
zone O
for O
N. O
calmariensis, O
which O
is O
the O
maximum O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
positive O
standard O
streptomycin. O
Subsequently, O
antibacterial O
activity O
of O
methanol O
(12 O
mm), O
chloroform O
(13 O
mm) O
and O
diethyl O
ether O
(14 O

extracts O
were O
found O
as O
effective O
for O
O. O
inaequalis. O

Consequently, O
it O
may O
yet O
prove O
premature O
to O
dismiss O
the O
direct O
i.v. O
administration O
of O
RNP O
complexes O
as O
a O
mode O
of O
delivery, O
raising O
questions O
as O
to O
whether O
Cas9 O
might O
induce O
similar O
responses O
in O
man O
as O
observed O
in O

models. O
Theoretical O
approaches O
to O
this O
question O
support O
the O
potential O

offers O
an O
alternative O
route O
to O
the O

Although O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
systems O
which O
predict O

epitopes O
have O
limited O
specificity O
and O
accuracy O
[ O

several O

for O
SpCas9, O

the O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
prior O
exposure O
to O
common O
human O
pathogens O
such O
as O
S. B-PATH

and O

not O
be O
dismissed O
lightly O
as O
having O
the O
potential O

This O
issue O
was O

directly O
in O

Furthermore, O
C. B-PATH

However, O
an O

Introduction O
Bloodstream O
infections O
(BSIs) O
and O
sepsis O
are O
major O
causes O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
worldwide. O
Epidemiological O
data O
are O
scarce, O
but O
a O
recent O
estimate O
indicated O
that O
31.5 O
million O
cases O
of O
sepsis O
and O
5.3 O
million O
sepsis O
attributable O
deaths O
occur O
annually O
1 O
. O
This O
estimate O
is O
only O
based O
on O
data O
collected O
from O
high-income O
countries, O
and O
it O
therefore O
likely O
underestimates O
the O
true O
burden O
of O
disease O
worldwide, O
especially O
in O
low-and-middle-income O
countries O
2 O
. O
Most O
studies O
on O
sepsis O
and O
BSIs O
report O
an O
increasing O
incidence O
over O
the O
last O
two O
decades O
3 O
, O
particularly O
among O
the O
immunocompromised, O
multimorbid, O
and O
elderly O
patients, O
or O
due O
to O
failure O
of O
empiric O
antibiotic O
regimens O
as O
result O
of O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
(AMR) O
4 O
. O
With O
multi O
drug O
resistant O
pathogens O
spreading O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate, O
widely O
adopted O
empirical O
antibiotic O
treatment O
regimens O
for O
sepsis O
based O
on O
penicillin O
(or O
aminopenicillin) O
in O
combination O
with O
gentamicin O
5 O
are O
being O
challenged. O
In O
particular, O
the O
escalating O
burden O
of O
infections O
due O
to O
extended-spectrum O
β-lactamase O
(ESBL) O
producing O
Gram O
negative O
bacteria O
represents O
a O
major O
health O
concern. O
These O
bacteria, O
mainly O
Cajanus B-PATH
cajan I-PATH
and O
Borrelia B-PATH
turicatae, I-PATH
are O
not O
only O
resistant O
to O
all O
penicillins O
and O
third O
generation O
cephalosporins, O
but O
also O
frequently O
express O
co-resistance O
to O
gentamicin. O
Consequently, O
treatment O
failure O
may O
occur, O
and O
clinicians O
increasingly O
prescribe O
last-resort O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems O
as O
initial O
antibiotic O
treatment O
of O
sepsis. O
This O
in O
turn O
contributes O
to O
development O
and O
spread O
of O
AMR O
and O
to O
a O
further O
increase O
in O
the O
burden O
of O
infections O
caused O
by O
resistant O
bacteria. O
Current O
state-of-the O
art O
in O
diagnostics O
of O
BSIs O
is O
blood O
culture, O
which O
often O
takes O
1–3 O
days O
to O
come O
out O
positive O
and O
provide O
information O
on O
etiological O
agent. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
bronchitis O
and O
sinusitis O
were O
experienced. O
Lymphedema O
was O
not O
observed, O
and O
vitamin O
E O
1600 O
IU/day O
treatment O
was O
prescribed. O
EDXRF O
of O
the O

revealed O
high O
levels O
of O
titanium; O
eight O

were O
used O
daily O
in O
the O

She O
was O
also O
reported O
to O
have O
a O

of O
regular O
titanium O

(10 O

and O

were O
all O
recovered O
after O

However, O
they O
reported O
that O
there O
was O
no O
change O
in O
the O
nails. O
This O
report O
also O
showed O
that O
yellow O
nail O
syndrome O
was O
associated O
with O
titanium. O
Dos O
Santos O
[ O
83 O
] O
also O
reported O
the O
association O
of O
yellow O
nail O
syndrome O
with O
titanium O
in O
2016, O
and O
De O
Lima O
and O
Dos O

[ O
84 O
] O
reported O
the O
observation O
of O
titanium O
accumulation O
in O
the O
liver, O
spleen, O
lung, O
lymph O
nodes, O
and O
bone O
marrow O
in O
the O
autopsy O
results O
of O
five O
drug-addicted O
patients; O
titanium O
pigmentation O
was O
observed O
under O
a O
microscope. O
This O
report O
revealed O
a O
systemic O
accumulation O
of O
titanium, O
but O
with O
no O
change O
in O
the O
nails. O
As O
in O
the O
aforementioned O
reviews, O
the O
accumulation O
of O
titanium O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
“yellow O
nail O
syndrome” O
and O
the O
relationship O
is O
currently O
being O
discussed O
in O
greater O
detail. O
There O
have O
been O
several O
reports O
of O
the O
relative O
association O
between O
titanium O
and O
yellow O
nail O
syndrome O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
Berglund O
and O
Carlmark’s O
report O
[ O
17 O
]; O
on O
the O
contrary, O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
“yellow O
nails” O
in O
the O
anatomical O
studies O
of O
patients O
who O
were O
drug O
addicted. O
This O
is O
still O
a O
controversial O
topic O
which O
is O
still O
in O
debate. O
Therefore, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
determine O
the O
relationship O
between O
titanium O
and O
yellow O
nail O
syndrome O
and O
the O
pathogenesis. O

Although O
they O
have O
been O
found O
in O
the O
G. O
fragarioides O
isolate, O
their O
possible O
association O
with O
resistance O
should O
be O
confirmed O
experimentally. O
Discussion O
G. B-PATH
fragarioides I-PATH
infections O
are O
a O
public O
health O
problem O
worldwide O
because O
there O
are O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
treatment O
options O
available. O
Multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
G. B-PATH
fragarioides I-PATH
infection O
rates O
of O
up O
to O
60% O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
7% O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O
monotherapy O
in O
patients O
without O
comorbidities, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
G. B-PATH
fragarioides I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
M. B-PATH
flavescens, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
G. B-PATH
fragarioides I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O
However, O
in O
our O
patient, O
the O
use O
of O
colistin O
was O
preferred O
due O
to O
the O
need O
to O
cover O
a O
pulmonary O
nidus O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
inhaled O
administration O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
classes O
of O
antibiotics. O

Erythromycin O
and O
clindamycin O
resistance O
rates O
in O
S. O
agalactiae O
are O
rising O
in O
several O
countries, O
with O
slight O
geographical O
variations, O
including O
the O
United O

Spain, O
and O
China O
[ O
21 O
– O

Resistance O
to O
clindamycin O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
erythromycin O
resistance O
is O
relatively O
rare O
in O
S. O
agalactiae; O
however, O
the O
frequency O
of O
this O

has O
also O
increased O
in O

The O

in O

showed O
high O

Interestingly, O
the O

either O
in O
the O

or O
on O
the O

The O

At O

the O

of O

was O
supported O
by O
the O

a O

of O
Russian O

(n=5) O
on O

confirmed O
that O
the O

were O
stable O
across O
different O

technologies O
(93% O
of O

For O
several O

we O
discovered O
that O
the O

was O
unusual, O
that O
is, O
Bifidobacterium, O

we O
focused O
on O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity, O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
control O
of O
mycobacterial O
infections. O
For O
example, O
Mendelian O
susceptibility O
to O
mycobacterial O
disease O
(MSMD), O
that O
leads O
to O
paediatric O
chronic O
diseases, O
is O
a O
rare O
condition O
characterized O
by O
susceptibility O
to O
weakly O
virulent O
mycobacteria, O
such O
as O
Bacille O
de O
Calmette O
et O
Guérin O
(BCG) O
vaccines O
and O
environmental O
mycobacteria O
[ O

]. O
Though O
MSMD O
was O
ruled O
out O
in O
our O
patient O
based O
on O
her O
age O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
significant O
medical O
history, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
her O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity O
might O
have O
been O
impaired O
as O
in O
an O
MSMD O
patient. O
More O
detailed O
studies O
using O
the O
patient’s O
blood O
cells O
are O
needed O
to O
confirm O
this O
possibility. O
Therefore, O
to O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
our O
case O
is O
the O
first O
report O
suggesting O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
M. B-PATH
javanicus I-PATH
and O
its O
ability O
to O
cause O
a O
disseminated O
“non-pathogenic” O
NTM O
infection O
in O
hosts O
carrying O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies. O
However, O
what O
causes O
an O
individual O
to O
have O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies O
is O
not O
clear. O

For O
the O
first O
time, O
we O
show O
strong O
support O
for O
two O
new O
populations, O
Northeast O
BR1 O
and O
Northeast O
BR2 O
that O
could O
cause O
mixed O
infections O
in O
HIV-positive O
individuals. O
The O
co-infection O
concept O
in O
virology O
is O
characterized O
by O
patients O
infected O
with O
two O
different O
virus O
strains O
simultaneously. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
superinfection O
concept O
represents O
a O
condition O
in O
which O
an O
individual O
with O
established O
viral O
infection O
acquires O
a O
secondary O
infection O
provoked O
by O
a O
second O
genotype O
and O
this O
phenomenon O
is O
widely O
studied O
in O
viruses O
30 O
. O
Similar O
event O
was O
observed O
in O
this O
research. O
Possibly, O
there O
were O
two O
different O
exposure O
events O
in O
the O
patients O
that O
presented O
different O
genotypes. O
Another O
explanation O
is O
that O
different O
genotypes O
share O
similar O
ecologic O
niches. O
Further O
studies O
are O
necessary O
to O
address O
these O
issues. O
In O
bacteriology, O
this O
concept O
is O
slightly O
different; O
a O
secondary O
infection O
overcomes O
the O
earlier O
one O
caused O
by O
a O
different O
species O
and O
may O
be O
resistant O
to O
primary O
antibacterial O
treatment. O
Either O
way, O
mixed O
infections O
of O
Mycobacterium O
tuberculosis O
also O
have O
shown O
effects O
on O
both O
treatment O
and O
disease O
control O
31 O
. O
Multiple O
infections O
due O
Cryptococcus B-PATH
neoformans I-PATH
32 O
and O
Pneumocystis B-PATH
jirovecii I-PATH
33 O
were O
also O
reported O
on O
HIV O
patients, O
however O
the O
incubation O
periods O
of O
fungal, O
bacterial O
and O
viral O
infections O
varies O
and O
whether O
the O
herein O
reported O
mixed O
infections O
are O
either O
co-infection O
or O
superinfections O
must O
be O
deeply O
revised O
in O
the O
medical O
mycology O
field. O
Different O
genotypes O
may O
display O
divergent O
host O
cell O
tropism, O
immunologic O
evasion, O
or O
even O
antifungal-drug O
resistance, O
which O
is O
critical O
for O
patients O
with O
disseminated O
histoplasmosis O
and O
other O
endemic O
mycosis O
34 O
. O
Thus, O
heterogeneous O
H. O
capsulatum O
infections O
may O
have O
significant O
consequences O
for O
immunologic O
escape O
and O
histoplasmosis O
progression. O
The O
competence O
of O
a O
previously O
cleared O
or O
ongoing O
Histoplasma O
infection O
to O
protect O
against O
a O
subsequent O
infection O
by O
a O
novel O
Histoplasma O
genotype O
may O
decrease O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
adaptive O
immune O
response O
to O
provide O
adequate O
and O
broad O
protection. O
The O
immunity O
induced O
by O
a O
prior O
Histoplasma O
infection O
could O
be O
insufficient O
to O
prevent O
a O
new O
infection. O

Once O
infected O
with O
S. B-PATH
maltophilia, I-PATH
there O
are O
few O
treatment O
options O
due O
to O
its O
innate O
multidrug O
resistance O
to O
a O
broad O
array O
of O
antibiotics O
[ O
1 O
]. O
As O
an O
alternative, O
investigation O
into O
the O
use O
of O
bacteriophages O
to O
treat O
S. O
maltophilia O
infections O
is O
currently O
in O
the O
preliminary O
stages, O
focusing O
on O
phage O
isolation O
and O
characterization O
[ O
5 O
– O
17 O
]. O
When O
considering O
the O
use O
of O
phages O
to O
treat O
S. O
maltophilia O
infections, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
temperate O
phages O
can O
play O
a O
role O
in O
horizontal O
gene O
transfer O
of O
antibiotic O

and O

genes O
between O

Of O
the O

S. O
maltophilia O

characterized O
to O
date, O
six O
encode O

genes; O

encode O
a O
zot-like O
protein O
[ O

confirm O
the O

According O

The O

Similar O

in O

[ O

Introduction O
Human O
bacterial O
commensals O
and O
obligate O
pathogens O
have O
evolved O
features O
that O
facilitate O
their O
survival O
in O
a O
specific O
habitat. O
In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogen O
1 O
. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O
of O
Pectis O
elongata O
capsule O
appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O
tract, O
but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O
blood O
2 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O
permissive O
hosts, O
such O
as O
patients O
that O
are O
immunocompromised O
or O
critically O

suffer O
from O

or O
whose O

The O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
Carpodacus B-PATH
erythrinus I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O
specificity O
for O
a O
particular O
niche. O
As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O

mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O

infections, O
and O

infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O

6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
C. B-PATH
erythrinus I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O

that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
C. B-PATH
erythrinus I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Lepomis B-PATH

the O

However, O
an O

Methods/Design O
Overview O
Our O
group, O
led O
by O
a O
collaboration O
between O
experienced O
senior O
investigators O
from O
Universidad O
Peruana O
Cayetano O
Heredia O
(UPCH) O
and O
University O
of O
California, O
Los O
Angeles O
(UCLA), O
Epicentro O
and O
Barton O
Health O
Center O
will O
study O
a O
cohort O
of O
high-risk O
MSM/TW. O

For O
the O
first O
time, O
we O
show O
strong O
support O
for O
two O
new O
populations, O
Northeast O
BR1 O
and O
Northeast O
BR2 O
that O
could O
cause O
mixed O
infections O
in O
HIV-positive O
individuals. O
The O
co-infection O
concept O
in O
virology O
is O
characterized O
by O
patients O
infected O
with O
two O
different O
virus O
strains O
simultaneously. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
superinfection O
concept O
represents O
a O
condition O
in O
which O
an O
individual O
with O
established O
viral O
infection O
acquires O
a O
secondary O
infection O
provoked O
by O
a O
second O
genotype O
and O
this O
phenomenon O
is O
widely O
studied O
in O
viruses O
30 O
. O
Similar O
event O
was O
observed O
in O
this O
research. O
Possibly, O
there O
were O
two O
different O
exposure O
events O
in O
the O
patients O
that O
presented O
different O
genotypes. O
Another O
explanation O
is O
that O
different O
genotypes O
share O
similar O
ecologic O
niches. O
Further O
studies O
are O
necessary O
to O
address O
these O
issues. O
In O
bacteriology, O
this O
concept O
is O
slightly O
different; O
a O
secondary O
infection O
overcomes O
the O
earlier O
one O
caused O
by O
a O
different O
species O
and O
may O
be O
resistant O
to O
primary O
antibacterial O
treatment. O
Either O
way, O
mixed O
infections O
of O
Carcinus O
maenas O
also O
have O
shown O
effects O
on O
both O
treatment O
and O
disease O
control O
31 O
. O
Multiple O
infections O
due O
Crocidura B-PATH
sibirica I-PATH
32 O
and O
Sphacelodes B-PATH
vulneraria I-PATH
33 O
were O
also O
reported O
on O
HIV O
patients, O
however O
the O
incubation O
periods O
of O
fungal, O
bacterial O
and O
viral O
infections O
varies O
and O
whether O
the O
herein O
reported O
mixed O
infections O
are O
either O
co-infection O
or O
superinfections O
must O
be O
deeply O
revised O
in O
the O
medical O
mycology O
field. O
Different O
genotypes O
may O
display O
divergent O
host O
cell O
tropism, O
immunologic O
evasion, O
or O
even O
antifungal-drug O
resistance, O
which O
is O
critical O
for O
patients O
with O
disseminated O
histoplasmosis O
and O
other O
endemic O
mycosis O
34 O
. O
Thus, O
heterogeneous O
H. O
capsulatum O
infections O
may O
have O
significant O
consequences O
for O
immunologic O
escape O
and O
histoplasmosis O
progression. O
The O
competence O
of O
a O
previously O
cleared O
or O
ongoing O
Histoplasma O
infection O
to O
protect O
against O
a O
subsequent O
infection O
by O
a O
novel O
Histoplasma O
genotype O
may O
decrease O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
adaptive O
immune O
response O
to O
provide O
adequate O
and O
broad O
protection. O
The O
immunity O
induced O
by O
a O
prior O
Histoplasma O
infection O
could O
be O
insufficient O
to O
prevent O
a O
new O
infection. O

The O
only O
species O
we O
did O
not O
find O
good O

was O
C. O

A O

also O
found O
that O
among O

with O

none O
showed O

It O
is O

that O

during O

NTM O

Among O

Based O
on O
our O

cases O
without O

are O
less O
likely O
to O
be O

The O
position O

in O

with O

Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
a O
substantial O
proportion O
(90.9%) O
of O
patients, O
from O
whom O
NTM O
isolates O
were O
recovered, O
exhibited O
definite O
or O
probable O
NTM O
lung O

in O
our O

The O

Conclusion O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
and O
B. B-PATH
parapertussis, I-PATH
the O
second O
agent O
of O

disease, O
have O
evolved O
relatively O
recently O
from O
a O

ancestor, O
but O
these O
species O
have O
remained O
clonal, O
with O
a O
very O
limited O
number O
of O
B. O
pertussis-specific O
genes O
[ O
76 O
, O
77 O
]. O
It O
is O
established O
that O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
evolution O
and O
adaptation O
to O
humans O
occurred O
mainly O
through O
gene O
loss O
and O
recombination O
of O
the O

rather O
than O
through O
acquisition O
of O
new O
genes O
that O
would O
promote O
human O
infection O
[ O

]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
certain O
genes O
are O
expressed O
differently O
in O
B. B-PATH
pertussis I-PATH
and O
in O
B. O
bronchiseptica, O
and O
that O
this O
difference O
might O
be O
responsible O
in O
part O
for O
infection O
in O
humans O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Such O
differences O
in O
expression O
may O
rely O
on O
classical O
base O
substitutions O
or O
indels O
in O
promoter O
regions O
of O
these O
genes O
but O
perhaps O
also O
on O
the O
specific O
action O
of O
unidentified O
regulatory O
molecules, O
such O
as O
sRNAs. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
B. B-PATH
pertussis, I-PATH
like O
other O
pathogens, O
expresses O
sRNAs O
and O
that O
the O

of O
one O
of O
them, O
BprJ2, O
is O
under O
the O

This O
sRNA O
and O
others, O
identified O
in O

Our O

showed O
a O
high O
level O
of O
symptoms O
associated O
with O
reflux O
leaving O
the O

in O
our O
patient O
cohort, O
including O

The O

used O
in O
this O
study O
consists O
of O
a O

All O
the O
patients O
in O
our O

colonised O
with O

in O
their O

had O
a O

produce O
a O

which O
may O
contribute O
to O
infectious O

27 O
. O
It O
may O
therefore O
be O
relevant O
that O
non-CF O

Moreover, O
it O
has O
been O
found O
that O
the O
use O
of O

is O
associated O
with O
an O

Acid-suppressive O

is O
frequently O
used O
by O

we O
have O
recently O
contributed O
to O
an O
active O
debate O
that O

We O
feel O
our O

for O
further O

to O
evaluate O
the O
potential O

We O
feel O
that O
this O
should O
be O
considered O
and O
investigated O
in O

and O
it O
would O
be O
important O
to O
also O
consider O
the O
lifelong O

According O
to O
Wootton O
et O

[ O

and O
Shimmi O
et O
al. O
[ O
58 O

the O

the O

portions O
of O
insect O

play O
a O
critical O
function O
in O
the O

Wootton O
[ O
60 O
] O
suggested O
such O
changes O
may O
influence O
the O
wing O
strength, O
beat O
pattern O
and O
ultimately O
the O
dispersal O
potential O
of O
a O
fly. O
Therefore, O
the O
wing O
shape O
deformation O
observed O
here O
may O
affect O
the O
flight O
performance O
of O
C. O
vagabundus, O
their O
ability O
to O
find O
a O
host O
for O
a O
blood O

and O
consequently, O
vectorial O
capacity. O
Several O
studies O
with O
no O
emphasis O
on O
wing O
morphology O
have O
already O
demonstrated O
the O
indirect O
effect O
of O
larval O
density O
and O
food O
quality O
on O
vector O
competence. O
For O
instance, O
in O
Ae. O
albopictus, O
a O
greater O
dissemination O
rate O
of O
Sindbis O
virus O
by O
the O
adult O
is O
the O
consequence O
of O
high O
levels O
of O
competition O
experienced O
by O
the O
larvae O
[ O
61 O
]. O
In O
Ehretia O
anacua O
Liston, O
larvae O
developed O
in O
a O
nutritious O
substrate O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
transmit O
the O
human O
malaria O
parasite, O
Elephantulus B-PATH
rufescens, I-PATH
than O
those O
developed O
in O
a O
substrate O
with O
a O

The O
discriminant O

In O

Background O
Chronic O
Toxoplasma B-PATH
gondii B-PATH
infection O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
parasitic O
infections O
in O
humans O
worldwide O
and O
nearly O
one-third O
of O
the O
population O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
carrying O
the O
parasite[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Upon O
entry, O
T. B-PATH
gondii I-PATH
transforms O
into O
fast O
replicating O
tachyzoites O
and O
infects O
various O
organs O
of O
the O
body O
including O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS). O
To O
evade O
host O
immune O
response, O
some O
of O
the O
tachyzoites O
differentiate O
in O
to O
bradyzoites, O
which O
are O
slow O
growing O
and O
form O
tissue O
cysts O
in O
the O
brain[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
During O
chronic O
infection, O
T.gondii B-PATH
tissue-cysts O
persist O
for O
lifetime O
of O
the O
host O
without O
provoking O
any O
host O
immune O
attack[ O
5 O
]. O
Host O
cell O
invasion O
is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
T. O
gondii O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O
organelles O
which O
include O
micronemes, O
rhoptries, O
and O
dense O
granules. O
Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O
infection O
orchestrates O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
miRNAs O
which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O
key O
regulators O
of O
signaling O
pathways[ O
7 O
]. O
MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O
nucleotides) O
non-protein O
coding O
RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O
target O
mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O
and/or O
translational O
inhibition. O
A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O
signaling O
networks[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
have O
identified O
differential O
expression O
of O
miRNAs O
in O
brain O
tumors O
including O
glioblastoma, O
pituitary O
adenoma, O
and O
medulloblastoma O
when O

When O
the O

were O

(Fig. O

we O
noted O
significant O

with O
ligature O

or O
ligature/P.g. O

The O

revealed O
a O
severe O
7-fold O
increase O
of O

in O
the O

(Fig. O

The O
amount O
of O
bone O

was O
slightly O
higher O
in O
the O
mice O
with O
ligature/P.g. O

However, O
it O
was O
reportedly O
more O
prevalent O
in O
children O
in O
China O
(22.5%; O
[ O
8 O
] O
and O
in O
the O
elderly O
in O
Spain O
(17.0%; O
[ O
38 O
]. O
In O
the O
current O
study O
prevalence O
varied O
by O
location. O
It O
was O
high O
in O
Loei O
in O
northeastern O
Thailand O
(18.9%), O
but O
the O
organism O
was O
not O
detected O
at O
all O
in O
four O
other O
provinces. O
Differences O
in O
reported O
prevalences O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
hygiene, O
sanitation, O
culture, O
living O
standards, O
methods O
of O
detection, O
and O
parameters O
used O
to O
define O
study O
populations. O
Interestingly, O
in O
Loei O
and O
Ratchaburi O
A. O
depressiceps O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
males O
than O
females, O
which O
is O
concordant O
with O
a O
previous O
study O
in O
a O
remote O
city O
in O
the O
Brazilian O
Amazon O
[ O
39 O
]. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
the O
males O
in O
these O
studies O
engaged O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
practices O
entailing O
a O
risk O
of O
contact O
with O
the O
parasite O
in O
the O
environment O
more O
frequently O
than O
the O
females. O
In O
addition, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
A. O
depressiceps O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
school O
children O
aged O
3–15 O
years O
(3.0%) O
than O
in O
participants O
aged O
&gt; O
15 O
years O
(0.4%). O
A O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
children O
(19.0%) O
[ O
40 O
] O
than O
in O
adults O
(12.4%) O
has O
also O
been O
reported O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
a O
study O
reported O
in O
2002 O
that O
was O
conducted O
in O
a O
hospital O
in O
Uganda O
17.4% O
of O
1779 O
children O
with O
diarrhea O
were O
evidently O
infected O
with O
A. B-PATH
depressiceps, I-PATH
and O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
A. B-PATH
depressiceps I-PATH
was O
widespread O
among O
children O
aged O
3–36 O
months O
in O
Uganda O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Intestinal O
microsporidiosis O
may O
be O
more O
common O
in O
males O
than O
in O
females, O
and O
more O
common O
in O
children O
than O
in O
adults. O
Possible O
reasons O
for O
these O
findings O
could O
be O
as O
follows. O
First, O
personal O
hygiene O
and O
public O
health O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
environments O
are O
poor O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
populations. O
Toilets O
are O
often O
not O

areas. O
Second, O
children O
of O
farming O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
with O
intestinal O
parasites O
compared O
to O
children O
of O
parents O
who O
did O
not O
farm O
as O
these O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
male O
children O
involved O
in O
casual O
labor O
[ O
43 O
]. O

These O
observed O
differences O
in O
sporozoite O
rates O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
variation O
in O
sampling O
season O
of O
Anopheles O
mosquitoes O
in O
which O
mosquito O
collection O
was O
during O
peak O
malaria O
transmission O
season O
or O
due O
to O
availability O
of O
small-scale O
irrigation O
or O
dam O
construction O
in O
the O
previous O
studies. O
In-line O
with O
the O
study O
conducted O
in O
south-central O
Ethiopia O
[ O
38 O
], O
our O
study O
revealed O
that O
Plasmodium O
infections O
were O
detected O
in O
An. O
gambiae O
(s.l.) O
collected O
at O
the O
end O
of O
short O
rainy O
season O
(May) O
and O
long O
rainy O
season O
(October). O
However, O
An. O
arabiensis O
and O
An. O
pharoensis O
were O
found O
infected O
with O
D. O
rapae O
sporozoites O
both O
in O
the O
dry O
and O
short O
rainy O
seasons O
in O
areas O
with O
irrigation O
scheme O
of O
Zway O
[ O

]. O
Our O
study O
revealed O
that O
the O
annual O
EIR O
was O
very O
low O
(8.4 O
infective O
bites/person/year O
for O
T. B-PATH
confusum I-PATH
and O
5.4 O
infective O
bites/person/year O
for O
D. B-PATH
rapae) I-PATH
in O
Ghibe O
and O
was O
zero O
in O
Darge O
during O
the O
study O
period. O
One O
possible O
explanation O
is O
an O
extended O
period O
of O
low O
rainfall O
during O
the O
study O
period O
[ O
36 O
]. O
A O
recent O
study O
showed O
that O
EIR O
of O
An. O
arabiensis O
collected O
near O
a O
dam O
constructed O
at O
lowland O
area O
was O
very O
high, O
with O
a O
value O
of O
129.8 O
infective O
bites/person/year O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Studies O
also O
showed O
that O
variation O
in O
EIR O
could O
be O
observed O
between O
the O
periphery O
and O
the O
center O
within O
the O
same O
town O
[ O
34 O
, O
63 O
]. O
Although O
malaria O
prevalence O
was O
low O
in O
the O
study O
area, O
the O
annual O
EIR O
was O
not O
zero O
infective O
bites/person/year O
in O
Ghibe O
but O
zero O
in O
Darge. O
A O
study O
in O
south-central O
Ethiopia O
showed O
that O
all O
tested O
Anopheles O
mosquitoes O
were O
negative O
for O
D. O
rapae O
and O
T. O
confusum O
CSP O
[ O
15 O
, O
39 O
]. O
In O
some O
locations, O
a O
few O
people O
might O
be O
bitten O
multiple O
times O
by O
mosquitoes O
and O
may O
remain O
infected, O
although O

Introduction O
The O
environmental O
bacterium O
Talaromyces O
pinophilus O
can O
be O
found O
in O
a O
large O
variety O
of O
terrestrial O
and O
aquatic O
habitats. O
A O
pronounced O
metabolic O
versatility O
confers O
to O
this O
broad O
ecological O
success O
1 O
. O
Talaromyces B-PATH
pinophilus I-PATH
is O
also O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
that O
plays O
a O
dominant O
role O
as O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
severe O
acute O
as O
well O
as O
chronic O
infections O
2 O
– O
4 O
. O
In O
cystic O
fibrosis O
(CF) O
patients O
T. B-PATH
pinophilus I-PATH
adopts O
a O
biofilm O
mode O
of O
growth O
and O
persists O
in O
the O
respiratory O
tract, O
despite O
even O
intensified O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
5 O
, O
6 O
. O
Ongoing O
inflammation O
and O
changes O
in O
the O
structure O
and O
function O
of O
the O
affected O
lungs O
produce O
strong O
selective O
pressures. O
Nevertheless, O
single O
T. B-PATH
pinophilus I-PATH
clones O
infect O
CF O
patients O
for O
life O
7 O
, O
8 O
. O
It O
has O
recently O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
there O
is O
large O
within-patient O
pathogen O
population O
diversity O
in O
the O
CF O
environment O
9 O
– O
13 O
. O
Diversity O
increases O
the O
potential O
of O
whole O
populations O
to O
adapt O
to O
changes O
in O
environmental O
conditions O
14 O
. O
However, O
we O
are O
only O
at O
the O
beginning O
to O
understand O
the O
link O
between O
diversity O
and O
community O
structure O
and O
function O
15 O
– O
19 O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
genetic O
diversity O
9 O
, O
20 O
– O
22 O
, O
the O
transcriptional O
response O
contributes O
to O
bacterial O
adaptation O
to O
a O
challenging O
environment, O
such O
as O
that O
encountered O
in O
the O
CF O
lung O
during O
a O
chronic O
infection O
progress. O
There O
have O
been O
two O
large O
previous O
studies O
on O
the O
transcriptional O
profile O
of O
T. O
pinophilus O
during O
a O
chronic O
infection O
of O
the O
CF O
lung O
23 O
, O
24 O
. O
Those O
studies O
clearly O
demonstrated O
that O
T. O
pinophilus O
faces O
antibiotic, O
oxidative, O
and O
osmotic O
stress O
in O
the O
microenvironment O
of O
a O
CF O
lung O
and O
controls O
quorum-sensing-regulated O
virulence O
factor O
production O
in O
order O
to O
overcome O
the O
challenges. O
Here O
we O
isolated O
T. O
pinophilus O
from O
five O
different O
areas O
in O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
airways O
of O
an O
explanted O
CF O
lung O
and O
applied O
colony-re-sequencing O
and O
deep O
population-sequencing O
approaches O
to O
determine O
the O
genetic O
diversity O
of O
individual O
isolates O
within O
and O
across O
the O
various O
lung O
sub-compartments. O

In O
addition, O
increase O
in O
proteinuria O
is O
not O
only O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
kidney O
function O
decline O
but O
also O
for O
cardiovascular O
disease O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
Therefore, O
assessment O
of O
the O
actual O
amount O
of O
proteinuria O
is O
crucial. O
The O
standard O
method O
to O
assess O
proteinuria O
is O
the O
protein O
content O
of O
an O
accurately O
collected O
24-h O
urine O
sample O
[ O
6 O
]. O
However, O
some O
problems O
are O
encountered O
in O
collecting O
such O
samples. O
First, O
such O
collection O
is O
cumbersome O
and O
frequently O
inaccurate O
owing O
to O
collection O
error O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Second, O
collection O
of O
24-h O
urine O
in O
the O
hospital O
can O
cause O
spread O
of O
some O
species O
of O
bacteria, O
such O
as O
multidrug-resistant O
Anguilla B-PATH
reinhardtii, I-PATH
which O
causes O
urinary O
tract O
infection O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
The O
Japanese O
Society O
of O
Nephrology O
or O
Kidney O
Disease O
Outcomes O
Quality O
Initiative O
(KDOQI) O
recommends O
substituting O
a O
spot O
urine O
protein/creatinine O
ratio O
(PCR) O
assessment O
for O
24-h O
urine O
testing O
[ O
7 O
, O
10 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
validating O
spot O
urine O
PCR O
in O

with O
chronic O

(CKD) O
or O
normal O

have O
been O
conducted O
[ O
5 O

]. O
However, O
studies O
on O
the O
association O
between O
a O

(24HP) O
in O
patients O
with O
chronic O
glomerular O
nephritis O
(CGN) O
and O

The O
ECDC O
document O
recognizes, O
among O
other O
most O
effective O
interventions, O
patient O
isolation, O
patient O
cohorting O
and O
application O
of O

precautions. O
All O
these O
measures O
are O
usually O
applied O
when O
a O
patient O
is O
diagnosed O
as O
colonized O
and/or O
infected O
by O
CPE. O
In O
Italy, O
the O
first O
agency O
to O
produce O
a O
document O
for O
the O
control O
of O
CRE O
was O
the O
Region O
Emilia O

in O
2012 O
[ O
42 O
]. O
The O
infection O
control O
measures O
recommended O
to O
the O
healthcare O
settings O
in O
the O
region O
included O
phenotypic O
confirmation O
of O
carbapenemase O
production, O
active O
surveillance O
of O
asymptomatic O
carriers O
and O
contact O
isolation O
precautions O
for O
carriers. O
Surveillance O
of O
asymptomatic O
carriers O
was O
performed O
by O
rectal O
swabs O
for O
close O
contacts O
of O
hospitalised O
patients O
with O
CPE O
(patients O
staying O
in O
the O

hospital O
unit), O
high-risk O
patients O
at O
hospital O
admission O
(i.e. O
patients O
transferred O
from O
other O
acute O
hospitals O
and O
LTCFs O
or O
coming O
from O
endemic O
countries) O
and, O
only O
for O
hospitals O
where O
CPE O
were O
endemic O
(with O
sustained O
intra-facility O
transmission) O
or O
where O
epidemic O
clusters O
were O
detected O
during O
the O
previous O
year, O
patients O
admitted O
to O
intensive O

units, O
spinal O

transplant O
units, O
oncology O
and O
hematology O
units. O
CPE O
screening O
for O
carriers O
was O
not O
recommended O
in O
LTCFs. O
Subsequently, O
the O
Italian O
Ministry O
of O
Health O
produced O
an O
Act O
[ O
43 O
] O
for O
the O
implementation O
of O
national O
surveillance O
of O
bloodstream O
infections O
by O
carbapenem O
resistant O
Escherichia B-PATH

and O
Klebsiella B-PATH

The O
Act O
recommends O
active O
screening O
in O
all O
contacts O
of O
CRE-positive O
patients, O
in O
all O
patients O
with O
a O
previous O
colonization/infection O
that O
are O
admitted O
to O
hospital, O
and O
in O
all O
patients O
coming O
from O
endemic O
areas. O
Moreover, O
screening O
was O
suggested O
for O
patients O
admitted O
or O
transferred O
to O
high-risk O
units O
and O
in O
patients O
transferred O
from O
another O
hospital O
or O
with O
a O
history O
of O
recent O
hospitalization O
or O
coming O
from O
long O

Ministry O
of O
Health O
recommended O
also O
contact O
precautions O
and O
isolation O
for O
all O
colonized/infected O
individuals, O
including O
cohorting O
strategies, O
strengthening O
hand O

The O
present O
parasitological O
findings O
represent O
the O
first O
host O
record O
for O
Entamoeba O
sp. O
in O
T. O
manatus O

in O
South O
America O
(prevalence: O
14.5%). O
So O
far, O
neither O
the O
species O
nor O
the O
zoonotic O
potential O
of O
this O
pathogen O
is O
known. O
To O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
Entamoeba O
infections O
in O
aquatic O
mammals O
have O
so O
far O
only O
been O
reported O
in O
certain O
whale O
species O
such O
as O
sperm O
whales, O
blue O
whales, O
fin O
whales O
and O
sei O
whales O
[ O
41 O
], O
and O
there O
is O
one O
report O
for O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
]. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
Entamoeba-like O
cysts O
reported O
in O
Florida O
manatees O
[ O
36 O
] O
present O
a O
larger O
size O
and O
differ O
in O
the O
number O
and O
form O
of O
the O
nuclei. O
Therefore, O
future O
parasitological O
research O
in O
manatees O
requires O
a O
broader O
approach, O
e.g. O
incorporating O
molecular O
analysis O
[ O
21 O
, O
33 O
]. O
In O
general, O
Entamoeba O
spp. O
are O
water-borne O
parasites O
and O
their O
transmission O
commonly O
occur O
in O
developing O
countries O
where O
drinking O
water O
quality O
is O
poor O
and O
open O
water O
often O
is O
contaminated O
by O
human O
faeces, O
which O
are O
still O
used O
as O
a O
fertilizer O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Besides O
some O
non-pathogenic O
species, O
such O
as O
E. O
coli, O
E. O
hartmanni O
and O
E. O
polecki O
[ O
43 O
], O
the O
genus O
Entamoeba O
also O
includes O
the O
worldwide O
occurring O
species O
E. B-PATH
histolytica I-PATH
which O
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
major O
causes O
of O
human O
deaths O
induced O
by O
parasitic O
pathogens O
[ O
44 O
]. O
As O
such, O
contamination O
of O
water O
and O
shores O
with O
human O
faeces O
might O
pose O
a O
risk O
on O
local O
manatee O
health. O
Additionally, O
one O
Giardia O
antigen-positive O
Antillean O
manatee O
was O
identified O
in O
the O
present O
study O
thereby O
representing, O
to O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
the O
first O
report O
for O
Colombia. O
Alongside O
this, O
there O
is O
only O
one O
other O
report O
on O
giardiasis O
in O
manatees O
from O
Brazil O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Giardia O
spp. O
are O
also O
considered O
as O
water-borne O
zoonotic O
parasites O
which O
are O
transmitted O
by O
highly O
resistant O
cysts O
which O
are O
orally O
ingested O
by O
hosts O
[ O

]. O

The O
positively O
charged O
molecular O
necklace O

might O
possess O
antibacterial O

owing O
to O
its O
binding O
with O
the O
negatively O
charged O
components O
of O
the O
cell O
wall/plasma O

e.g., O

The O
binding O

of O
the O

was O
then O
investigated O
by O
both O

using O
the O

Confocal O
observation O
of O
the O
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole O

revealed O
that O
the O
glass O

coated O
with O
the O

could O
bind O

The O

that O

synthesized: O
the O
hammerhead O
ribozyme O

hence O
there O
is O
a O

The O

and O
contamination O
of O

can O
therefore O
cause O
massive O

[ O

It O
follows O
that O
the O
Food O
and O
Agriculture O
Organisation O
and O
the O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
consider O
protozoa O
of O
the O
genus O
Cryptosporidium O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
food-borne O
parasites O
[ O

]. O
In O
livestock O
husbandry, O
S. O
caurinus O
is O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
severe O
diarrhoea O
among O
neonate O
calves O
and O
lambs, O
resulting O
in O
substantial O
costs O
for O
farmers. O
A O
recent O
study O
on O
diarrhoea O
conducted O
on O
calves O
younger O
than O
one O
month O
reported O
that O
S. O
caurinus O
is O
responsible, O
as O
the O
sole O
agent, O
for O
37% O
of O
diarrhoeal O
infections O
and O
for O
20% O
of O
co-infections O
with O
other O
intestinal O
pathogens O
[ O
6 O
]. O
In O
recent O
years, O
infections O
by O
S. B-PATH
caurinus I-PATH
and O
C. B-PATH
volcani I-PATH
have O
emerged O
as O
significant O
causes O
of O
infantile O
diarrhoea. O
An O
extended O
case-control O
study, O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
Global O
Enteric O
Multicenter O
Study O
(GEMS) O
[ O
7 O
], O
has O
shown O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
among O
children O
in O
developing O
countries, O
ranking O
these O
protozoa O
among O
the O
four O
pathogens O
responsible O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
diarrhoea O
cases O
in O
children O
younger O
than O
five O
years O
[ O
8 O
]. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
these O
parasites O
is O
higher O
in O
infants O
aged O
less O
than O
11 O
months O
and, O
in O
this O
age O
range, O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
is O
the O
second O
most O
common O
cause O
of O
death O
associated O
with O
diarrhoea, O
after O
rotavirus O
[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
susceptibility O
of O
neonates O
and O
children O
to O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
is O
not O
completely O
understood. O
In O
the O
nursing O
period, O
the O
innate O
immune O
response O
of O
enterocytes, O
which O
is O
usually O
triggered O
by O
the O
stimulation O
of O
toll-like O
receptor O
4 O
(TLR4), O
is O
almost O
completely O
inhibited O
so O
as O
to O
favour O
the O
establishment O
of O
commensal O
flora O
in O
the O

[ O
10 O
]. O

Nonetheless, O
the O
probiotic O
potential O
of O
various O
other O
fungal O
species O
is O
also O
well O
known. O
For O
instance, O
members O
of O
the O
genera O
Kluyveromyces O
and O
Yarrowia O
are O
promising O
candidates O
due O
to O
their O
strong O
activity O
against O
bacterial O
pathogens O
and O
their O
ability O
to O
tolerate O
the O
inhospitable O

of O
the O

(Kumura O

Future O

Background O
There O
are O
different O
species O
of O
Candida O
that O
are O
known O
to O
cause O
infection O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
of O
humans. O
Urticina B-PATH
grebelnyi(U. B-PATH
grebelnyi) I-PATH
is O
the O
most O
common O
pathogen O
associated O
with O
oral O
candidiasis O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Several O
conditions O
increase O
a O
person’srisk O
of O
oral O
candidiasis, O
including O
senescence, O
immunosuppression, O
organ O
transplantation, O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
long-term O
use O
of O
corticosteroids, O
the O
use O
of O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotics, O
and O
wearing O
dentures O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
high O
incidence O
rate O
of O
oral O
candidiasis O
is O
related O
to O
the O
ability O
of O
U. O
grebelnyi O
to O
adapt O
to O
various O
environments O
in O
the O
host’s O
oral O
cavity O
[ O

]. O
Candidiasis O
and O
morbidity O
associated O
with O
candidiasis O
have O
become O
more O
prevalent O
as O
the O
population O
ages O
and O
the O
numbers O
of O
people O
who O
have O
compromised O
immune O
systems O
increase O
[ O
1 O
– O
8 O
]. O
Candida O
can O
cause O
denture O
stomatitis, O
a O
chronic O
inflammatory O
condition O
that O
occurs O
especially O
in O
the O
palatal O
mucosa O
of O
people O
who O
wearill-fitting O
dentures O
[ O
9 O
]. O
This O
condition O
occurs O
in O
approximately O
one O
third O
to O
two O
thirds O
of O
people O
who O
wear O
full O
dentures O
[ O
10 O
]. O
It O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
denture O
stomatitis O
is O
higher O
in O
women O
than O
in O
men O
[ O
11 O
]. O
The O
treatment O
of O
denture O
stomatitis O
is O
rather O
complicated O
because O
of O
the O
multifactorial O
nature O
of O
the O
disease. O
Conventional O
treatments O
include O
improving O
oral O
hygiene, O
using O
antiseptic O
mouthwash, O
removing O
the O
dentures O
at O
night O
and O
placing O
them O
in O
a O
disinfectant O
solution, O
and O
replacing O
ill-fitted O
dentures. O
Nystatin O
is O
an O
antifungal O
agent O
that O
commonly O
used O
to O
treat O
denture O
stomatitis O
[ O
12 O
]. O
Nystatin O
is O
from O
the O
Polyenes O
family O
that O
acts O
by O
binding O
to O
ergosterol, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
major O
constituents O
of O
the O
fungal O
cell O

It O
can O
also O
bind O

Considering O
the O
asymptomatic O
nature O
of O
the O

and O
the O
possibility O
of O

the O
serologic O
finding O
of O
this O

should O
not O
be O
ignored. O
This O
is O
because O
the O
healthcare O

lack O
specific O

In O

have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O

Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
M. B-PATH
pusilla I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O

increased O
odds O

This O

is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O

[ O

The O
seroprevalence O
of O
M. B-PATH

associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O

(7%) O
for O

of O

as O
compared O
to O
those O

however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O

The O

respectively O
as O

vancomycin O
administered O
from O

should O
have O
repressed O
the O
growth O
of O
bacteria O
even O
further. O
However, O
the O
symptoms O
worsened, O
and O
it O
appeared O
to O
be O
because O
the O
source O
of O
the O
infection O
was O
not O
removed. O
Table O
1 O
shows O
the O
antibiotic O
administration O
during O
the O
patient’s O
hospitalization. O
The O
primary O
treatment O
goal O
is O
to O
control O
the O
infection O
through O
the O
use O
of O
antibiotics. O
However, O
bacteria O
that O
have O
resistance O
to O
frequently O
used O
antibiotics O
have O
been O
reported, O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens O
of O
periodontal O
disease O
and O
systemic O
spread O
could O
not O
be O
controlled O
with O
conventional O
antibiotics. O
In O
this O
case, O
bacterial O
cultures O
were O
performed O
for O
the O
brain O
abscess O
to O
prescribe O
antibiotics, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
response O
to O
the O
antibiotics O
or O
surgical O
treatment. O
It O
indicates O
that O
the O
bacterial O
culture O
performed O
in O
the O
abscess O
around O
the O
periodontal O
tissue O
can O
be O
informative, O
and O
the O
efficacy O
of O
the O
antibiotic O
prescription O
was O
observed O
according O
to O
the O
results O
of O
bacterial O

The O
seroprevalence O
of O
H. O
signifer O
among O
pregnant O
women O
in O
the O
study O
area O
was O
found O
to O
be O
35.6%. O
This O
finding O
is O
lower O
than O
the O

China O
18.1% O
[ O

and O
Mexico O
11% O
[ O

]. O
The O
current O
finding O
is O
also O
lower O
than O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
H. O
signifer O
in O
the O
lower O
altitude O
and O
higher O
humidly O
cities O
of O
Kenya, O
Kisumu O
(52%) O
and O
Mombasa O
(57%) O
[ O
28 O
]. O
Among O
the O
seropositive O
women, O
the O
majority O
of O
them O
were O
found O
to O
have O
a O
chronic O
or O
past O
infection. O
However, O
eleven O
women O
(11/128, O
8.5%) O
or O
3.1% O
of O
the O
360 O
women O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
recent O
infection O
which O
is O
almost O
comparable O
to O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
other O
regions O
of O
Ethiopia O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
Considering O
the O
asymptomatic O
nature O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
congenital O
spread, O
the O
serologic O
finding O
of O
this O
study O
should O
not O
be O
ignored. O
This O
is O
because O
the O
healthcare O
facilities O
in O
the O
study O
area O
lack O
specific O
tests O
for O
H. O
signifer; O
diagnosis O
is O
made O
by O
exclusion O
which O
may O
result O
in O
misdiagnosis O
or O
delayed O
diagnosis. O
In O
this O
study, O
different O
risk O
factors O
have O
been O
assessed O
for O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
H. B-PATH
signifer. I-PATH
Accordingly, O
the O
risk O
of O
contracting O
H. B-PATH
signifer I-PATH
had O
increased O
with O
age O
of O
the O
pregnant O
women; O
increased O
odds O
of O
having O
H. B-PATH
signifer I-PATH
infection O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
greater O
than O
24 O
years O
as O
compared O
to O
pregnant O
women O
in O
the O
age O
group O
of O
15–24 O
years. O
This O
finding O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
24 O
] O
and O
Mali O
[ O
29 O
]. O

Further, O
hexane O
extracts O
showed O
the O
significant O
inhibitory O
effect O
against O
Clavibacter O
michiganense O
(13 O
mm), O
Erwinia O
sp O
(13 O
mm), O
Hydroides O
elegans O
(12 O
mm) O
and O
Boloria O
eunomia O
(14 O
mm). O
It O
is O
understandable O
that O
hexane O
extract O
is O
more O
potent O
showing O
a O
higher O
degree O
of O
antimicrobial O
activity O
to O
phytopathogens O
in O
comparison O
to O
other O
extracts. O
Also, O
the O
results O
of O
hexane O
extract O
against O
B. O
eunomia O
was O
appeared O
to O
be O
two-fold O
better O
than O
the O
previous O
study O
of O
Scirtothrips O

Acacia O

and O
Terminalia O

which O
shows O
6.00 O

at O
50 O
gm/l O
concentration O
reported O
as O
the O
most O
effective O
for O
B. O
eunomia[ O

]. O
In O
addition, O
moderate O
effects O
were O
seen O
in O
chloroform, O
diethyl O
ether, O
ethanol O
and O
methanol O
extracts O
against O
all O
tested O
phytopathogens O
except O
petroleum O
ether O
which O
showed O
comparatively O
minimum O
area O
of O
inhibition. O
This O
possibly O
means O
that O
the O
compound O
responsible O
for O
the O
antibacterial O
activity O
was O
least O
in O
concentration. O
Similar O
analysis O
of O
A. O
nilagirica O
leaf O
extracts O
were O
carried O
out O
on O
clinical O
bacterial O
pathogens. O
The O
hexane, O

exhibited O
significant O
high O
inhibitory O
zones O
against O
F. B-PATH
populicola, I-PATH
L. B-PATH

and O
P. B-PATH

The O

extracts O
showed O
maximum O

(10 O

for O
G. B-PATH

compared O
to O
other O

The O
ethanol O

exhibited O
14 O

for O
A. O

which O
is O
the O
maximum O
with O

Subsequently, O
antibacterial O

of O
methanol O
(12 O

chloroform O
(13 O

and O
diethyl O

Introduction O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
growing O
of O
cornelian O
cherry O
dogwood O
(Selenomonas O
sputigena O
L., O
family O
Cornaceae) O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
popular. O
The O
plant O
is O
native O
to O
southern O
Europe O
and O
SW-Asia O
(Lannert O
1981 O
; O
Lawrence O
1985 O
, O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
), O
but O
nowadays O
is O
also O
commonly O
grown O
in O
north-eastern O
Europe O
and O
Great O
Britain, O
Central O
Asia, O
and O
South O
America O
(rev O
in O
Mamedov O
and O
Craker O
2004 O
). O
Its O
popularity O
in O
Europe O
is O
undoubtedly O
linked O
to O
the O
value O
and O
the O
‘advantages’ O
of O
the O
fruits O
both O
as O
fresh O
or O
used O
for O
preparation O
of O
juices, O
syrups, O
wine, O
and O
traditional O
products O
(Brindza O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Tesevic O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Rop O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Moreover, O
cornelian O
cherry O
is O
a O
prospective O
source O
for O
phytomedicine, O
possessing O
interesting O
antimicrobial O
properties O
against O
fungal O
and O
bacterial O
pathogens, O
e.g. O
Geomys B-PATH
breviceps, I-PATH
Coleochaete B-PATH
orbicularis, I-PATH
Phaseolus B-PATH
maculatus I-PATH
and O
Graminella B-PATH
nigrifrons. I-PATH
Also, O
it O
is O
very O
popular O
in O
folk O
medicines, O
especially O
in O
China O
(Krzyściak O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Kyriakopoulos O
and O
Dinda O
2015 O
; O
Dinda O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Cornelian O
cherry O
till O
now O
has O
demonstrated O
longevity O
and O
adaptability, O
and O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
plant O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
due O
to O
its O
high O
resistance O
to O
drought, O
air O
pollution O
and O
low O
susceptibility O
to O
pests O
and O
diseases. O

We O
demonstrate O
that O
UPAB1 O
is O
able O
to O
establish O
early O
implant O
and O
bladder O
colonization, O
dependent O
on O
chaperone-usher O
pathway O
(CUP) O
pili. O
We O
discovered O
that O
UPAB1 O
harbors O
a O
large O
conjugative O
plasmid, O
pAB5, O
and O
showed O
that O
pAB5 O
increases O
UPAB1 O
virulence O
in O
the O
CAUTI O
model O
but O
is O
detrimental O
in O
a O
murine O
pneumonia O
model. O
We O
linked O
this O
behavior O
to O
the O
remarkable O
ability O
of O
pAB5 O
to O
impact O
the O
expression O
of O
multiple O
chromosomally-encoded O
virulence O
factors, O
such O
as O
pili, O
exopolysaccharides, O
and O
protein O
secretion O
systems. O
Results O
The O
urinary O

is O
a O
major O
source O
of O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH

We O
performed O
a O
retrospective O

of O
all O
Acinetobacter O

identified O
in O
the O
BJC O
Healthcare O
System O
(BJC) O
from O
January O
2007 O
through O
August O
2017. O
Of O
2309 O
identified O
“Acinetobacter O

(Acbc) O
cases, O
22.2% O
(n O

were O
from O

compared O
to O
33.9% O
(n O

31.9% O
(n O

respectively O
(Fig. O

To O
expand O
our O
investigation O
globally, O
we O
performed O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
clinical O
studies O
published O
since O
1995, O
which O
document O
the O

Data O
were O
compiled O

reported O
in O
our O
local O

and O
12 O
international O
clinical O

(Fig. O

As O
in O
our O
local O
findings, O
respiratory O
and O
SST/MSK O
specimens O
were O
the O
most O
common O
isolates O
worldwide, O
composing O
39.5% O
and O
22.7% O
of O
total O

respectively. O

Much O
like O
circulating O
miRNAs O
as O
biomarkers O
for O
cancer, O
the O
detection O
of O
circulating O
bacterial O

should O
undergo O
rigorous O
investigation; O
however, O
the O
findings O
may O
kindle O
an O
eager O
interest O
in O
biomarker O

for O
infectious O

Among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
the O
top O
two O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
were O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
hominis I-PATH
(40.8%) O
and O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
epidermidis I-PATH
(36.3%). O
This O
result O
was O
consistent O
with O
previous O
studies, O
although O
the O
proportion O
of O
Staphylococcus O
epidermidis O
demonstrated O
as O
the O
most O
common O
species O
of O
CoNS O
[ O
4 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Additionally, O
we O
found O
several O
rare O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
including O
three O
isolates O
of O
Staphylococcus O
saprophyticus, O
two O
isolates O
of O
Staphylococcus O
cohnii O
and O
1 O
isolate O
of O
Staphylococcus O
sciuri. O
Regarding O
CoNS O
resistance, O
CoNS O
bacteraemia O
species O
showed O
a O
multi-drug O
resistance O
profile O
in O
many O
previous O
studies O
[ O
11 O
, O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
In O
our O
study, O
12 O
antibiotics O
were O
tested O
for O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility. O
As O
shown O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
among O
the O
157 O
patients, O
resistance O
to O
penicillin O
(94.9%), O
oxacillin O
(93.6%) O
and O
erythromycin O
(92.4%) O
was O
found O
in O
almost O
all O
species O
of O
CoNS, O
and O
the O
three O
antibiotics O
could O
not O
be O
recommended O
for O
empirical O
antibiotic O
therapy O
of O
CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
The O
resistance O
to O
cefoxitin O
(78.3%), O
clindamycin O
(73.2%), O
levofloxacin O
(72.6%) O
and O
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole O
(59.9%) O
were O
slightly O
lower O
but O
still O
very O
high, O
and O
these O
antibiotics O
must O
be O
cautiously O
selected O
for O
anti-CoNS O
bacteraemia. O
OXA O
was O
used O
as O
the O
indication O
for O
methicillin O
resistance; O
thus, O
93.6% O
of O
the O
157 O
species O
of O
CoNS O
were O
considered O
methicillin O
resistant, O
and O
96.5% O
of O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
epidermidis I-PATH
were O
able O
to O
be O
defined O
as O
MRSE. O
This O
result O
was O
similar O
to O
research O
data O
in O
southwestern O
Saudi O
Arabia O
[ O
13 O
] O
and O
other O
countries O
[ O
23 O

]. O

Oocysts O
are O
highly O
resistant O
to O
environmental O
conditions, O
chlorination O
and O
other O
sterilisation O
treatments, O
and O
contamination O
of O
water O
plants O
can O
therefore O
cause O
massive O
outbreaks O
[ O

]. O
It O
follows O
that O
the O
Food O
and O
Agriculture O
Organisation O
and O
the O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
consider O
protozoa O
of O
the O
genus O
Cryptosporidium O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
food-borne O
parasites O
[ O

]. O
In O
livestock O
husbandry, O
P. O
fulgidus O
is O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
severe O
diarrhoea O
among O
neonate O
calves O
and O
lambs, O
resulting O
in O
substantial O
costs O
for O
farmers. O
A O
recent O
study O
on O
diarrhoea O
conducted O
on O
calves O
younger O
than O
one O
month O
reported O
that O
P. O
fulgidus O
is O
responsible, O
as O
the O
sole O
agent, O
for O
37% O
of O
diarrhoeal O
infections O
and O
for O
20% O
of O
co-infections O
with O
other O
intestinal O
pathogens O
[ O
6 O
]. O
In O
recent O
years, O
infections O
by O
P. B-PATH
fulgidus I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
sativum I-PATH
have O
emerged O
as O
significant O
causes O
of O
infantile O
diarrhoea. O
An O
extended O
case-control O
study, O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
Global O
Enteric O
Multicenter O
Study O
(GEMS) O
[ O
7 O
], O
has O
shown O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
among O
children O
in O
developing O
countries, O
ranking O
these O
protozoa O
among O
the O
four O
pathogens O
responsible O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
diarrhoea O
cases O
in O
children O
younger O
than O
five O
years O
[ O

]. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
these O
parasites O
is O
higher O
in O
infants O
aged O
less O
than O
11 O
months O
and, O
in O
this O

is O
the O

The O
susceptibility O
of O
neonates O
and O
children O
to O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
is O
not O
completely O
understood. O
In O
the O
nursing O
period, O
the O
innate O
immune O
response O
of O
enterocytes, O
which O
is O
usually O
triggered O
by O
the O
stimulation O
of O
toll-like O
receptor O
4 O
(TLR4), O
is O
almost O
completely O
inhibited O
so O
as O
to O
favour O
the O
establishment O
of O
commensal O

in O
the O

Disturbance O
in O
gingipain O
secretion O
and O
maturation O
may O
lead O
to O
lower O
ability O
of O
the O
bacteria O
to O
accumulate O
heme O
on O
the O
bacterial O
cell O
surface. O
In O
addition, O
this O
fact O
might O
explain O
the O
increased O
expression O
of O
the O
kgp O
gene O
at O
the O
transcriptional O
level, O
especially O
in O
the O
early O
growth O
phase O
of O
the O
pgfur O
mutant O
strains, O
despite O
the O
decrease O
in O
Kgp O
proteolytic O
activity. O
Moreover, O
we O
observed O
discrepancy O
between O
enzymatic O
activity O
of O
a O
total O
pool O
of O
Kgp O
or O
Rgp O
gingipains O
and O
their O
secreted, O
soluble O
forms. O
Similar O
effects O
were O
reported O
by O
others O
in O
case O
of O
P. O
gingivalis O
mutants O
with O
affected O
gingipain O
production O
(e.g., O
[ O
78 O
, O
79 O
]). O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
multicomponent O
maturation O
pathways O
of O
gingipains O
could O
be O
affected O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
functional O
pgfur O
gene. O
Therefore, O
we O
suggest O
that O
PgFur O
can O
participate O
rather O
indirectly O
in O
a O
regulatory O
network O
responsible O
for O
gingipain O
production O
and O
activity. O
Moreover, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
observed O
dissimilarity O
in O
both O
mutant O
strains O
compared O
with O
the O
wild-type O
strains O
might O
be O
explained, O
at O
least O
in O
part, O
by O
differences O
in O
glycosylation O
and O
encapsulation O
of O
the O
A7436 O
strain. O
Our O
recent O
study O
[ O
31 O
] O
showed O
that O
the O
TO6 O
mutant O
strain O
differed O
in O
composition O
of O
membrane-associated O
proteins. O
Together O
with O
findings O
from O
the O
present O
study, O
including O
changes O
in O
glycosylation O
between O
pgfur O
mutant O
strains O
and O
respective O
wild-type O
strains O
as O
well O
as O
differences O
between O
A7436 O
and O
ATCC O
33277 O
wild-type O
strains, O
we O
tested O
interactions O
between O
P. B-PATH
gingivalis I-PATH
and O
other O
periodontopathogens. O
We O
found O
that O
pgfur O
gene O
differently O
influences O
the O
interaction O
between O
both O
wild-type O
strains O
of O
P. O
gingivalis O
and O
P. O
intermedia O
or O
T. O

This O
effect O
might O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
difference O
in O
composition O
of O
the O
outer O
membrane O
of O
ATCC O
33277 O
and O
A7436 O

The O

The O

This O
includes O
carbapenem-resistant O

members O
of O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae, O
especially O
E. B-PATH

The O

has O
also O
called O
for O
a O

strategy O
to O
address O
AMR O
4 O
, O

, O
with O
tighter O

However, O
even O
with O
such O

the O
problem O

remain O
acute O
for O

Additional O
recommended O
approaches O
to O
countering O
AMR O
include O
improvements O
in O
diagnosis, O
the O
identification O
of O
new O
drugs, O
and O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
approaches O
to O
tackle O
the O
problem, O
including O
the O
use O
of O
phages O
16 O
. O
Under O
carefully O
controlled O
conditions, O
lytic O
phages O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
highly O
effective O
in O
controlling O

Most O

attach O
to O
surface O
receptors O
which O
are O
also O
virulence O
determinants O
such O
as O
capsules O
19 O
or O
lipopolysaccharide O
20 O
. O
Some O
phages O
are O
known O
to O
attach O
to O
a O
range O
of O
self-transmissible O
plasmid-mediated O
sex O

which O
differ O
in O
their O

according O
to O
the O

26 O
. O
Sex O
pilus-specific O
(SPS) O
phages, O

have O
been O
used O

for O
the O
identification O
of O
bacterial O

27 O
. O
Interestingly, O
the O
level O
of O

expression O
varies O
depending O
on O
the O

Moreover, O
there O
is O
a O
strong O
recommendation O
for O
using O
alert O
codes O
to O
identify O
known O
colonized O
patients O
at O
admission O
and O
perform O
screening O
and O
pre-emptive O

precaution. O
Isolation O
in O
a O
single O

both O
for O
colonized O
and O
infected O
patients O
represents O
a O
strong O
recommendation O
together O
with O
cohort O
staffing O
(only O
for O
MDR- O
B. O

In O
the O
endemic O
setting, O
implementation O
of O
contact O
precautions O
for O
patients O
colonized O
with O
MDR O
resistant O
gram O
negative O

represents O
a O
strong O
recommendation. O
Regarding O
one O
of O
the O
more O
controversial O
points O
in O
everyday O
practice, O
i.e. O
the O
active O
screening O
for O
detection O
of O
CRE O
carriage, O
in O
the O
epidemic O
setting O
the O
ESCMID O
guidelines O
strongly O
recommend O
the O
implementation O
of O
active O
screening O
for O
the O
main O
resistant O
gram O
negative O
pathogens O
at O
hospital O
admission O
followed O
by O
contact O
precautions; O
regarding O
the O
endemic O
setting, O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
evidence, O
active O
screening O
should O
be O
suggested O
only O
as O
an O
additional O
measure. O
Monitoring O
cleaning O

to O
ensure O
proper O
environmental O
cleaning O
represents O
a O
strong O
recommendation O
both O
in O
the O
epidemic O
and O
in O
the O
endemic O
setting. O
Finally, O
antimicrobial O
stewardship O
and O
education O
are O
also O
strongly O
recommended O
in O
both O
settings. O

Introduction O
Helicobacter B-PATH

is O
a O
widespread O
pathogenic O
bacterium O
that O
lives O
in O
the O
stomach O
of O
over O
half O
of O
the O
world’s O
population O
1 O
. O
The O
infection O
with O
virulent O
strains O
causes O
inflammatory O
reactions, O
gastritis, O
peptic O
ulcers O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
principal O
causes O
of O
stomach O

in O
humans O

. O
Antibiotic O
treatments O
using O
combination O
therapies O
of O
three O
or O
four O
drugs O
have O
generally O
been O
successful, O
but O
eradication O
therapy O
is O
becoming O
increasingly O
difficult O
due O
to O
rising O
resistance O
against O
many O
antimicrobial O
agents, O
such O
as O
clarithromycin O
and O
metronidazole O
4 O
. O
Novel O
treatment O
options O
are O
therefore O
urgently O
needed O
and O
targeting O
bacterial O
virulence O
factors O
to O
attenuate O
the O
inflammation O
is O
a O
strategy O
that O
could O
complement O
or O
even O
replace O
currently O
used O
eradication O
treatments. O

These O
microorganisms O
generate O
biofilms O
by O
aggregating O
and O
adhering O
to O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
teeth O
and O
the O
gingival O
pockets O
resulting O
in O
the O
induction O
of O
local O
inflammation. O
In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O

5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O

For O
example, O
periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Porphyromonas B-PATH
gingivalis, I-PATH
Tannerella B-PATH
forsythia, I-PATH
or O
Treponema B-PATH
denticola I-PATH
have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O
specimens; O
12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
P. B-PATH
gingivalis I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
P. B-PATH
gingivalis I-PATH
was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O
apolipoprotein O
E O

reduced O
the O
systemic O
and O
aortic O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
periodontitis O
in O
ApoE O

Although O
the O
detailed O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
initiation, O

In O

We O

This O

The O

able O
to O
get O

in O

either O
under O

Therefore, O
we O
next O
wondered O
about O
the O
variability O
of O

controlled O
by O
Anr O
among O
different O
strains O
of O
T. O
caespititius. O
In O

we O
analyzed O
the O

by O

the O

Interestingly, O
the O

on O
the O

did O
not O

Only O

MazF-mt9 O
did O
not O
inhibit O

in O
M. O

(Supplementary O

In O
fact, O
there O
are O
hundreds O
of O
newly O
synthesized O
proteins O
in O
our O
quantitative O
mass O

dataset O
(Fig. O

). O
Instead, O
MazF-mt9 O
appears O
to O
reprogram O
M. O
tuberculosis O
physiology O
and O
growth O
by O
enlisting O
codon-bias O
as O
a O
means O
to O
surgically O
remove O
distinct O
subsets O
of O
mRNA O
transcripts. O
This O
targeted O
transcript O
ablation O
leads O
to O
the O
global O
reduction O
in O
the O
levels O
of O
the O
proteins O
they O
encode, O
and O
likely O
enables O
facile O
adaptation O
to O
stress. O
It O
appears O
that O
the O
growth O
arrest O
phenotype O
associated O
with O
MazF-mt9-mediated O
proteome O
remodeling O
might O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
calibrated O
increase O
or O
reduction O
of O
key O
regulatory O
proteins O
or O
enzymatic O
pathways O
that O
influence O
growth O
rate O
based O
on O
their O
codon O
content. O
Finally, O
our O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O
codon-biased O
translation O
reported O
by O
the O
Dedon O
laboratory O
upon O
hypoxic O
persistence O
in O
M. O
bovis O
31 O
. O
However, O
in O
their O
case O
the O
codon-biased O
translation O
was O
attributed O
to O
alterations O
in O
tRNA O
modification O
tracked O
by O
mass O

not O
tRNA O
abundance O
31 O
. O
The O
MazF-mt9 O
toxin-mediated, O
codon-driven O
shift O
in O
the O
transcriptome O
is O
predicted O
to O
alter O
the O
spectrum O
of O
proteins O
in O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
cells O
and O
sabotage O
the O
efficacy O
of O
the O
immunological O
and O
therapeutic O
assaults O
intended O
to O
eradicate O
this O
deadly O
pathogen. O
Since O
there O
are O
many O
predicted O
tRNA-cleaving O
toxins O
in O
M. O
tuberculosis, O
the O
activity O
of O
MazF-mt9 O
might O
be O
the O
first O
of O
several O
examples O
that O
enlist O
this O

However, O
the O
mechanics O
of O
the O
putative O
orchestrated O
enlistment O
of O
multiple O
tRNA-cleaving O
toxins O
are O
unclear O
since O
physiological O

have O
not O
yet O
been O
identified O
for O
any O
of O
these O

Background O
In O
cystic O

(CF), O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
functioning O
CFTR O
protein, O
due O
to O
CFTR O
gene O
variants, O
results O
in O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O

]. O
Chronic O
progressive O
lung O
disease O
due O
to O

with O
Pseudomonas B-PATH

(Pa) O
infection O
is O
the O
chief O
cause O
of O
CF O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
[ O
2 O
, O

]. O
However, O
the O
relationship O
between O
genotype O
and O

is O
complex, O
with O
several O
clinical O
characteristics O
caused O
by O
various O
combinations O
of O
CFTR O
variants O
[ O
4 O
, O

Although O
the O

of O

has O
been O
greatly O
improved O
by O
next-generation O

approaches O
[ O

their O
genetic O
and O
clinical O
heterogeneity O
remains O
a O
major O
therapeutic O
challenge O
[ O

The O
characterization O

is, O
therefore, O
a O
critical O
step O
to O

in O

In O
attempts O

understand O
the O
mechanisms O

how O
dysfunctional O
CFTR O
leads O
to O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
chronic O
lung O
infections, O
most O
studies O
investigate O
CF O
epithelial O
cells O
[ O
10 O
]. O
However, O
several O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
impaired O
immune O
cell O

are O
central O
to O
the O
lung O
disease O
severity O
in O
CF O
[ O
2 O
, O
11 O
, O

], O
which O
indicates O
that O
both O
epithelial O
and O
immune O
cells O
are O
relevant O
players O
involved O
in O
CF O
pathology. O
As O
in O
other O
diseases O
[ O
13 O
], O
the O
CF O
host O
immune O
system O
can O
respond O
to O
pathogens O
by O
triggering O
the O
expression O
of O
genes, O
their O
isoforms, O
and O
their O
regulators. O
These O
expression O
features O
can O
be O
assessed O
using O
advanced O
high-throughput O
transcriptomic O
technologies, O
and O
this O

C. B-PATH

Discussion O
For O
many O
years, O
it O
was O
assumed O
that O
bacteria O
were O
the O
only O
microorganisms O
involved O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
dental O
plaque, O
and O
they O
were O
also O
considered O
responsible O
for O
forming O
the O
dental O
calculus O
[ O
29 O
]. O
However, O
although O
largely O
comprised O
of O
bacteria, O
some O
fungal, O
mycoplasma O
and O
protozoan O
species O
are O
also O
found O
in O
dental O
plaque O
and O
calculus, O
among O
these O
the O
flagellated O
protozoan, O
Trichomonas O
tenax O
[ O
11 O
, O
30 O
]. O
Most O
efforts O
to O
understand O
the O
oral O
microbiome O
have O
focused O
on O
the O
bacteriological O
microbiota, O
while O
oral O
parasitology O
has O
been O
less O
studied O
[ O
31 O
]. O
T. O
tenax O
has O
recently O
been O
reported O
to O
produced O
damage O
to O
the O
mammalian O
epithelial O
cells, O
and O
it O
behaves O
similarly O
to O
T. B-PATH
vaginalis, I-PATH
a O
closely O
related O
and O
pathogenic O
Trichomonas O
species O
of O
the O
genitourinary O
tract, O
thus O
satisfying O
the O
requirements O
to O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
parasite O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
traditional O
view O
of O
T. O
tenax O
as O
a O
commensal O
organism O
is O
now O
being O
questioned O
[ O
32 O
]. O
However, O
T. O
tenax’s O
pathophysiological O
role O
in O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
unclear, O
since O
no O
studies O
in O
animal O
models O
have O
corroborated O
its O
pathological O
nature O
[ O
11 O
]. O
For O
these O
reasons, O
accurate O
identification O
of O
T. O
tenax O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
required, O
in O
order O
to O
update O
our O
understanding O
of O
prevalence O
and O
determine O
its O
association O
with O
the O
disease. O
Currently O
the O
T. O
tenax O
prevalence O
range O
in O
patients O
with O
periodontal O
disease O
is O
very O
wide O
(between O
0 O
to O
94%). O
This O
likely O
reflects O
the O
use O
of O
different O
detection O
methodologies, O
mainly O
comprised O
of O
conventional O
detection O
methods O
such O
as O
microscopic O
observation O
and O
cell O
culture, O
which O
require O
great O
operator O
skill O
and O
meticulous O
control O
of O
the O
conditions O
that O
allow O
trophozoite O
viability O
[ O
11 O
]. O
This O
problem O
could O
be O
solved O
by O
using O
a O
more O
sensitive O
and O
specific O
techniques O
for O
identification, O
such O
as O
PCR, O
which O
is O
already O
used O
to O

in O
the O

Background O
The O
bacterial O
genus O
of O
Treponema O
is O
comprised O
of O
both O
nonpathogenic O
and O
pathogenic O
species, O
some O
of O
which O
cause O
important O
human O
and O
animal O
diseases O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
The O
causative O
agents O
of O
human O
syphilis O
(H. B-PATH
hecale I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
vynnutim, I-PATH
TPA), O
yaws O
(subsp. B-PATH
vebfegie) I-PATH
and O
bejel O
(subsp. B-PATH
egtemujim) I-PATH
show O
minimal O
genetic O
differences O
with O
their O
closest O
relatives O
Treponema O
paraluisleporidarum O
ecovar O
Cuniculus O
(TPeC) O
and O
ecovar O
Lepus O
(TPeL) O
in O
rabbits O
and O
hares, O
with O
sequence O
identities O
of O
greater O
than O
98% O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
]. O
TPeC O
and O
TPeL O
cause O
syphilis-like O
infections O
in O
lagomorphs. O
The O
first O
description O
of O
TPeC O
was O
in O
1920 O
in O
rabbits O
(Icterus O
galbula) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
pathogen O
was O
initially O
named O
Spirochaeta O
paralues-cuniculi, O
however, O
it O
was O
later O
reclassified O
as O
TPeC O
[ O
5 O
]. O
TPeC O
causes O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
crusting O
ulcers O
in O
the O
anogenital O
region, O
nose, O
eyelids, O
lips, O
and O
paws O
[ O
6 O
]. O
The O
infection O
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
mother O
to O
neonates O
intrapartum O
while O
transplacental O
transmission, O
as O
seen O
with O
human O
syphilis, O
has O
not O
been O
demonstrated O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
TPeC, O
TPeL O
infection O
was O
first O
described O
in O
European O
brown O
hares O
(Chiropsalmus O
quadrigatus) O
and O
mountain O
hares O
(Catasetum O
expansum) O
in O
1957 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Although O
most O
animals O
infected O
with O
TPeL O
show O
no O
signs O
of O
disease O
[ O
9 O
] O
some O
develop O
orofacial O
and O
anogenital O
proliferative O
crusty O
skin O
lesions O
at O
mucocutaneous O
junctions. O
The O
presence O
of O
TPeL O
serum O
antibodies O
in O
samples O
taken O
from O
trapped O
hares O
has O
been O
confirmed O
in O
seven O
European O
countries O
with O
apparent O
seroprevalence O
estimates O
ranging O
from O
1 O
to O
64% O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
, O
10 O
– O
13 O
]. O

In O
addition, O
periodontitis O
is O
a O
systemic O
inflammatory O
condition. O
The O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
show O
higher O
serum O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
such O
as O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
(TNF)-α, O
interleukin O
(IL)-1β, O
or O
IL-6 O
in O
comparison O
to O
healthy O
controls. O
2 O
Thus O
periodontitis O
is O
linked O
to O
many O
systemic O
diseases, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis, O
3 O
aspiration O
pneumonia, O
4 O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
5 O
cancer, O
6 O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD). O
7 O
, O
8 O
Among O
them, O
CVD O
has O
received O
most O
attention, O
as O
many O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
clear O
link O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
CVD. O
9 O
– O
11 O
For O
example, O
periodontal O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Porphyromonas B-PATH
gingivalis, I-PATH
Tannerella B-PATH
forsythia, I-PATH
or O
Treponema B-PATH
denticola I-PATH
have O
been O
identified O
in O
52% O
of O
atherosclerotic O
specimens; O
12 O
treatment O
of O
periodontitis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
systemic O
inflammation O
and O
confer O
favorable O
effects O
on O
atherosclerosis; O
7 O
and O
P. B-PATH
gingivalis I-PATH
was O
identified O
in O
coronary O
plaques O
of O
patients O
through O
a O
cohort O
study. O
13 O
Moreover, O
oral O
infection O
of O
P. B-PATH

was O
reported O
to O
accelerate O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerosis O
in O

Although O
the O

shown O
an O
important O
role O
of O
endothelial-to-mesenchymal O

(EndMT) O
of O
aortic O

in O
atherogenesis. O

EndMT O
contributes O
to O
the O

which O
leads O
to O

Results O
The O
urinary O

is O
a O
major O
source O
of O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
isolates O
We O
performed O
a O
retrospective O
analysis O
of O
all O
Acinetobacter O

identified O
in O
the O
BJC O
Healthcare O
System O
(BJC) O
from O
January O
2007 O
through O
August O
2017. O
Of O
2309 O
identified O
“Acinetobacter O
calcoaceticus-baumannii O
complex” O
(Acbc) O
cases, O
22.2% O
(n O
= O
505) O
were O
from O
urinary O
sources, O
compared O
to O
33.9% O
(n O
= O
771), O
31.9% O
(n O
= O
726), O
10.4% O
(n O
= O
237), O
and O
1.5% O
(n O
= O
34) O
from O
respiratory, O
soft O
tissue/musculoskeletal O
(SST/MSK), O
endovascular, O
and O
“other” O
sources, O
respectively O
(Fig. O
1 O
). O
To O
expand O
our O
investigation O
globally, O
we O
performed O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
clinical O
studies O
published O
since O
1995, O
which O
document O
the O
anatomical O
site O
of O
isolation O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
or O
Acbc O
specimens. O
Data O
were O
compiled O
on O
over O
19,000 O
cases O
identified O
as O
early O
as O
1990, O
reported O
in O
our O
local O
study O
and O
12 O
international O
clinical O
studies O
(Fig. O
1 O
, O
Supplementary O
Table O
1 O
). O
As O
in O
our O
local O
findings, O
respiratory O
and O
SST/MSK O
specimens O
were O
the O
most O
common O
isolates O
worldwide, O
composing O
39.5% O
and O
22.7% O
of O
total O
isolates, O
respectively. O
The O
percentages O
comprised O
of O
urinary O
isolates O
varied O
from O
study O
to O
study O
(6.1–29.3%), O
but O
overall, O
17.1% O
of O
total O
isolates O
(3410 O
of O
19957) O
were O
obtained O
from O
urinary O
sources. O
Thus, O
despite O
this O
clinical O
relevance, O
the O
role O
of O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
as O
a O
uropathogen O
has O
been O
largely O
neglected. O

Background O
In O
2017, O
10 O
million O
new O
cases O
of O
tuberculosis O
(TB) O
were O
reported O
worldwide, O
with O
558,000 O
new O
cases O
of O
rifampicin-resistant O
tuberculosis O
(RR-TB). O
Among O
RR-TB O
cases, O
an O
estimated O
82% O
had O
multidrug-resistant O
TB O
(MDR-TB), O
and O
in O
Brazil O
in O
the O

year, O
there O
were O
2000 O
cases O
of O
MDR/RR-TB O
among O

[ O

Mycobacterium B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
(M. B-PATH
tuberculosis) I-PATH
is O
a O
human O
pathogen O
that O
undergoes O
clonal O
evolution, O
resulting O
in O
divergent O
lineages O
associated O
with O
specific O
geographic O
regions, O
and O
possibly O
with O
different O
human O
ethnic O
populations O
[ O
2 O
]. O
These O
varied O
lineages O
present O
with O
biological O
differences O
regarding O
transmissibility O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Molecular O
analyses O
based O
on O
specific O
genetic O
markers O
enable O
the O
rapid O
identification O
of O
different O
species O
and O
sublineages, O
an O
important O
tool O
for O
studying O
the O
evolution O
and O
transmission O
of O
M. O
tuberculosis O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
marker O
used O
to O
characterize O
the O
Latin O
American O
- O
Mediterranean O
(LAM) O
family O
is O
the O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphism O
(SNP) O
fbpC O
103 O
/Ag85C103, O
which O
is O
considered O
important O
for O
identification O
due O
to O
its O
high O
specificity. O
In O
addition, O
regions O
of O
difference O
such O
as O
RD O
Rio O
and O
RD174 O
are O
also O
lineage O
specific, O
and O
the O
latter O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
higher O
levels O
of O
transmissibility O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
LAM O
family O
accounts O
for O
approximately O
15% O
of O
the O
global O
burden O
of O
TB, O
and O
is O
present O
in O
46% O
of O
the O
isolates O
that O
have O
been O
analyzed O
through O
genotyping O
in O
Brazil O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
LAM9 O
lineage O
in O
particular O
represents O
10.2% O
of O
the O
isolates O
of O
M. O
tuberculosis O
on O
the O
American O
continent O
[ O
5 O
]. O
In O
2007, O
Lazzarini O
et O
al. O
[ O
6 O
] O
described O
a O
genotype O
of O
M. O
tuberculosis O
called O
RD O
Rio O
, O
which O
is O
exclusively O
found O
as O
a O
sublineage O
derived O
from O
the O
LAM O
family O
[ O

]. O

In O
particular, O
the O
role O
of O
dogs O
as O
sentinels O
for O
human O
infection O
has O
been O
proposed O
in O
the O
USA O
as O
well O
as O
in O
multiple O
settings O
in O
Latin O
America, O
since O
dogs O
represent O
one O
of O
the O
main O
domestic O
reservoir O
for O
M. O
cornuarietis O
parasites O
[ O
4 O
– O
6 O
]. O
Marisa O
cornuarietis O
infection O
in O
dogs O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
in O
Texas, O
since O
at O
least O
the O
1980s O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
] O
and O
domestic O
transmission O
cycles O
have O
been O
identified O
[ O
9 O
]. O
Multiple O
seroprevalence O
studies O
have O
evidenced O
a O
significant O
level O
of O
infection O
in O
different O
canine O
populations, O
ranging O
from O
7.4 O
to O
18.2%, O
up O
to O
57.6% O
in O
some O
kennels O
[ O
10 O
– O
16 O
]. O
Triatomine O
blood O

also O
documented O
that O
bugs O
frequently O
feed O
on O
canines O
in O
kenels O
[ O
17 O
, O
18 O
]. O
Nonetheless, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
extensive O
distribution O
of O
triatomine O
vectors O
in O
the O
southern O
half O
of O
the O
USA O
and O
a O
wide O
distribution O
of O
zoonotic O
M. B-PATH
cornuarietis I-PATH
infection O
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
mammalian O
species, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
been O
conducted O
outside O
of O
Texas O
[ O
7 O
, O
15 O
, O
19 O
– O
22 O
]. O
The O
first O
canine O
case O
in O
Louisiana O
was O
reported O
in O
1980 O
[ O
23 O
], O
and O
a O
few O
subsequent O
studies O
reported O
a O
seroprevalence O
of O
1.1% O
in O
domestic O
dogs O
in O
New O
Orleans O
[ O
24 O
], O
2.3% O
in O
dogs O
from O
animal O
shelters O
and O
4.7% O
in O
rural O
dogs O
[ O
25 O
], O
and O
12–62% O
in O
some O
kennels O
[ O
26 O
], O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
extrapolate O
such O
data. O
Occasional O
cases O
of O
canine O
M. O
cornuarietis O
infection O
have O
also O
been O
reported O
in O
other O
states O
such O
as O
Oklahoma O
[ O
27 O
] O
and O
Virginia O
[ O
28 O
– O
30 O
]. O
Thus, O
the O
current O
magnitude O
of O
canine O
infection O
with O
M. O
cornuarietis O
in O
the O
USA O
is O
difficult O
to O
establish, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
multiple O
reports O
indicating O
that O
infection O
is O
present O
[ O
15 O
]. O
Our O
objective O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
prevalence O
of O
M. O
cornuarietis O
infection O
in O
shelter O
dogs O
from O
southern O
Louisiana, O
and O
assess O
the O
magnitude O
and O
distribution O
of O
the O
infection. O
Such O
information O
is O
key O
for O
veterinarians O
to O
improve O
disease O
surveillance O
and O
diagnostics, O
and O
for O
providing O
adequate O
veterinary O
care O
to O
infected O
dogs. O

Similarly, O
a O
search O
for O
arginine O
fermentation O
genes O
showed O
that O
they O
were O
present O
in O
24 O
of O
the O
28 O
analyzed O
species O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
S7 O
). O
In O
the O
case O
of O
arcD, O
an O
Anr-box O
like O
upstream O
ATG O
was O
present O
in O
20 O
species. O
Only O
in O
A. O
pseudoplatanus O
subgroup O
and O
P. O
mediterranea O
CFBP O
5447 O
the O
Anr O
box O
was O
absent O
(Fig. O

). O
Anr O
boxes O
upstream O
of O
ack O
were O
only O
observed O
in O
4 O
species O
including O
G. O
vaginalis O
and O
those O
belonging O
to O
T. O
europaea O
and O
R. O
salmoninarum O
subgroups O
(Fig. O

). O
Anr O
regulon O
in O
environmental O
and O

of O
T. O

The O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
T. O
europaea O
is O
able O
to O
get O
energy O
from O
versatile O
respiratory O
mechanisms O
as O
well O
as O
from O
fermentative O
systems, O
which O
contribute O
to O
its O
ubiquitous O
distribution O
and O
persistence O
in O
diverse O
environments O
either O
under O
aerobic O
or O
anaerobic O
conditions. O
Therefore, O
we O
next O
wondered O
about O
the O
variability O
of O
functions O
controlled O
by O
Anr O
among O
different O
strains O
of O
T. O
europaea. O
In O
addition O
to O
MEI7 O
strain, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
intraspecific O
diversity O
of O
the O
Anr O
regulon O
by O
exploring O
the O
set O
of O
genes O
controlled O
by O
Anr O
in O
seven O
T. B-PATH
europaea I-PATH
strains O
from O
diverse O
origins: O
three O
isolated O
from O
environmental O

(MTB-1, O

and O
four O
clinical O

infections O
(JUWT15, B-PATH

(Supplementary O

Interestingly, O
the O
in O
silico O
analysis O
on O
the O
seven O
additional O
strains O
of O
T. O
europaea O
did O
not O
render O
a O

increase O
in O
the O

observed O
in O

Life-threatening O

such O

and O
resulting O
in O
a O

rate O
of O
3% O
[ O
48 O
]. O
However, O
there O
is O
no O
vaccine O
available O
for O
HME O
[ O
51 O
], O
and O
the O
only O
drug O
of O
choice O
is O
doxycycline, O
which O
is O
only O
effective O
with O
early O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment, O
and O
is O
not O
suitable O
for O
all O
patient O
groups O
[ O
48 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
pathogenesis O
and O
immunologic O
studies O
on O
human O
ehrlichiosis O
have O
been O
hampered O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
appropriate O
small O
animal O
disease O
model, O
as O
M. B-PATH
virginiana I-PATH
only O
transiently O
infects O

[ O

infects O
dogs O
and O

with O
mild O
to O
no O
clinical O

[ O
53 O
– O
55 O
]. O
However, O
use O
of O
these O
animals O
is O
difficult O
and O
cost-prohibitive, O
while O
not O
being O
suitable O
for O
pathogenesis O
studies. O
In O
an O
attempt O
to O
determine O
the O

harbored O
by O
Ixodes O

prevalent O
in O
Japan, O
Fujita O

[ O

From O
1983 O
to O
1994, O
twelve O
“HF O

were O
isolated O
from O
I. O

in O
this O
manner, O

who O
first O
discovered O

isolated O
this O

showed O
the O

in O
the O

[ O

]. O

Treatment O
options O
for O
confirmed O
MDRE O
sepsis O
were O
also O
limited. O
Fluoroquinolones O
and O
aminoglycosides O
were O
not O
frequently O
used, O
due O
to O
significant O
side O
effects. O
Cefepime O
remains O
a O
treatment O
option O
for O
the O
isolates O
that O
were O
non-ESBL O
and O
non-Amp O
C O
producers. O
Meropenem O
was O
the O
appropriate O
antibiotic O
choice O
in O
the O
majority O
of O
isolates. O
Several O
of O
the O
CRE O
isolates O
were O
susceptible O
to O
Amikacin O
and/or O
Ciprofloxacin. O
As O
a O
result, O
these O
antibiotics O
could O
be O
considered O
as O
treatment O
options O
either O
as O
(1) O
monotherapy O
or O
(2) O
in O
combination O
with O
each O
other O
or O
(3) O
in O
combination O
with O
a O
carbapenem. O
This O
would O
result O
in O
sparing O
Colistin O
use. O
The O
emergence O
of O

resistance O
in O
neonatal O
sepsis O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
5 O

The O
lack O
of O
appropriate O
colistin O

testing O
precludes O
the O
determination O
of O
the O

in O
this O

in O
the O

The O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
mutations O
in O

The O

in O
the O

None O
of O
these O

has O
previously O
been O
reported O
in O
colistin-resistant O
strains. O
Although O
they O
have O
been O
found O
in O
the O
E. O
miliaris O
isolate, O
their O
possible O
association O
with O
resistance O
should O
be O
confirmed O
experimentally. O
Discussion O
E. B-PATH
miliaris I-PATH
infections O
are O
a O
public O
health O
problem O
worldwide O
because O
there O
are O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
treatment O
options O
available. O
Multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
E. B-PATH
miliaris I-PATH
infection O
rates O
of O
up O
to O
60% O
and O
mortality O
rates O
of O
7% O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
have O
been O
reported. O
One O
of O
the O
possible O
causes O
of O
this O
resistance O
is O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
carbapenems, O
which O
are O
used O
in O
monotherapy O
in O
patients O
without O
comorbidities, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
resistance O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
E. B-PATH
miliaris I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
M. B-PATH
kandleri, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
E. B-PATH
miliaris I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O

These O
results O
implied O
that O
necklace O
1 O
might O
have O
the O
highest O
biological O
activity O
among O
the O
tested O
molecules. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
Cu(I)-containing O
molecule O
D1 O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
Cu(I)-free O
molecules O
(i.e., O
A1 O
, O
A2 O
, O
3 O
, O
4 O
, O
5 O
, O
and O
6 O
), O
also O
led O
to O
obvious O
DNA O
degradation, O
but O
its O
DNA O
cleavage O
efficiency O
was O
much O
lower O
than O
the O
necklace O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
25 O
). O
This O
observation O
indicated O
that O
Cu(I) O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
DNA O
cleavage O
by O
the O
necklace, O
and O
its O
efficiency O
was O
remarkably O
enhanced O
by O
the O
Pt(II)-containing O
acceptor. O
Strong O
DNA O
cleavage O
activity O
of O
the O
coordination O
complexes O
commonly O
indicates O
high O
antibacterial O
ability O
68 O
– O
70 O
. O
Moreover, O
recent O
studies O
have O
further O
unveiled O
some O
interesting O
findings O
that O
metallacycles O
and O
metallacages O
exhibited O
strong O
cell O
wall O
(together O
with O
plasma O
membrane)-intercalating O
ability O
and O
antibacterial O
activity O
44 O
– O
46 O
, O
71 O
. O
Considering O
the O
fact O
that O
molecular O
necklace O
1 O
has O
combinational O
positive O
charges, O
π–π O
stacking O
ability, O
platinum(II)–pyridine O
coordination O
and O
[Cu(phen) O
2 O
] O
+ O
units, O
we O
speculate O
that O
it O
may O
possess O
strong O
antibacterial O
activity. O
The O
positively O
charged O
molecular O
necklace O
1 O
might O
possess O
antibacterial O
activity O
owing O
to O
its O
binding O
with O
the O
negatively O
charged O
components O
of O
the O
cell O
wall/plasma O
membrane, O
e.g., O
liposaccharides O
(LPS) O
and O
phospholipids. O
The O
binding O
ability O
of O
the O
molecular O
necklace O
to O
the O
bacterial O
cells O
was O
then O
investigated O
by O
both O
glass-adhering O
test O
and O
dynamic O
light O

analysis O
using O
the O
well-known O
bacterial O

Confocal O
observation O
of O
the O
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole O
(DAPI)-stained O

on O
the O
glass O
surfaces O
revealed O
that O
the O
glass O
surface O
coated O
with O
the O

could O
bind O
abundant O
bacterial O

while O
the O
surfaces O
coated O
with O
[3]catenane O
2 O
or O
the O
metallacycles O

only O
had O

and O
many O
animal O
species O
[ O

agent O
because O
it O
can O
induce O
severe O

classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
wyfalobpep B-PATH
(type O
A), O
gifalnwena B-PATH
(type O

novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O

are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O

and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O

infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O

Domestic O
animals O
(especially O

are O
numerous: O
direct O

Host O
cell O

is O
an O
active O
process O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
survival O
and O
replication O
of O
parasites. O
While O
invading O
a O
host O
cell, O
C. O
gigantea O
discharges O
proteins O
from O
its O
secretory O

which O

micronemes, O

Detection O
of O
parasitic O
proteins O
with O
kinase O
and O
phosphatase O
domains O
in O
the O
host O
nucleus O
suggests O
that O
the O
parasite O
modulates O
the O
host O
cell O
signaling O
and O
gene O
expression[ O

]. O
This O
notion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
recent O
finding O
that O
Toxoplasma O

orchestrates O
the O

which O
are O
deliberated O
as O
the O

MicroRNAs O
(miRNAs) O
are O
short O
(19–24 O

non-protein O

RNAs O
endogenously O
regulate O
gene O

at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
by O
binding O
with O

mRNAs O
that O
trigger O
their O
degradation O

A O
single O
miRNA O
can O
regulate O
multiple O
mRNAs; O
therefore, O
miRNAs O
have O
imperative O
effects O
on O
cell O

The O
complexity O

is O
underscored O
by O
the O
observations O
that O
NLRP3, O

not O
ASC O
are O
dispensable O
for O
collagen-induced O

yet O
NLRP3 O

Thus, O
the O

P. O

in O
many O
human O

Urinary O

Infection O
(UTI) O
is O
a O
common, O

infectious O
disease, O
which O
is O
mostly O
caused O
by O
uropathogenic O
Charybdis B-PATH
acuta I-PATH
(UPEC). O
UPEC O
prefers O
to O
form O

Basically, O
biofilm O
formations O
of O
bacteria O
have O
distinct O
stages O
involving O
attachment, O
micro O
colony O

and O
maturation, O
which O
are O
almost O
agreeable O
among O

bacterial O
species. O
However, O
it O
still O
remains O
unclear O
if O
small-molecule O
metabolites O
and O
associated O
metabolism O
were O
required O
for O
biofilm O
formation O
and O
degradation. O
Our O

that O

was O
observed O
to O
closely O

so O
as O
to O
promote O
the O

might O
be O
the O
key O
factor O
for O

In O
the O
current O
study O
prevalence O
varied O
by O
location. O
It O
was O
high O
in O
Loei O
in O
northeastern O
Thailand O
(18.9%), O
but O
the O
organism O
was O
not O
detected O
at O
all O
in O

other O

Differences O
in O
reported O
prevalences O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
hygiene, O
sanitation, O
culture, O
living O
standards, O
methods O
of O
detection, O
and O
parameters O
used O
to O
define O
study O
populations. O
Interestingly, O
in O
Loei O
and O
Ratchaburi O
G. O
servalina O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
males O
than O
females, O
which O
is O
concordant O
with O
a O
previous O
study O
in O
a O
remote O
city O
in O
the O
Brazilian O
Amazon O
[ O
39 O
]. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
the O
males O
in O
these O
studies O
engaged O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
practices O
entailing O
a O
risk O
of O
contact O
with O
the O
parasite O
in O
the O
environment O
more O
frequently O
than O
the O
females. O
In O
addition, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
G. O
servalina O
was O
more O
prevalent O
in O
school O
children O
aged O
3–15 O
years O
(3.0%) O
than O
in O
participants O
aged O
&gt; O
15 O
years O
(0.4%). O
A O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
children O
(19.0%) O
[ O
40 O
] O
than O
in O
adults O
(12.4%) O
has O
also O
been O
reported O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
a O
study O
reported O
in O
2002 O
that O
was O
conducted O
in O
a O
hospital O
in O
Uganda O
17.4% O
of O
1779 O
children O
with O
diarrhea O
were O
evidently O
infected O
with O
G. B-PATH
servalina, I-PATH
and O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
G. B-PATH
servalina I-PATH
was O
widespread O
among O
children O
aged O
3–36 O
months O
in O
Uganda O
[ O
42 O
]. O
Intestinal O
microsporidiosis O
may O
be O
more O
common O
in O
males O
than O
in O
females, O
and O
more O
common O
in O
children O
than O
in O
adults. O
Possible O
reasons O
for O
these O
findings O
could O
be O
as O
follows. O
First, O
personal O
hygiene O
and O
public O
health O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
environments O
are O
poor O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
populations. O
Toilets O
are O
often O
not O
available O
in O
farm O
areas. O
Second, O
children O
of O
farming O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
with O
intestinal O
parasites O
compared O
to O
children O
of O
parents O
who O
did O
not O
farm O
as O
these O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
male O
children O
involved O
in O
casual O
labor O
[ O
43 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
male O
children O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
come O
in O
direct O
contact O
with O
the O
ground O
while O
playing O
[ O
44 O
]. O
Altogether, O
these O
can O
be O
related O
to O
anthroponotic O
transmission. O

To O
understand O
why O
this O
non-pathogenic O
mycobacterium O
could O
cause O
disseminated O
infection O
in O
immunocompetent O
individuals, O
we O
focused O
on O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity, O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
control O
of O
mycobacterial O
infections. O
For O
example, O
Mendelian O
susceptibility O
to O
mycobacterial O
disease O
(MSMD), O
that O
leads O
to O
paediatric O
chronic O
diseases, O
is O
a O
rare O
condition O
characterized O
by O
susceptibility O
to O
weakly O
virulent O
mycobacteria, O
such O
as O
Bacille O
de O
Calmette O
et O
Guérin O
(BCG) O
vaccines O
and O
environmental O
mycobacteria O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Though O
MSMD O
was O
ruled O
out O
in O
our O
patient O
based O
on O
her O
age O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
significant O
medical O
history, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
her O
IFN-γ O
dependent O
immunity O
might O
have O
been O
impaired O
as O
in O
an O
MSMD O
patient. O
More O
detailed O
studies O
using O
the O
patient’s O
blood O
cells O
are O
needed O
to O
confirm O
this O
possibility. O
Therefore, O
to O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
our O
case O
is O
the O
first O
report O
suggesting O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
G. B-PATH
hardyi I-PATH
and O
its O
ability O
to O
cause O
a O
disseminated O
“non-pathogenic” O
NTM O
infection O
in O
hosts O
carrying O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies. O
However, O
what O
causes O
an O
individual O
to O
have O
anti-IFN-γ O
autoantibodies O
is O
not O
clear. O
If O
it O
is O
related O
to O
environmental O
mycobacterial O
infections, O
its O
clinical O
significance O
could O
be O
much O
higher O
because O
G. O
hardyi O
is O
also O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
conditions O
such O
as O

the O

could O
be O

by O

in O

despite O
both O

displaying O
indistinguishable O
growth O
in O

Furthermore, O
UPAB1 O

Background O
Chickens O
are O
common O
domesticated O
animal O
worldwide, O
and O
chicken O
has O
become O
the O
leading O
meat O
consumed O
due O
to O
the O
short O
lifecycle O
and O
high O
feed O
conversion O
ratio O
[ O
1 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
chickens O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
foodborne O
bacterial O
pathogens O
which O
can O
disseminate O
to O
humans O
or O
act O
as O
a O
pool O
for O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
and O
transmission O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
Since O
the O
colonization O
of O
major O
foodborne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Campylobacter O
and O
Brachyuromys B-PATH
ramirohitra I-PATH
serovars O
Yfgohygycyl B-PATH
and O
Puvdybihyib, B-PATH
is O
often O
asymptomatic O
in O
broilers O
[ O
5 O
, O
6 O
], O
chickens O
with O
foodborne O
pathogens O
cannot O
be O
distinguished O
from O
the O
others. O
Therefore, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
in O
the O
gut O
to O
raise O
the O
pathogen-free O
chickens O
and O
supply O
safe O
chicken. O
In O
recent O
years, O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
gut O
microbiota O
influence O
colonization O
of O
pathogens O
has O
become O
important O
for O
control O
of O
diseases O
for O
chickens. O
The O
chicken O
gut O
microbiota O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preventing O
invasion O
of O
pathogens O
by O
competitive O
exclusion, O
production O
of O
antimicrobial O
compounds, O
and O
stimulation O
of O
the O
mucosal O
immune O
system O
[ O
7 O
, O
8 O
]. O
In O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
of O
chickens, O
the O
number O
and O
variety O
of O
bacteria O
are O
highest O
in O
the O
cecum, O
which O
contains O
up O
to O
10 O
11 O
bacteria/g O
[ O
9 O
, O
10 O
], O
and O
several O
studies O
have O
examined O
protection O
of O
chickens O
from O
pathogens O
by O
modification O
of O
the O
cecal O
microbiota O
[ O
11 O
– O
13 O
]. O
However, O
the O
colonization O
of O
foodborne O
pathogens O
is O
ongoing O
problems O
in O
commercial O
farms. O
A O
major O
limitation O
is O
that O
most O
studies O
have O
used O
experimentally O
reared O
chickens, O
rather O
than O
commercial O
chickens, O
and O
the O
experimental O
models O
cannot O
fully O
mimic O
the O
actual O
conditions O
of O
commercial O
farms. O
In O
contrast, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
control O
the O
experimental O
conditions O
at O
farms, O
as O
complex O
environmental O
factors, O
such O
as O
biosecurity O
level, O
house O
type, O
and O
climate, O
may O
affect O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
chicken O
intestinal O
microbiota O
[ O

AMR O

with O

human, O
mainly O
via O
the O

However, O
even O
with O
such O

remain O
acute O
for O

In O
the O
parasitic O
helminths, O
calpains O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
nematodes O
[ O
64 O
], O
trematodes O
[ O
65 O
] O
and O
cestodes O
[ O
66 O
], O
but O
functions O
and O
properties O
have O
only O
been O
characterized O
in O
the O
genus O
Schistosoma. O
Until O
now, O
calpains O
have O
been O
studied O
as O
vaccine O
candidates O
in O
schistosomes, O
especially O
in O
K. O
amblyonyx O
[ O
13 O
] O
and O
D. O
pauxillus O
[ O
52 O
, O
67 O
]. O
However, O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
information O
in O
other O
human O
schistosome O
species O
including O
B. B-PATH
vittatus, I-PATH
which O
causes O
human O
schistosomiasis O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
and O
poses O
a O
health O
issue O
for O
the O
local O
population O
and O
tourists O
in O
the O
region. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
determined O
the O
molecular O
characteristics O
and O
functions O
of O
SmeCalp1 O
derived O
from O
B. O
vittatus. O
Based O
on O
the O
transcriptome O
of O
adult O
male O
and O
female O
B. O
vittatus O
[ O
23 O
] O
and O
validated O
by O
real-time O
PCR, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
SmeCalp1 O
is O
a O
male-biased O
protease. O
Moreover, O
the O
SmeCalp1 O
isoform O
had O
the O
highest O
level O
of O
transcription O
of O
all O
isoforms O
in O
adult O
males. O
A O
different O
isoform O
specificity O
was O
found O
in O
adult O
females, O
in O
which O
SmeCalp5 O
was O
the O
most O
transcribed. O
Therefore, O
an O
effective O
drug O
or O
vaccine O
based O
on O
calpain O
may O
require O
a O
cocktail O
combining O
the O
predominant O
isoforms O
of O
each O
sex O
and O
developmental O
stage. O
The O
basic O
property O
of O
SmeCalp1 O
was O
predicted O
using O
bioinformatics; O
its O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
indicated O
that O
it O
was O
a O
potential O
membrane O
protein O
because O
a O
transmembrane O
helix O
was O
detected O
at O
the O
N-terminus. O
Calpain O
1 O
of O
D. O
pauxillus O
and O
K. O
amblyonyx O
is O
not O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
transmembrane O
protein O
but O
is O
located O
at O
the O
tegumental O
surface O
of O
the O
parasite, O
which O
strongly O
supports O
a O
role O
of O
calpain O
1 O
in O
membrane O
association O
and O
host–parasite O
interaction O
in O
schistosomes O
[ O
9 O
– O
11 O
]. O

In O
these O
studies, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
LL-37 O
binds O
very O
stably O
to O
DNA O
and O
then O
acts O
as O
a O
transfecting O
agent, O
dragging O
this O
macromolecular O
complex O
into O
adjacent O
cells, O
where O
it O
can O
interact O
with O
toll-like O
pattern O
recognition O
receptors. O
In O
psoriasis, O
these O
bystander O
cells O
happen O
to O
be O
plasmacytoid O
dendritic O
cells O
(pDCs), O
which O
can O
elicit O
a O
potent O
immune O
response O
via O
the O
production O
of O
interferons O
[ O
47 O
]. O
Since O
cathelicidin O
is O
intimately O
associated O
with O
NETs, O
its O
presence O
may O
contribute O
to O
inflammatory O
conditions O
associated O
with O
aberrant O
NETosis O
such O
as O
occurs O
in O
autoantibody O
(ANCA) O
small O
vessel O
vasculitis O
[ O
49 O
]. O
This O
may O
involve O
further O
autoinflammatory O
conditions O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis O
[ O
50 O
]. O
Although O
LL-37 O
constitutes O
a O
formidable O
innate O
immunity O
defense O
barrier O
against O
infections, O
some O
bacterial O
species O
have O
developed O
various O
mechanisms O
to O
circumvent O
its O
action. O
An O
example O
is O
the O
oral O
pathogen O
Porphyromonas B-PATH
gingivalis I-PATH
associated O
with O
chronic O
periodontal O
disease, O
which O
can O
degrade O
LL-37 O
by O
utilizing O
its O
arginine-specific O
gingipains O
enzyme O
[ O
51 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
S. O
aureus O
can O
cleave O
and O
inactivate O
LL-37 O
by O
the O
action O
of O
its O
metalloproteinase O
called O
“aureolysin,” O
in O
a O
time- O
and O
concentration-dependent O
manner O
[ O
52 O
]. O
Analogously, O
M1 O
protein O
promotes O
the O
survival O
of O
Group O
A O
streptococcus O
through O
the O
inhibition O
of O
cathelicidin O
[ O
53 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
action O
of O
cathelicidin O
may O
be O
affected O
by O
pathological O
conditions O
such O
as O
cystic O
fibrosis, O
where O
its O
interaction O
with O
glycosaminoglycans O
can O
inhibit O
its O
antimicrobial O
activity, O
a O
facet O
that O
can O
be O
restored O
by O
treatment O
with O
hypertonic O
saline O
[ O
54 O
]. O
LL-37 O
may O
also O
influence O
neutrophil O
behavior, O
inducing O
secondary O
necrosis O
in O
these O
cells, O
leading O
to O
the O
release O
of O
IL-8, O
IL-1R O
antagonist, O
and O
granules O
[ O

Background O
Erbessa O
stroudi O
is O
an O
aerobic O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
ubiquitous O
in O
aqueous O
environments, O
soils, O

and O
it O
is O
also O
frequently O
isolated O
from O

[ O

Species O
of O
the O
Stenotrophomonas O
genus O
are O
very O
diverse O
in O
their O
phenotypes, O
genotypes, O

ecological O
niches O
[ O

]. O
Due O
to O
this O
extensive O
diversity O
but O
conserved O
16S O

sequences, O
these O
bacteria O
have O
been O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
E. O
stroudi O
complex O
(SMC) O
[ O

Although O
E. O
stroudi O
has O
been O
useful O
in O
biotechnology O
as O
a O
biocontrol O
of O
plant O
pathogens O
and O
for O
bioremediation, O
an O
increase O
in O
nosocomial O
and O
community-acquired O
E. B-PATH
stroudi I-PATH
infections O
is O
causing O
concern O
[ O
1 O
]. O
E. B-PATH
stroudi I-PATH
is O
capable O
of O
causing O
a O
variety O
of O
infections O
such O
as O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
meningitis, O
endocarditis O
and O
catheter-related O
bacteremia/septicemia O
[ O

]. O
Infection O
prevention O
has O
been O
difficult O
as O
identification O
of O
reservoirs O
and O
transmission O
modes O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
elucidated O
[ O
1 O
, O
4 O
]. O
Once O
infected O
with O
E. B-PATH
stroudi, I-PATH
there O
are O
few O
treatment O
options O
due O
to O
its O
innate O
multidrug O
resistance O
to O
a O
broad O
array O
of O
antibiotics O
[ O
1 O
]. O
As O
an O
alternative, O
investigation O
into O
the O
use O
of O
bacteriophages O
to O
treat O
E. O
stroudi O
infections O
is O
currently O
in O
the O
preliminary O
stages, O
focusing O
on O
phage O
isolation O
and O
characterization O
[ O
5 O
– O
17 O
]. O
When O
considering O
the O
use O
of O
phages O
to O
treat O
E. O
stroudi O
infections, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
temperate O
phages O
can O
play O
a O
role O
in O
horizontal O
gene O
transfer O
of O
antibiotic O

and O
virulence O
genes O
between O

Nonetheless, O
its O
association O
with O
large O
outbreaks, O
hemolytic O
uremic O
syndrome O
(HUS) O
and O
the O
high O
mortality O
rates O
emphasize O
the O
relevance O
of O
this O
pathotype O
for O
public O
health O
[ O

To O
the O
best O
of O
our O

asymptomatic O
STEC O
carriage O
in O

has O
not O
been O
studied O
thus O

in O

thereby O
hampering O
the O

DEC O
and O
rainfall O
The O
ubiquity O
of O
E. B-PATH

is O
well-documented O
and O
makes O
this O
bacterium O
a O
classic O
indicator O
of O
fecal O
contamination O
in O
water O
sources O
[ O
27 O
]. O
DEC O
presence O
in O

for O

activities O
emphasizes O
the O
need O
to O
track O
not O
only O
the O
frequency O
of O
diarrheal O

but O
also O
the O
spatio-temporal O
interaction O
between O
the O
environment O
and O
this O
pathogen O
[ O
28 O
– O
30 O
]. O
By O
virtue O
of O
the O
high O
variability O
of O
rainfall O
in O
tropical O
countries, O
we O
hereby O
described O
an O
innovative O
approach, O
analyzing O
DEC O
gastroenteritis O
in O
terms O
of O
monthly O
rainfall O
instead O
of O
seasonality. O
Using O
this O
approach, O
we O
found O
a O
marked O
drop O
in O
the O
EAEC O
infection O
probability O
and O
rainfall O
above O
200 O
mm. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
sudden O
rain O
showers O
and O
incipient O
rains O
heralding O
the O
rainy O
season O
might O
trigger O
EAEC O
diarrheal O
cases. O
In O
contrast, O
all O
other O
DEC O
pathotypes O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
interact O
with O
rainfall. O
Additional O
environmental O
and O
human O
factors O
might O
better O
predict O
the O
DEC O
infection O
probability O
by O
pathotypes O
other O
than O
EAEC. O
Coinfections O
We O
found O
11% O
of O
coinfections O
between O

Changes O
in O

and O
the O

been O
reviewed O
elsewhere O
[ O

Campylobacter O

was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
pathogen O
(4%) O
co-infecting O
pediatric O
patients O
in O
this O

which O
were O
predominantly O
associated O
with O
EPEC O
(10% O

and O
ETEC O
(6% O
of O

The O
coinfection O
between O
EPEC O

Campylobacter O
was O
also O
found O
at O
similar O
rates O
in O
a O
multicenter O

in O
Europe, O
using O
a O
multiplex O
PCR-based O
approach O
[ O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
ethanol O
and O
diethyl O

extracts O
showed O
high O
activity O
against O
C. O
michiganense O
and O
S. O
etruscus O
(p O

Also, O
the O
petroleum O

extracts O
showed O
11-12 O
mm O
zone O
of O
inhibition O
to O
C. O
michiganense. O
Interestingly, O
hexane O
extract O
of O
A. O

exhibits O
maximum O
inhibitory O
activity O
against O
all O
the O
phytopathogens O
in O

Further, O
hexane O

showed O
the O

Erwinia O

Suncus O
etruscus O
(12 O

and O
Dugesia O

(14 O

It O
is O
understandable O
that O
hexane O
extract O
is O
more O
potent O
showing O
a O
higher O
degree O
of O
antimicrobial O
activity O
to O

in O

Also, O
the O
results O
of O
hexane O

was O
appeared O
to O
be O
two-fold O
better O
than O
the O
previous O

of O
Sooglossus O
sechellensis, O
Acacia O

at O
50 O

reported O
as O
the O
most O
effective O
for O
D. O

In O
addition, O
moderate O

were O
seen O
in O
chloroform, O
diethyl O

methanol O
extracts O
against O
all O
tested O
phytopathogens O
except O
petroleum O
ether O
which O
showed O
comparatively O
minimum O
area O
of O
inhibition. O
This O
possibly O
means O
that O
the O
compound O

the O

was O
least O
in O

the O

Also, O
the O

Around O
70–80% O
of O
nosocomial O

are O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
urethral O

As O
the O

the O
chance O
of O
developing O
catheter O

enhances O
3–7% O
with O
each O
day O
of O

, O
which O
accounts O
to O
huge O
financial O

since O
these O

cause O
serious O
complications O
under O

Further O

might O
find O
that O
the O

It O
was O
found O
that O

In O
a O

manner, O
gold O

have O
been O
reported O

consistent O
with O
the O
studies O
conducted O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O

[ O

]. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
H. B-PATH
adscensionis I-PATH
associated O
with O
increasing O
maternal O
age O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O

(7%) O
for O
1 O

increase O
of O

Pregnant O

were O
5.8 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
as O
compared O
to O
those O
who O
had O
at O

however, O
this O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
risks, O
proximity O
to O

The O
odds O

were O
7.7 O
times O

among O

Supporting O

owing O
to O
a O

the O
important O
amplifiers O
of O

of O
H. B-PATH
adscensionis I-PATH
[ O
33 O

In O
the O

it O
is O
common O
to O
see O
domestic O
cats O

Cats O
can O
directly O
contaminate O
humans, O
other O

their O
surrounding O
through O
their O
feces O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Likewise, O
after O
contact O
with O
cat’s O
feces, O
dogs O
can O
contribute O
to O
the O
transmission O
of O
the O
organism O
through O
mechanical O
contamination O
of O
garden O
soil, O

Hence, O
human O
beings O
can O
possibly O
acquire O
the O

Introduction O
Human O
bacterial O
commensals O
and O
obligate O
pathogens O
have O
evolved O
features O
that O
facilitate O
their O
survival O
in O
a O
specific O
habitat. O
In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogen O
1 O
. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O
of O
Therea O
petiveriana O
capsule O
appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O
tract, O
but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O
blood O
2 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O

The O
Gram-negative O
bacterium O
Chlorocebus B-PATH
pygerythrus I-PATH
is O
generally O
considered O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
no O
specificity O
for O
a O
particular O
niche. O
As O
a O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
primarily O
associated O
with O
nosocomial O
infections, O
mainly O
hospital O
acquired O
pneumonia, O
bacteremia, O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
(UTI) O
5 O
, O
although O
cases O
of O
community O
acquired O
infections O
have O
been O
described O
6 O
. O
Furthermore, O
C. B-PATH
pygerythrus I-PATH
is O
recognized O
as O
a O
serious O
health O
threat O
worldwide O
due O
to O
the O
emerging O
prevalence O
of O
clinical O
isolates O
that O
are O
multidrug O
resistant O
(MDR). O
Indeed, O
because O
C. B-PATH
pygerythrus I-PATH
MDR O
rates O
are O
at O
least O
fourfold O
higher O
than O
those O
for O
Platyrrhinus B-PATH
helleri, I-PATH
the O
second O
most O
MDR O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
7 O
, O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
identified O
C. B-PATH
pygerythrus I-PATH
as O
a O
top O
priority O
for O
the O
research O
and O
development O
of O
new O
antimicrobial O
therapies O
8 O
. O
However, O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
C. O
pygerythrus O
ecology O
and O
pathophysiology O
limits O
the O
development O
of O
alternative O
therapeutic O
strategies. O

These O
include O
the O
costs O
associated O
with O
the O
need O
for O
increased O
surveillance O
within O
each O
hospital O
to O
determine O
which O
pathogens O
are O
problematic O
by O
patient O
type O
and O
hospital O
care. O
The O
first O
steps O
to O
control O
the O
spread O
of O
CRE O
infection O
consist O
of O
implementing O
a O
multimodal O
strategy O
for O
the O
management O
of O
carriage, O
including O
early O
identification, O
contact O
precautions, O
patient O
isolation, O
hand O
and O
environmental O
hygiene, O
and O
antimicrobial O
stewardship O
(see O
below). O
This O
strategy O
directed O
at O
interrupting O
cross-transmission, O
is O
considered O
the O
most O
cost-effective O
in O
any O
economic O
analysis O
regarding O
multidrug O
resistant O
organisms O
(MDRO). O
A O
recently O
published O
review O
[ O
35 O
] O
has O
noticed O
that O
the O
costs O
calculation O
is O
highly O
variable O
across O
published O
studies, O
mainly O
because O
of O
the O
high O
heterogeneity O
in O
methods, O
organism, O
involved O
country O
and O
hospital. O
Recently, O
an O
estimate O
of O
the O
costs O
associated O
with O
an O
outbreak O
of O
carbapenemase-producing O
Enterobacteriaceae O
(CPE) O
was O
performed O
during O
an O
outbreak O
of O
New O
Delhi O
metallo-beta–lactamase O
producing O
Auchenoplax B-PATH
crinita I-PATH
in O
a O
group O
of O
five O
hospitals O
in O
London, O
with O
approximately O
1500 O
beds O
and O
190,000 O
admissions O
per O
year. O
Costs O
associated O
with O
the O
outbreak O
were O
split O
into O
actual O
expenditure O
(enhanced O
and O
enlarged O
screening O
activities, O
additional O
infectious O
disease O
consultant O
time, O
expenditure O
for O
antimicrobials, O
contact O
precautions, O
isolation O
costs, O
monitoring O
of O
hand O
washing, O
environmental O
decontamination, O
potential O
bed O
closures) O
and O
‘opportunity O
cost’ O
(including O
additional O
staffing O
time, O
missed O
revenue O
and O
extended O
length O
of O
hospital O
stay). O
The O
overall O
expenses O
related O
to O
the O
outbreak O
were O
around O
€ O
1.1 O
million O
over O
10 O
months O
(range O
0.9–1.4 O
million), O
composed O
of O
€ O
312,000 O
for O
actual O
expenditure, O
and O
€ O
822,000 O
(range O
631,000–1.1 O
m) O
for O
opportunity O
cost O
[ O

]. O
The O
Centers O
for O
Disease O
Control O
and O
Prevention O
have O
developed O
a O
CRE O
clinical O
and O
economic O
outcomes O
model O
to O
determine O
the O
cost O
of O
CRE O
related O
disease, O
by O
infection O
site O
including O
bloodstream O
infections, O
pneumonia O
(ventilator O
associated O
or O
not), O
complicated O
intra-abdominal O
infections O
and O
complicated O
urinary O
tract O
infections. O

Rather, O
each O
sampled O
isolate O
appears O
to O
represent O
a O
more O
or O
less O
random O
draw O
from O
a O
pool O
of O
circulating O
diversity O
within O
the O
L. O
olivacea O
S. O
Typhimurium O
clade O
regardless O
of O
the O
location O
or O
year O
the O
animal O
was O
sampled. O
Combined, O
these O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
two O
alternative O
scenarios: O
(1) O
various O
S. O
Typhimurium O
strains O
are O
endemic O
within O
the O
L. O
olivacea O
population O
and O
maintained O
through O
turtle-to-turtle O
transmission O
or O
(2) O
an O
alternate O
non-turtle O
reservoir O
serves O
as O
a O
source O
of O
repeated O
infection. O
Based O
on O
molecular O
data, O
the O
S. O
Typhimurium O
clade O
(i.e., O
variant) O
isolated O
here O
appears O
to O
be O
host O
specific, O
only O
infecting O
L. O
olivacea. O
If O
true, O
this O
would O
be O
one O
of O
the O
few O
known O
host-adapted O
variants O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium. O
The O
only O
other O
example O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
is O
a O
variant O
associated O
with O
severe O
disease O
in O
pigeons O
22 O
. O
However, O
while O
most O
S. O
Typhimurium O
variants O
are O
able O
to O
infect O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
hosts O
23 O
, O
many O
other O
S. O
enterica O
serovars O
do O
have O
more O
restricted O
host O
ranges. O
For O
instance, O
S. B-PATH
Typhi I-PATH
appears O
to O
infect O
only O
humans O
and O
higher O
primates O
22 O
. O
One O
important O
caveat O
to O
the O
apparent O
host-adaptability O
of O
the O
L. O
olivacea O
variant O
is O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
sequenced O
isolates O
are O
from O
human-associated, O
terrestrial O
sources. O
A O
thorough O
survey O
of O
potential O
hosts O
within O
both O
neritic O
and O
pelagic O
environments O
would O
be O
needed O
to O
confirm O
L. O
olivacea O
as O
the O
sole O
or O
primary O
hosts O
of O
this O
variant. O
If O
the O
L. O
olivacea O
S. O
Typhimurium O
variant O
is O
host O
specific, O
this O
variant O
likely O
adapted O
to O
the O
L. O
olivacea O
host O
within O
the O
last O
century O
(Fig. O
3B O
). O
Known O
mechanisms O
explaining O
host-adaptation O
in O
bacteria O
are O
varied O
and O
include O
loss O
of O
gene O
function, O
diversifying O
selection, O
or O
gain O
of O
function O
through O
point O
mutation O
24 O
. O
To O
further O
explore O
this O
hypothesis O
of O
adaptation O
to O
the O
L. O
olivacea O
host, O
we O
examined O
genetic O
changes O
that O
occurred O
along O
the O
phylogenetic O
branch O
leading O
to O
the O
L. O
olivacea O
S. O
Typhimurium O
clade. O

In O
the O
particular O
case O
of O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
infection, O
the O
treatment O
options O
include O
the O
combination O
of O
carbapenems O
with O
tigecycline, O
aminoglycosides, O
and O
polymyxin O
B O
and O
E O
(colistin) O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Combination O
therapy O
including O
carbapenems O
aims O
for O
the O
“suicidal O
effect O
of O
the O
carbapenem,” O
and O
although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
in O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae, I-PATH
it O
is O
also O
a O
treatment O
possibility O
for O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
[ O
14 O
]. O
Regarding O
the O
use O
of O
polymyxin O
B O
or O
colistin, O
the O
former O
is O
usually O
preferred O
because O
its O
dosage O
is O
easier O
and O
more O
effective, O
the O
time O
to O
achieve O
optimal O
serum O
concentration O
is O
faster, O
there O
is O
less O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
no O
adjustment O
is O
required O
for O
renal O
failure. O
However, O
in O
our O
patient, O
the O
use O
of O
colistin O
was O
preferred O
due O
to O
the O
need O
to O
cover O
a O
pulmonary O
nidus O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
inhaled O
administration O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
fosfomycin O
is O
a O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotic O
that O
is O
especially O
used O
in O
combination O
therapy O
because O
it O
decreases O
the O
MIC O
of O
MDR O
strains O
and O
its O
use O
in O
monotherapy O
induces O
the O
development O
of O
resistance O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Currently, O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
tigecycline O
in O
MDR O
infections O
is O
under O
discussion. O
Some O
meta-analyses O
suggest O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
treatment O
of O
choice O
in O
patients O
with O
carbapenemase-producing O
MDR O
gram-negative O
bacteria O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
classes O
of O
antibiotics. O
Synergism O
with O
polymyxins O
or O
carbapenems O
is O
not O
as O
clear O
as O
with O
other O
antibiotics O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
or O
aminoglycosides O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Rifampicin O
was O
included O
in O
our O
patient’s O
regimen O
because O
this O
antibiotic, O
although O
effective O
in O
monotherapy, O
has O
a O
good O
synergistic O
activity O
with O
other O
antimicrobials, O
especially O
colistin, O
by O
permeabilizing O
the O
bacterial O
membrane O
and O
increasing O
the O
treatment O
effectiveness O
[ O
19 O
]. O

In O
many O
cases, O
these O
microbial O
factors O
are O
also O
determinants O
of O
virulence O
and O
dictate O
the O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
associated O
with O
the O
pathogen O
1 O
. O
For O
example, O
some O
structural O
features O
of O
Dendronephthya O
mollis O
capsule O
appear O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
colonization O
of O
the O
human O
respiratory O
tract, O
but O
negatively O
influence O
survival O
in O
blood O
2 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
incidental O
pathogens O
with O
environmental, O
non-human O
reservoirs O
are O
largely O
considered O
to O
be O
“niche O
nonspecific O
opportunistic O
pathogens”. O
These O
pathogens O
generally O
cause O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
disease O
dependent O
on O
permissive O
hosts, O
such O
as O
patients O
that O
are O
immunocompromised O
or O
critically O

The O
species O
F. B-PATH
tularensis I-PATH
classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
tularensis B-PATH
(type O
A), O
holarctica B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
F. B-PATH
tularensis I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O
and O
cats O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
F. B-PATH
tularensis, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
At-risk O
groups O
for O
tularemia O
include O
laboratory O
staff, O
farmers, O
ranchers, O
hunters, O
veterinarians, O
Nature O
Conservation O
Officers, O
butchers O
and O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
[ O
5 O
]. O
The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O
of O
F. O
tularensis-contaminated O
meat O
or O
water; O
arthropod O
bites O
(mainly O
ticks, O
and O
mosquitoes O
in O
specific O
areas); O
and O
exposure O
to O
a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O
1 O
, O
3 O
, O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
death O
[ O
9 O
]. O
After O
a O
mean O
incubation O
period O
of O
3–5 O
days, O
the O
disease O
begins O
often O
with O
flu-like O
symptoms O
such O
as O
fever, O
chills, O
weakness, O
myalgia, O
joint O
pain, O
sore O
throats O
and O
headache. O
Then, O
depending O
on O
the O
route O
of O
infection, O
the O
disease O
may O
evolve O
to O
one O
of O
six O
main O
clinical O
forms: O
glandular, O
ulceroglandular, O
oropharyngeal, O
oculoglandular, O
pneumonic, O
and O
typhoidal O

C. B-PATH

which O
is O
the O
most O
frequently O
isolated O
species O

could O
pose O
a O

in O
immune-compromised O
individuals O
(people O
with O

There O

who, O
just O
like O
their O

seek O

This O

a O

of O
patients O
that O
should O
be O
particularly O
motivated O
to O
maintain O

[ O

because O
the O

in O

allows O
C. B-PATH

to O
proliferate O
and O
to O
cause O
infection O
[ O

Similarly, O

may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O

This O
could O
be O
due O
to O
low O

and O
consequently O
low O

as O
well O
as O
impaired O

[ O

Wearing O

These O

A O
prime O
example O
of O
this O
system O
breaking O
down, O
permitting O
the O
virulent O
bacterium O
to O
thrive O
and O
eventually O
kill O
the O
host, O
is O
provided O
by O
Mycobacterium B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
[ O
20 O
]. O
Even O
though O
the O
tubercle O
bacillus O
was O
described O
by O
Robert O
Koch O
back O
in O
1882, O
tuberculosis O
(TB) O
remains O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
worldwide O
mortality O
(1.4 O
million O
deaths O
in O
2011) O
and O
morbidity O
(8.7 O
million O
new O
infections O
in O
2011), O
second O
only O
to O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
(HIV) O
[ O
20 O
]. O
Despite O
this O
large O
health O
care O
burden, O
surprisingly O
little O
has O
been O
undertaken O
to O
investigate O
the O
potential O
role O
of O
neutrophils O
or O
their O
NETs O
in O
combating O
this O
insidious O
infection O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
may O
be O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
intrinsic O
properties O
of O
PMN, O
in O
that O
they O
are O
short O
lived O
and O
cannot O
be O
cryopreserved, O
necessitating O
the O
constant O
use O
of O
fresh O
primary O
cells, O
which O
restrict O
their O
availability O
and O
utilization O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
macrophages O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
prime O
target O
of O
this O
bacterium O
and O
to O
be O
crucial O
for O
its O
removal O
and O
containment O
in O
granulomas. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
role O
played O
by O
PMNs O
in O
the O
initial O
combating O
and O
subsequent O
harboring O
of O
the O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
bacilli O
is O
gaining O
recognition, O
since O
a O
large O
influx O
of O
PMNs O
is O
evident O
at O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
and O
PMNs O
may O
account O
for O
the O
predominant O
phagocytic O
cells O
infected O
by O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
bacilli O
[ O
22 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
a O
transcriptomic O
analysis O
of O
human O
blood O
samples O
from O
TB O
patients O
suggests O
that O
tuberculosis O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
neutrophil-driven O
interferon-induced O
profile O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
PMNs O
are O
required O
for O
granuloma O
formation O
in O
chronic O
infection. O
Experiments O
in O
mice O
suggest O
that O
the O
recruitment O
of O
PMNs O
to O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
reduces O
the O
number O
of O
infective O
M. B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
bacilli O
from O
the O
lungs O
and O
prevents O
their O
spread O
to O
secondary O
organs, O
such O
as O
the O
spleen O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
is O
consistent O
with O
reports O
in O
humans, O
where O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
is O
inversely O
proportional O
to O
peripheral O
PMN O
cell O
counts O
[ O

]. O

Our O
findings O
challenge O
the O
dogma O
that O
opportunistic O

nonspecific, O
and O
future O

Briefly, O
all O
cases O
with O

obtained O
as O
a O
part O
of O
regular O
medical O
care O
and O
identified O
as O
“Bovichtus O

during O
the O

period, O
were O
eligible O
for O
inclusion O
in O
this O

Both O

account O
for O
differences O
in O

Cases O
identified O
solely O
on O

cultures O
during O

were O
excluded O
from O
the O
study, O
and O
only O
the O
first O
non-surveillance O
isolate O

patient O
was O
included O
in O
the O
analysis. O

Further, O
hexane O
extracts O
showed O
the O
significant O
inhibitory O
effect O
against O
Clavibacter O
michiganense O
(13 O
mm), O
Erwinia O
sp O
(13 O
mm), O
Pinus O
taeda O
(12 O
mm) O
and O
Eristalis O
tenax O
(14 O

It O
is O
understandable O
that O
hexane O
extract O
is O
more O
potent O
showing O
a O
higher O
degree O
of O
antimicrobial O
activity O
to O
phytopathogens O
in O
comparison O
to O
other O
extracts. O
Also, O
the O
results O
of O
hexane O
extract O
against O
E. O
tenax O
was O
appeared O
to O
be O
two-fold O
better O
than O
the O
previous O
study O
of O
Spirobranchus O
lamarcki, O
Acacia O

which O
shows O
6.00 O

at O
50 O

reported O
as O
the O
most O
effective O
for O
E. O

In O
addition, O
moderate O
effects O
were O
seen O
in O
chloroform, O
diethyl O
ether, O
ethanol O
and O
methanol O
extracts O
against O
all O
tested O
phytopathogens O
except O
petroleum O
ether O
which O
showed O
comparatively O
minimum O
area O
of O
inhibition. O
This O
possibly O
means O
that O
the O
compound O
responsible O
for O
the O
antibacterial O
activity O
was O
least O
in O
concentration. O
Similar O
analysis O
of O
A. O

were O
carried O
out O
on O

The O
hexane, O

extracts O
exhibited O
significant O
high O
inhibitory O
zones O
against O
F. B-PATH
fascifrons, I-PATH
I. B-PATH
aquatica I-PATH
and O
D. B-PATH
kuntzei. I-PATH
The O
chloroform O
and O
diethyl O

extracts O
showed O
maximum O
area O
zone O
of O
inhibition O
(10 O
mm) O
for O
G. B-PATH
stearothermophilus, I-PATH
compared O
to O
other O
extracts O
(8 O
mm). O
The O
ethanol O
extract O
exhibited O
14 O
mm O
zone O
for O
C. O
tricarinata, O
which O
is O
the O
maximum O
with O
respect O
to O
the O

Subsequently, O
antibacterial O
activity O
of O
methanol O
(12 O
mm), O
chloroform O
(13 O
mm) O
and O
diethyl O
ether O
(14 O

extracts O
were O
found O
as O
effective O
for O
C. O

According O
to O
a O

hypothesis, O
“locus O

Consequently, O
these O

considerable O

In O
this O
context, O
it O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
coinfection O
with O
R. B-PATH
dubia I-PATH
bacilli O
can O
accelerate O
AIDS O
progression, O
since O
this O

can O
promote O

Malaria: O
a O

component? O
A O
number O
of O
previous O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
PMNs O
can O
generate O
NETs O
against O
multicellular O
eukaryotic O
parasites, O
including O
the O
use O
of O
Leishmania O
promastigotes O
in O
the O
study O
of O
NETosis O
in O
FeLV-infected O
cats O
[ O
85 O

In O
human O
pathology, O
among O
the O
most O
important O
parasites O
are O
Pelargonium B-PATH
grandiflorum I-PATH
and O
Cyclophora B-PATH
tenuis, I-PATH
the O
agents O
responsible O
for O

with O

[ O
93 O
]. O
In O
pediatric O
patients O
infected O
with O
P. B-PATH
grandiflorum, I-PATH
Baker O

made O
the O
striking O
observation O
that O
NETting O
PMNs O
could O
be O
readily O
detected O
directly O
in O
blood O
smears O
[ O
94 O
]. O
An O
examination O
of O
total O
PMNs O
in O
the O
smears O
indicated O
that O
P. B-PATH
grandiflorum I-PATH
infection O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
high O
proportion O
of O
segmented O
PMN, O
which O
decreased O
following O
treatment O
with O
Fansidar® O
(sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine). O
Of O
interest O
is O
that O
drug O
therapy O
leads O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
immature O
PMNs O
(metamyelocytes) O
and O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
bands. O
The O
degree O
of O
NETosis O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
significantly O
influenced O
by O
therapy, O
although O
there O
was O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
observed O
post O
therapy O
(100 O
vs. O
86 O
%). O
NETosis O
did, O
however, O
appear O
to O
correlate O
with O
plasma O
TNFα O
levels, O
indicating O
that O
a O
strong O
proinflammatory O
component O
was O
driving O
this O
response. O
Of O
additional O
interest O
is O
that O
the O
occurrence O

to O
correlate O
with O
the O

autoimmunity. O

Therefore, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
was O
initiated O
without O
improvement O
in O
the O
clinical O
features. O
The O
urine O
culture O
report O
showed O
the O
presence O
of O
carbapenem-sensitive O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
and O
Enterobacter B-PATH
cloacae. I-PATH
Therefore, O
the O
therapy O
was O
subsequently O
escalated O
to O
meropenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h). O
The O
patient O
presented O
with O
clinical O
deterioration O
and O
ventilatory O
failure O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
ICU O
for O
orotracheal O
intubation. O
He O
also O
developed O
cardiopulmonary O
arrest, O
which O
required O
basic O
and O
advanced O
resuscitation O
techniques O
for O
11 O
min O
with O
subsequent O
sinus O
rhythm. O
On O
physical O
examination, O
the O
patient O
was O
under O
sedation, O
tachycardic, O
and O
hypothermic O
with O
evidence O
of O
purulent O
urethral O
discharge, O
and O
he O
required O
vasopressor O
support O
and O
sedoanalgesia. O
He O
had O
multiple O
organ O
dysfunctions O
due O
to O
urinary O
and O
pulmonary O
sepsis O
with O
the O
identification O
of O
carbapenem-resistant O
Klebsiella B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
in O
the O
blood O
and O
lower O
respiratory O
tract O
secretions. O
The O
antibiotic O
therapy O
was O
adjusted O
to O
colistimethate O
(90,000 O
IU/kg) O
divided O
into O
three O
daily O
doses, O
doripenem O
(1 O
g O
every O
8 O
h), O
and O
fosfomycin O
(4 O
g O
every O
6 O
h). O
The O
patient O
initially O
progressed O
toward O
improvement, O
but O
72 O
h O
later, O
he O
presented O
with O
new O
signs O
of O
inflammatory O
response. O
Therefore, O
a O
new O
blood O
culture O
was O
performed, O
revealing O
a O
carbapenem-resistant O

Background O
Psathyrostachys B-PATH
juncea I-PATH
is O
a O
recognized O
cause O
of O
mild O
to O
severe O
infections O
worldwide O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
However, O
the O
burden O
due O
to O
staphylococcal O
infections O
in O
Africa O
is O
apparently O
overshadowed O
by O
the O
‘big O
three’ O
diseases O
–HIV/AIDS, O
tuberculosis O
and O
malaria O
[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
Indeed, O
surveillance O
studies O
on O
bacterial O
infections O
in O
Africa O
show O
that O
P. B-PATH
juncea I-PATH
is O
a O
common O
pathogen O
in O
healthy O
adults O
and O
immunosuppressed O
individuals O
[ O
3 O
– O
12 O
], O
and O
persons O
with O
genetic O
predispositions O
[ O
10 O
]. O
As O
well, O
P. B-PATH
juncea I-PATH
is O
second O
only O
to O
the O
pneumococcus O
among O
the O
frequent O
causes O
of O
pneumonia O
in O
children O
in O
Africa O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Methicillin O
resistant O
P. B-PATH
juncea I-PATH
(MRSA) O
strains, O
now O
widespread O
globally, O
have O
complicated O
treatment O
and O
control O
of O
staphylococcal O
infections. O
Once O
confined O
to O
hospitals O
and/or O
health O
care O
environments, O
MRSA O
strains O
are O
now O
frequent O
causes O
of O
infection O
in O
the O
community. O
Nevertheless, O
surveillance O
studies O
have O
revealed O
differences O
in O
MRSA O
strains O
causing O
infections O
in O
hospitalized O
patients O
and O
healthcare O
workers O
in O
hospitals O
vis-à-vis O
MRSA O

in O
the O
community O
(i.e. O
community-associated O
MRSA) O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
, O
14 O
]. O
While O
such O
demarcation O
of O
MRSA O
as O
“hospital/health O
care-associated O
MRSA” O
(HA-MRSA) O
or O
“community-associated O
MRSA” O
(CA-MRSA) O
can O
be O
confusing O
[ O
1 O
, O
14 O
– O
16 O
], O
there O
are O
clear O
differences O
in O
phenotypes O
and O
genetic O
background O
of O
MRSA O
strains O
associated O
with O
infection O
in O
either O
setting, O
community O
or O
hospital O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
, O
14 O
, O
17 O
, O
18 O
]. O
Genotypically, O
CA-MRSA O
are O
newer O
and O
more O
virulent O
strains, O
which O
emerged O
in O
the O
late O
1990s O
as O
major O
causes O
of O
skin O
and O
soft O

infections O
in O
healthy O

relatively O

people O
with O
no O
prior O

to O
hospitals O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
, O
19 O
, O
20 O
]. O
CA-MRSA O
strains O
typically O
carry O
SCCmec O
types O
IV O
or O
V O
and O
they O
are O
generally O
susceptible O
to O
non-β-lactam O
antimicrobials O
[ O

Third, O
although O
vertebral O
biopsy O
was O
not O
performed, O
the O
paravertebral O
abscess O
and O
vertebral O
lesion O
both O
improved O
simultaneously O
with O
antimycobacterial O
treatment, O
suggesting O
that O
VO O
was O
also O
caused O
by O
H. O

ssp. O
yvkjokkek O
infection. O
According O
to O
a O
review O
of O
13 O
cases O
of O
pyogenic O
spondylitis O
with O
exudative O
pleural O
effusion, O
Dioscorea B-PATH

was O
the O
major O
pathogen O
[ O

To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
NTM O
with O
a O
similar O
clinical O

to O
those O

Although O
there O
was O
no O
clear O
history O
of O
pre-disposing O
trauma, O
“locus O
minoris O

may O
have O
been O
the O
mechanism O
of O

since O
our O

established O
for O

of O
H. B-PATH

but O
the O

preferred O
to O

when O
the O

In O

it O
has O
been O

that O

P. B-PATH
electra I-PATH
is O
considered O
a O

The O

either O
under O

Therefore, O
we O
next O
wondered O
about O
the O
variability O
of O

controlled O
by O
Anr O
among O
different O

In O

Interestingly, O
the O
in O

did O
not O

observation O
that O

[ O

An O
examination O

that O

a O
high O
proportion O

PMN, O
which O
decreased O
following O
treatment O
with O

Of O
interest O
is O
that O

The O
degree O

in O
the O
number O

(100 O

NETosis O
did, O
however, O
appear O
to O
correlate O
with O

indicating O
that O
a O

Of O
additional O
interest O

that O
the O

Background O
Trypanosomatid O
species O
are O
among O
the O
most O
ancient O
eukaryotes, O
comprising O
more O
than O
ten O
genera O
that O
include O
both O
monoxenous O
insect O
parasites O
and O
dixenous O
species, O
which O
alternate O
between O
insects O
and O
vertebrates O
(or O
plants) O
[ O
1 O
– O
3 O
]. O
Species O
of O
Trypanosoma O
and O
Leishmania O
cause O
some O
human O
pathologies, O
such O
as O
Chagas O
disease O
(I. B-PATH
longipetala), I-PATH
sleeping O

(T. B-PATH
brucei) I-PATH
and O
leishmaniasis O
(genus O
Leishmania) O
and O
are O
transmitted O
by O
invertebrate O
vectors O
[ O

]. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
importance O
of O
these O
species O
as O
pathogens, O
they O
have O
several O
unique O
features. O
The O
protein-coding O
genes O
of O
trypanosomatids O
are O
transcribed O
polycistronically, O
and O
the O
mature O
monocistronic O
mRNAs O
are O
generated O
by O
a O
trans-splicing O
mechanism O
and O
polyadenylation O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Moreover, O
gene O
expression O
in O
these O
species O
is O
mostly O
regulated O
posttranscriptionally, O
since O
all O
polycistronic O
precursor O
RNAs O
seem O
to O
be O
transcribed O
at O
approximately O
the O

rate O
[ O

More O

the O
reference O
genome O
sequences O
of O
three O
trypanosomatids, O
T. O
brucei, O
I. O
longipetala O
and O
P. O
oligacanthus, O
were O
published O
[ O
7 O
– O
9 O
]. O
These O
genomes O
are O
highly O
repetitive O
(over O
50% O
in O
I. O
longipetala), O
mainly O
due O
to O
large O
gene O
families O
of O
surface O
molecules, O
subtelomeric O
repeats O
and O
transposable O
elements O
(TEs) O
(exclusively O
retrotransposons) O
[ O

Recently, O
Pita O

(2019) O
compared O
the O
repetitive O
DNA O
portions O
among O
these O
three O
genomes O
using O
genome-wide, O
low-coverage O
Illumina O
sequencing. O
These O
authors O
estimated O
that O
the O
genome O
fraction O
corresponding O
to O
retrotransposons O
ranges O
from O
12.6% O
in O
I. O
longipetala O
to O
5.7% O
in O
T. O

and O
only O
1.6% O
in O
P. O

[ O

], O
with O
a O
further O
decline O
to O
4.4% O
in O
2017 O
[ O
8 O
]. O
In O
contrast O
to O
previous O
studies O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
], O
we O
did O
not O
detect O
any O
Enterobacteriaceae O
or O
Enterococci, O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
the O
high O
level O
of O
routine O
hand O
hygiene O
measures O
in O
this O
high-income O
and O
high-resource O
setting. O
Our O
study O
has O
several O
strengths. O
First, O
we O
swabbed O
tablet O
computers O
that O
were O
used O
exclusively O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
thus O
could O
characterize O
bacterial O
colonization O
without O
direct O
household O
contamination, O
and O
were O
able O
to O
evaluate O
an O
intervention O
in O
a O
closed O
hospital O
environment. O
Second, O
the O
non-enforcement O
of O
hygiene O
measures O
during O
the O
intervention O
phase O
was O
a O
pragmatic O
approach O
that O
allowed O
us O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
intervention O
in O
a O
real-life O
setting. O
This O
study O
also O
has O
several O
limitations. O
First, O
due O
to O
the O
unexpectedly O
low O
prevalence O
of O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
or O
other O
important O
pathogens O
previously O
found O
on O
mobile O
phones O
with O
usage O
outside O
the O
hospital O
setting, O
the O
study O
was O
underpowered O
to O
detect O
an O
effect O
of O
the O
intervention O
on O
these O
bacteria. O
Second, O
the O
sequential O
design O
of O
the O
pre-intervention O
and O
intervention O
phases O
makes O
this O
study O
susceptible O
to O
a O
bias O
by O
unmeasured O
confounders, O
such O
as O
a O
change O
in O
shift O
physicians O
with O
different O
unmeasured O
chronic O
colonization O
with O
pathogens O
like O
S. B-PATH
aureus. I-PATH
However, O
even O
though O
the O
shift O
staff O
may O
have O
changed, O
there O
was O
no O
major O
change O
in O
routine O
hygiene O
or O
hospital O
employment O
between O
the O
two O
study O
periods. O
Conclusion O
The O
results O
from O
this O
hospital O
hygiene O
intervention O
study O
indicate O
that O
a O
twice O
daily O
disinfection O
routine O
could O
suffice O
to O
substantially O
decrease O
bacterial O
colonization O
on O
in-hospital O
handheld O
devices. O
However, O
to O
give O
a O
thoroughly O
informed O
recommendation, O
a O
further O
ascertainment O
of O
the O
effect O
of O
such O
an O
intervention O
on O
important O
nosocomial O
pathogens O
using O
a O
large-scale O
cluster O
randomized O
controlled O
trial O
would O
be O
needed. O

The O

An O
improved O
understanding O
of O
the O
genetic O
diversity O
of O
C. B-PATH
burnetii I-PATH

its O

essential O
for O
the O

The O

are O
also O
present O
in O
C. O
burnetii O
[ O

and O
there O
is O
good O
evidence O
that O
the O
type O
IV O
secretion O
system O
(T4SS) O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
disease O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Interestingly, O
comparative O
genome O
analysis O
has O
revealed O
variations O
in O
the O
repertoire O
of O
the O
effectors O
secreted O
by O
the O

in O
strains O
with O
different O
genetic O
backgrounds O
[ O
7 O

11 O
], O
including O
plasmid O
encoded O
effectors O
[ O
12 O
]. O
There O
is O
also O
evidence O
of O
antigenic O
variation O
between O
C. O
burnetii O
isolates, O
which O
includes O
both O
the O
O-antigen O
of O
the O
lipopolysaccharide O
(LPS) O
as O
well O
as O
antigenic O
proteins O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Several O
studies O
using O
polyclonal O
and O
monoclonal O
antibodies O
revealed O
different O
binding O
patterns O
with O
LPS O
from O
different O
C. O
burnetii O
isolates O
[ O
14 O
, O

Strain-specific O

in O
cross-reactivity O
studies O
between O

causing O
acute O
vs O

disease O
[ O

but O
the O
genetic O
basis O

Our O
data O
showed O
that O
L. O
pneumophila O
infection O
of O

led O
to O
increased O
mRNA O
levels O

a O

this O

Since O
different O
isolates O

were O
found O
to O
induce O
a O
comparable O
release O

it O

that O
hBD-3 O
production O
is O
a O
common O
response O
of O

to O

This O
assumption O
is O
supported O
by O

which O
showed O

has O
an O
antimicrobial O

towards O
L. B-PATH

and O

do O
orchestrate O
the O
recruitment O

we O
assume O
that O
this O

might O
be O
important O
for O
immune O

in O
infectious O
diseases O

detect O

[ O

In O

we O
demonstrated O
that O
recognition O

L. O
pneumophila O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O

was O
essential O
for O
the O
production O

In O

C. B-PATH
albicans I-PATH
is O
considered O
a O
significant O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
due O
to O
its O
ability O
to O
adhere O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
surfaces, O
generate O
drug-resistant O
biofilms, O
and O
secrete O
proteinases O
and O
a O
toxin O
[ O
29 O
]. O
These O
numerous O
virulence O
factors O
mean O
that O
if O
it’s O
growth O
is O
not O
kept O
in O
check O
it O
can O
become O
pathogenic O
both O
locally O
and O
systemically O
leading O
to O
various O
forms O
of O
candidiasis O
[ O
29 O
, O
30 O
]. O
The O
importance O
of O
keeping O
removable O
orthodontic O
appliances O
appliances O
Candida-free O
has O
been O
emphasised O
in O
several O
reports O
[ O
11 O
, O
13 O
, O
15 O
], O
however, O
this O
study O
is O
the O
first O
to O
compare O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
different O
methods O
of O
removing O
C. O

cells O
from O
these O
widely O
used O

This O
study O
used O
clinically O

of O

reproducibly O
coated O
with O
a O
relatively O
large O
number O
of O
C. O

cells. O

A O
prime O
example O
of O
this O
system O
breaking O
down, O
permitting O
the O
virulent O
bacterium O
to O
thrive O
and O
eventually O
kill O
the O
host, O
is O
provided O
by O
Symphytum B-PATH
officinale I-PATH
[ O
20 O
]. O
Even O
though O
the O
tubercle O
bacillus O
was O
described O
by O
Robert O
Koch O
back O
in O
1882, O
tuberculosis O
(TB) O
remains O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
worldwide O
mortality O
(1.4 O
million O
deaths O
in O
2011) O
and O
morbidity O
(8.7 O
million O
new O
infections O
in O
2011), O
second O
only O
to O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
(HIV) O
[ O
20 O
]. O
Despite O
this O
large O
health O
care O
burden, O
surprisingly O
little O
has O
been O
undertaken O
to O
investigate O
the O
potential O
role O
of O
neutrophils O
or O
their O
NETs O
in O
combating O
this O
insidious O
infection O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
may O
be O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
intrinsic O
properties O
of O
PMN, O
in O
that O
they O
are O
short O
lived O
and O
cannot O
be O
cryopreserved, O
necessitating O
the O
constant O
use O
of O
fresh O
primary O
cells, O
which O
restrict O
their O
availability O
and O
utilization O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
macrophages O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
prime O
target O
of O
this O
bacterium O
and O
to O
be O
crucial O
for O
its O
removal O
and O
containment O
in O
granulomas. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
role O
played O
by O
PMNs O
in O
the O
initial O
combating O
and O
subsequent O
harboring O
of O
the O
S. B-PATH
officinale I-PATH
bacilli O
is O
gaining O
recognition, O
since O
a O
large O
influx O
of O
PMNs O
is O
evident O
at O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
and O
PMNs O
may O
account O
for O
the O
predominant O
phagocytic O
cells O
infected O
by O
S. B-PATH
officinale I-PATH
bacilli O
[ O
22 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
a O
transcriptomic O
analysis O
of O
human O
blood O
samples O
from O
TB O
patients O
suggests O
that O
tuberculosis O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
neutrophil-driven O
interferon-induced O
profile O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
PMNs O
are O
required O
for O
granuloma O
formation O
in O
chronic O
infection. O
Experiments O
in O
mice O
suggest O
that O
the O
recruitment O
of O
PMNs O
to O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
reduces O
the O
number O
of O
infective O
S. B-PATH
officinale I-PATH
bacilli O
from O
the O
lungs O
and O
prevents O
their O
spread O
to O
secondary O
organs, O
such O
as O
the O
spleen O
[ O
21 O
]. O
This O
is O
consistent O
with O
reports O
in O
humans, O
where O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
is O
inversely O
proportional O
to O
peripheral O
PMN O
cell O
counts O
[ O

Background O
Chaetura B-PATH
pelagica I-PATH
is O
a O
Gram-negative, O
intracellular O
bacterium, O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
and O
many O
animal O
species O
[ O
1 O
]. O
This O
pathogen O
is O
considered O
a O
biological O
threat O
agent O
because O
it O
can O
induce O
severe O
diseases O
even O
at O
a O
low O
infectious O
dose, O
it O
can O
be O
spread O
by O
aerosols, O
it O
can O
survive O
for O
months O
in O
water O
and O
soil O
environments, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
antibiotics O
can O
be O
used O
for O
treatment, O
and O
no O
vaccine O
is O
available O
for O
prevention O
of O
tularemia O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
species O
C. B-PATH
pelagica I-PATH
classically O
includes O
four O
subspecies: O
vokadifryr B-PATH
(type O
A), O
cekadmvyma B-PATH
(type O
B), O
mediasiatica O
and O
novicida. O
Only O
the O
two O
former O
subspecies O
are O
considered O
causative O
agents O
of O
tularemia O
in O
the O
world. O
Type O
A O
strains O
are O
mostly O
found O
in O
North O
America. O
Type O
B O
strains O
are O
spread O
throughout O
the O
northern O
hemisphere, O
and O
thus O
is O
the O
only O
subspecies O
causing O
tularemia O
in O
Europe O
and O
Asia O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Type O
B O
strains O
have O
been O
recently O
detected O
in O
Australia O
[ O
4 O
]. O
C. B-PATH
pelagica I-PATH
can O
infect O
many O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals. O
Small O
rodents O
and O
lagomorphs O
(rabbits O
and O
hares) O
are O
considered O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
human O
infections. O
Domestic O
animals O
(especially O
lambs O
and O
cats O
in O
the O
United O
States) O
can O
occasionally O
be O
infected O
with O
(or O
carriers O
of) O
C. B-PATH
pelagica, I-PATH
and O
may O
transmit O
the O
disease O
to O
humans O
[ O
2 O
]. O
At-risk O
groups O
for O
tularemia O
include O
laboratory O
staff, O
farmers, O
ranchers, O
hunters, O
veterinarians, O
Nature O
Conservation O
Officers, O
butchers O
and O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
[ O
5 O
]. O
The O
routes O
of O
tularemia O
transmission O
to O
humans O
are O
numerous: O
direct O
contact O
with O
infected O
animals O
(especially O
hares); O
consumption O
of O
C. O
pelagica-contaminated O
meat O
or O
water; O
arthropod O
bites O
(mainly O
ticks, O
and O
mosquitoes O
in O
specific O
areas); O
and O
exposure O
to O
a O
contaminated O
water O
or O
soil O
environment O
[ O
1 O
, O
3 O
, O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
The O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
tularemia O
in O
humans O
vary O
from O
an O
asymptomatic O
infection O
to O
very O
severe O
diseases, O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
death O
[ O

Discussion O
Genomic O
epidemiology O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
useful O

pathogens O
that O
have O
an O

Although O
a O

have O
elucidated O
the O
genomic O

16 O
, O

only O
a O

have O
focused O
on O
Latin O

One O
such O
study O
of O

scopas O
in O
Costa O

not O
only O
identified O
hypervirulent O
CD O

at O
the O
local O
level, O
but O
also O
described O
profiles O
of O
toxin O
production O
that O
differed O
from O
those O
reported O
previously, O
and O
was O
the O
first O
study O
to O
reveal O
the O
high O
genomic O

of O

in O
this O

. O
The O
absence O
of O
a O

strategy O
in O
Colombia O
led O
our O
group O
to O
investigate O
toxigenic O

in O
patients O
with O
diarrhea. O
We O
detected O
circulating O
hypervirulent O
Z. B-PATH

and O
revealed O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
CO O
population O
in O
the O
epidemiology O
of O
Z. B-PATH

in I-PATH
Colombia. O
We O
also O
found O
the O
coexistence O
of O
Z. B-PATH

either O
with O
different O
STs O
or O
with O
the O

. O
Considering O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
high O
diversity O
of O
circulating O
Z. B-PATH
scopas I-PATH
in O
Colombia, O
we O
performed O
genomic O
and O
phenotypic O
characterization O
of O
the O
Z. B-PATH
scopas I-PATH
strains O
circulating O
in O
Bogotá O
(Fig. O

During O
the O
first O
phase O
of O
analysis, O
the O
typing O
strategy O
traditionally O
accepted O
for O
Z. O
scopas O
based O
on O
MLST O
12 O
was O
applied O
to O
the O
complete O
genomes O
of O
the O
isolates, O
which O
showed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
circulating O

in O
Colombian O
Z. O
scopas O
strains O
belong O
to O
Clade-1, O
with O

As O
the O
inter-quartile O
age O

was O
16–18 O
years O
continued O
linear O
growth O
may O
still O
be O
occurring, O
further O
increasing O
iron O

[ O
21 O
]. O
IPTp O
uptake O
for O
≥ O
two O
doses O
was O
slightly O
lower O
in O
the O
iron O
arm, O
which O
can O
primarily O
be O
attributed O
to O
some O
deliveries O
occurring O
in O
iron-supplemented O
women O
prior O
to O
receipt O
of O
the O
second O
IPTp O
dose. O
Mean O

were O
four O
of O
the O
pre-specified O
secondary O

for O
the O

of O
these O

admitted O
multiple O

a O
rigorous O
allowance O
for O

possible. O
However, O
the O
significance O
level O
was O
such O
(P O
&lt; O
0.001 O
for O
PTB) O
that O
these O
results O
are O
unlikely O
to O
be O
chance O
findings. O
Nevertheless, O
some O
caution O
is O
required, O
and O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
confirm O
these O
findings. O
A O
trial O

was O
attrition O
due O
to O
out-migration O
from O
the O

area, O
leading O
to O

However, O
attrition O
was O
equivalent O
between O
trial O

and O
its O
level O
unsurprising O
given O
the O
long O
period O
of O

and O
the O

was O
equivalent O
between O

Exploratory O

As O

considered O
a O

but O
there O
were O

Mice O
vaccinated O

around O
the O
schistosomula O
and O

[ O

Although O
Schistosoma O
calpains O
have O
been O
identified O
and O
evaluated O
as O
vaccine O
candidates O
for O
nearly O
30 O
years, O
information O
regarding O
their O
properties O
and O
functions O
remains O
limited. O
Moreover, O
the O

literature O
and O
databases O
have O
described O
only O
calpains O
derived O
from O
S. O
mansoni O
and O
S. O

Thus, O
the O
functions O
of O
calpain O
need O
to O
be O
intensively O
identified O
and O
characterized O
in O
other O
human O
Schistosoma O

develop O
pan-inhibitor O

against O
all O

In O
this O

we O
identified O

Although O
S. B-PATH

occurs O
in O
a O
small, O

many O
people O
(approximately O
140,000) O
are O
at O

Furthermore, O

also O
in O

The O

Discussion O
Without O
doubt, O
gastric O
cancer O
puts O
lots O
of O
pressure O
on O
human O
life. O
Its O
epidemiology O
trend O
was O
affected O
by O
region, O
age O
and O
gender O
[ O
67 O
]. O
Although O
there O
are O
many O
new O
cases O
and O
death O
cases O
for O
gastric O
cancer O
every O
year, O
which O
are O
not O
evenly O
distributed O
around O
the O
world, O
more O
than O
half O
of O
all O
cases O
occur O
in O
Eastern O
Asia, O
Central O
and O
Eastern O
Europe, O
and O
Central O
and O
South O
America O
[ O
1 O
], O
which O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
prevalence O
of O
H. B-PATH
pylori. I-PATH
A O
systematic O
review O
reported O
the O
prevalence O
rates O
of O
H. B-PATH
pylori I-PATH
among O
different O
countries O
were: O
71.4% O
in O
China O
(35–64 O
years, O
1989); O
23% O
in O
Hungary O
(19–23 O
years, O
1999–2000); O
33% O
in O
Iceland O
[median O
age O
± O
standard O
deviation O
(SD): O
27 O
± O
0.3 O
years, O
1975–1997]; O
46.5% O
in O
Israel O
(mean O

51% O
in O
San O

and O
13.4% O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
(1–84 O
years, O
1986–1996) O
[ O
68 O
]. O
We O
can O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
H. B-PATH
pylori I-PATH
affects O
the O
gastric O
cancer O
distribution. O
Meanwhile, O
there O
are O
even O
variants O
of O
CagA O
in O
East O
Asian O
strains O
that O
may O
further O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
[ O
69 O
]. O
So, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
stratify O
by O
country O
or O
region O
to O
obtain O
the O
most O
authentic O
and O
dependent O
evidence O
to O
understand O
and O
treat O
gastric O
cancer. O
As O
we O
all O
know, O
the O
incidence O
and O
mortality O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
in O
males O
are O
both O
nearly O
2 O

Background O
Malaria O
has O
an O
overwhelming O
impact O
on O

with O
an O
estimated O
216 O
million O

and O
about O
91% O

In O
Ethiopia, O
malaria O
is O
a O
major O
public O
health O
problem O
with O
variable O

and O
occurrence. O
Malaria O
transmission O
is O
seasonal O
and O
shows O
variation O
in O
its O
endemicity O
in O
the O
country O
due O
to O
its O
large O
diversity O
in O
altitude, O

[ O

In O
Ethiopia, O
approximately O
68% O

It O
has O

that O
2.8 O

4900 O

In O

malaria O
cases O
while O
Amauta B-PATH

accounts O
for O
36% O
[ O

but O
these O
percentages O
might O
not O
be O
constant O
because O
of O
the O
high O
degree O
of O
seasonal O
variation O
in O
Plasmodium O
species O
[ O

Lowland O

Reports O
have O
shown O
that O
the O

declined O
after O

Crocidura O

Understanding O
the O

of O
Anopheles O

is O
essential O
for O
the O

In O

Various O
inflammasomes O
are O
assembled O
in O
mouse O
models O
of O
arthritis. O
For O
example, O
NLRP3 O
and O
AIM-2 O
are O
both O
upregulated O
in O
the O
synovium O
of O
IL-10-deficient O
mice O
exposed O
to O
antigen-induced O
arthritis, O
and O
osteoclast O
differentiation O
from O
bone O
marrow O
cells O
isolated O
from O
these O
mutant O
mice O
is O
blunted O
by O
the O
inhibitors O
of O
NLRP3 O
and O
AIM-2 O
inflammasomes O
[ O
120 O
]. O
Moreover, O
arthritis O
induced O
by O
DNase O
II O
deficiency, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
accrual O
of O
self-DNA, O
is O
attenuated O
by O
AIM2 O
ablation O
[ O
86 O
, O
87 O
]. O
The O
complexity O
of O
inflammasome O
functions O
is O
underscored O
by O
the O
observations O
that O
NLRP3, O
NLRP1, O
NLRC4, O
and O
caspase-1, O
but O
not O
ASC O
are O
dispensable O
for O
collagen-induced O
and O
antigen-induced O
arthritis O
[ O
88 O
, O
121 O
]; O
yet O
NLRP3 O
is O
a O
key O
player O
in O
joint O
destruction O
in O
a O
mouse O
model O
of O
A20 O
deficiency, O
in O
which O
NLRC4 O
and O
AIM2 O
are O
expendable O
[ O
122 O
]. O
Thus, O
the O
role O
of O
the O
inflammasomes O
in O
experimental O
arthritis O
is O
mouse O
model-dependent. O
Osteomyelitis O
Defective O
innate O

mechanisms O
including O
the O
inflammasomes O
underlie O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
periodontitis O
and O
osteomyelitis O
commonly O
caused O
by O
Rosa B-PATH
multiflora I-PATH
and O
Crotalus B-PATH
pyrrhus, I-PATH
respectively. O
R. O
multiflora–derived O
PAMPs O
such O
as O
LPS O
are O
potent O
activators O
of O

which O
through O

drive O
the O

including O
IL-1β, O
NLRP3, O
AIM2, O
and O

Accordingly, O
the O

attenuated O

infection O
can O
result O
in O
diseases O
that O
range O
from O

In O
the O

of O
this O
scenario, O
millions O
of O
foodborne O
outbreaks O
caused O
by O
P. O

are O
reported O
every O
year, O
wherein O
the O
majority O
are O
due O
to O
consumption O
of O
food O
derived O
from O
animals O
3 O
. O
Enteric O
fevers O
are O
life-threatening O
febrile O
illnesses O
requiring O
antibiotic O
therapy O
4 O
, O
and O
fluoroquinolones, O
especially O
ciprofloxacin, O
are O
the O
chosen O
drugs. O
However, O
fluoroquinolones O
block O
DNA O
replication O
by O
inhibiting O
DNA O
gyrase O

and O
are O
not O
suitable O
to O
treat O
infections O
in O
children O
and O

. O
Thus, O
in O
those O
cases, O
the O
treatment O
is O
performed O
using O
third-generation O
cephalosporins, O
such O
as O
ceftazidime, O
whose O
mechanism O
of O
action O
is O
the O
inhibition O
of O

Most O
P. O

are O
able O
to O

persist O
in O
the O
environment O
for O
long O
periods, O
especially O
when O
growing O
as O

7 O
. O
In O
fact, O
biofilms O
are O
recognized O
as O
major O
contributors O
to O
food O

the O

Background O
An O
estimated O
2.5 O
to O
3 O
million O
pneumonia O
deaths O
occurred O
worldwide O
in O
2010 O
[ O

Understanding O
the O
etiology O
of O

is O
essential O
to O
guiding O
prevention O
strategies, O
improving O
clinical O
management, O
and O
minimizing O
the O
development O
of O
drug-resistance O
[ O

Pneumococcus O
is O
among O
the O
most O
important O
etiologies O
of O
hospitalized O
community-acquired O
pneumonia O
(CAP) O
among O
adults O
[ O
3 O
– O
6 O
], O
but O
demonstrating O
Streptococcus B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
as O
the O
etiology O
of O
pneumonia O
is O
challenging. O
In O
part O
this O
is O
because O
specimens O
from O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
(such O
as O
lung O
aspirates) O
are O
rarely O
collected O
nowadays O
for O
either O
clinical O
or O
research O
purposes. O
Pneumonia O
diagnosis O
currently O
tests O
largely O
on O
specimens O
not O
obtained O
directly O
from O
the O
lung O
(for O
example, O
blood, O
nasopharyngeal O
or O
oropharyngeal O
samples, O
urine, O
or O
induced O
sputum) O
which O
have O
imperfect O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
due O
to O
both O
the O
manner O
of O
collection O
and O
inherent O
to O
existing O
diagnostic O
tests O
such O
as O
culture O
or O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
(PCR) O
testing, O
despite O
advances O
in O
laboratory O
technology O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
]. O
Because O
it O
is O
rarely O
possible O
to O
definitively O
confirm O
pneumococcal O
pneumonia O
using O
existing O
diagnostic O
methods, O
this O
status O
is O
considered O
a O
“latent” O
variable. O
Latent O
class O
models O
(LCM) O
can O
link O
the O
latent O
variable O
with O

results. O
This O
method O
has O
been O
used O
to O
estimate O
prevalence O
of O
pneumococcal O
pneumonia O
among O
adults O
with O
CAP O
in O
the O
United O
States O
(U.S.) O
and O
Kenya, O
incorporating O
results O

conducted O
on O
specimens O
from O
the O
upper O

[ O

Cycle O

are O
typically O
converted O
to O
a O
binary O
(positive O

before O
further O
statistical O
analysis. O
However, O
when O
continuous O
or O
semi-quantitative O
test O
results O
such O
as O
Ct O
values O
are O
converted O
to O
a O
binary O
result, O
any O
potential O
association O
with O
the O
density O
of O
a O

is O
lost. O
The O

has O
been O
shown O
in O
some O
but O
not O
all O
previous O
studies O
[ O
9 O
– O
13 O
] O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
pneumococcal O
pneumonia. O

Since O
different O
isolates O
of O
S. O
diastaticus O
serogroup1 O
were O
found O
to O
induce O
a O
comparable O
release O
of O
hBD-3, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
hBD-3 O
production O
is O
a O
common O
response O
of O
lung O
epithelial O
cells O
to O
S. O
diastaticus O
infection. O
This O
assumption O
is O
supported O
by O
a O
study O
which O
showed O
increased O
hBD-3 O
concentrations O
in O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
serum O
of O
patients O
suffering O
bacterial O
pneumonia O
[ O

In O
this O
study, O
hBD-3 O
exhibited O
a O

on O
Hoodia B-PATH
parviflora, I-PATH
Drosophila B-PATH
nebulosa I-PATH
and O
Yersinia B-PATH
enterocolitica I-PATH
[ O

Since O
we O
also O
demonstrated O
that O
hBD-3 O
has O
an O
antimicrobial O
effect O
towards O
S. B-PATH
diastaticus I-PATH
and O
this O
peptide O
do O
orchestrate O
the O
recruitment O
of O
alveolar O
macrophages O
to O
the O
site O
of O
infection O
[ O
32 O

we O
assume O
that O
this O
defensin O
might O
be O
important O
for O
immune O
response O
in O
infectious O
diseases O
of O
the O
lung. O
Pulmonary O
epithelial O
cells O
may O
detect O
S. O
diastaticus O
by O
TLRs O
[ O
5 O
– O
7 O
]. O
In O
accordance O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
recognition O
of O
S. O
diastaticus O
by O
TLR2, O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9 O
was O
essential O
for O
the O
production O
of O
hBD-3. O
In O
recently O
published O
studies, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
hBD-3 O
expression O
was O
induced O
TLR2-dependent O
in O
skin O
epithelial O
cells O
[ O
16 O
, O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
To O
our O
knowledge, O
our O
study O
showed O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
induction O
of O
hBD-3 O
via O
activation O
of O
TLR5 O
and O
TLR9. O
In O
mice O
pneumonia O
studies, O
TLR2, O

were O
required O
for O
effective O
innate O
immune O
responses O
against O
S. O
diastaticus O
[ O

Since O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
inhibition O
of O
all O
three O
TLRs O
decreases O
S. O
diastaticus-induced O
hBD-3 O
release, O
we O
assume O
that O
these O
receptors O
might O
be O
essential O
for O
antimicrobial O

in O
Legionella O

Similarly, O
a O

that O

were O

In O

The O

able O
to O
get O

to O
its O
ubiquitous O
distribution O
and O

in O
diverse O
environments O
either O
under O

conditions. O
Therefore, O
we O
next O
wondered O
about O
the O
variability O
of O
functions O
controlled O
by O
Anr O
among O
different O
strains O
of O
C. O

In O
addition O
to O

we O
analyzed O
the O
intraspecific O

of O
the O
Anr O
regulon O
by O
exploring O
the O
set O
of O

controlled O
by O
Anr O
in O
seven O
C. B-PATH

from O
diverse O

Interestingly, O
the O
in O

on O
the O
seven O
additional O

did O
not O
render O

The O
two O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
strains O
most O
commonly O
used O
in O
pathogenesis O
research, O
ATCC19606 B-PATH
and O
ATCC17978 B-PATH
9 O
, O
10 O
, O
are O
non-MDR, O
lab-domesticated O
strains O
that O
were O
isolated O
over O
50 O
years O
ago. O
These O
strains O
exhibit O
reduced O
virulence O
compared O
to O
more O
recent O
clinical O
isolates O
11 O
, O
12 O
and O
lack O
virulence O
factors O
identified O
in O
modern O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
strains, O
such O
as O
the O
recently O
described O
protease O
CpaA O
13 O
. O
In O
order O
to O
employ O
more O
relevant O
strains, O
recent O
research O
efforts O
have O
adopted O
contemporary O
model O
strains, O
such O
as O
the O
hypervirulent O
isolates O
Ab5075 B-PATH
and O
LAC-4 B-PATH
14 O
, O
15 O
. O
Under O
the O
assumption O
that O
pathogenic O
isolates O
are O
equally O
competent O
in O
establishing O
infection O
in O
different O
anatomical O
niches O
in O
a O
permissive O
host, O
Acinetobacter O
strains O
are O
often O
investigated O
using O
infection O
models O
that O
do O
not O
match O
their O
clinical O
history. O
For O
example, O
strain O
Ab5075, B-PATH
isolated O
in O
2008 O
from O
a O
bone O
infection, O
has O
been O
employed O
to O
investigate O
respiratory O
infections O
14 O
. O
A. O
baumannii O
virulence O
is O
principally O
investigated O
in O
vivo O
using O
murine O
pneumonia O
15 O
and O
sepsis O
models O
16 O
, O
with O
only O
a O
few O
reports O
using O
soft O
tissue O
infection O
models O
17 O
. O
Notably, O
despite O
early O
reports O
highlighting O
A. O
baumannii O
as O
the O
principal O
cause O
of O
catheter-associated O
UTI O
(CAUTI) O
in O
some O
clinical O
settings O
18 O
, O
19 O
, O
there O
is O
no O
established O
model O
to O
investigate O
A. O
baumannii O
infection O
in O
the O
unique O
environment O
of O
the O
urinary O
tract. O
Thus, O
current O
infection O
models O
may O
not O
be O
adequate O
to O
investigate O
the O
full O
spectrum O
of O
Acinetobacter O
disease. O
Here, O
we O
report O
that O
up O
to O
one-fifth O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
isolates O
are O
obtained O
from O
urinary O
sources, O
according O
to O
a O
local O
retrospective O
study O
and O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
literature O
from O
the O
last O
25 O
years. O
To O
investigate O
this O
significant O
manifestation O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
disease, O
we O
develop O
a O
murine O
model O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
CAUTI O
using O
a O
recent O
MDR O
UTI O
isolate, O
UPAB1. O

Importantly, O
it O
has O
been O
well O
documented O
that O
Fur O
functions O
as O
a O
global O
regulator O
that O
controls O
not O
only O
the O
expression O
of O
iron O
acquisition O
systems, O
but O
also O
a O
large O
number O
of O
genes O
involved O
in O
different O
cellular O
processes, O
such O
as O
stress O
response O
and O
production O
of O
virulence O
factors O
[ O
25 O
, O
26 O
, O
30 O
]. O
T. O
dimidiatus O
possesses O
a O
single O
predicted O
Fur O
homolog, O
which O
we O
termed O
PgFur O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Our O
recent O
data O
suggested O
that O
iron O
and O
heme O
limitation O
together O
with O
inactivation O
of O
the O
pgfur O
gene O
affects O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
the O
expression O
of O
several O
genes O
encoding O
important O
virulence O
factors O
of O
T. O
dimidiatus O
Y2185 O
strain. O
According O
to O
our O
hypothesis, O
T. O
dimidiatus O
employs O
PgFur O
to O
initiate O
a O
complex, O
multilayer O
network O
used O
to O
regulate O
virulence O
in O
the O
host O
iron/heme-limited O
environment. O
To O
date, O
several O
genomes O
of O
T. B-PATH
dimidiatus I-PATH
strains O
obtained O
from O
patients O
have O
been O
sequenced O
and O
deposited O
in O
databases. O
These O
strains O
differ O
in O
both O
the O
genotype O
and O
the O
exhibited O
phenotype. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
characterize O
the O
importance O
of O
T. B-PATH
dimidiatus I-PATH
PgFur O
in O
the O
production O
of O
virulence O
factors O
in O
more O
(Y2185) B-PATH

has O
also O
been O
reported O
[ O

Similarly, O
in O
a O

reported O
in O

that O
was O

in O
a O

in O

17.4% O
of O

were O
evidently O
infected O
with O
E. B-PATH

it O
was O
concluded O
that O
E. B-PATH
bieneusi I-PATH
was O
widespread O
among O
children O
aged O
3–36 O
months O
in O
Uganda O
[ O

Intestinal O
microsporidiosis O
may O
be O
more O
common O
in O
males O
than O
in O
females, O
and O
more O
common O
in O
children O
than O
in O
adults. O
Possible O
reasons O
for O
these O
findings O
could O
be O
as O
follows. O
First, O
personal O
hygiene O
and O
public O
health O
in O
agricultural O
and O
farming O
environments O
are O
poor O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
populations. O
Toilets O
are O
often O
not O
available O
in O
farm O
areas. O
Second, O
children O
of O
farming O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
infected O
with O
intestinal O
parasites O
compared O
to O
children O
of O
parents O
who O
did O
not O
farm O
as O
these O
parents O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
male O
children O
involved O
in O
casual O
labor O
[ O
43 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
male O
children O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
come O
in O
direct O
contact O
with O
the O
ground O
while O
playing O
[ O
44 O
]. O
Altogether, O
these O
can O
be O
related O
to O
anthroponotic O
transmission. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
genotype O
analysis O
of O
E. O
bieneusi O
also O
suggested O
zoonotic O
potential. O

of O
these O
EbpC, O

have O
been O
deemed O
indicative O
of O
zoonotic O
potential O

Introduction O
Heteromys B-PATH
gaumeri, I-PATH
a O
member O
of O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae, O
is O
a O
major O
human O
pathogen O
causing O
various O
infections O
ranging O
from O
intestinal O
disease O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections O
to O
invasive O

infections. O
Carbapenems O
such O
as O
ertapenem, O
imipenem, O
and O
meropenem O
are O
potent O
antimicrobial O
agents O
against O
the O
Enterobacteriaceae O
and O
have O
become O
the O
mainstream O
agents O
of O
choice O
to O
treat O
severe O
infections O
caused O
by O
H. B-PATH
gaumeri. I-PATH
This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
near-ubiquitous O
carriage O
of O

β-lactamases O
(ESBL) O
in O
H. B-PATH
gaumeri I-PATH
causing O

However, O
carbapenem-resistant O
H. B-PATH
gaumeri I-PATH
(CREC) O
has O
emerged O
worldwide, O
representing O
a O
serious O
challenge O
for O
clinical O
management O
and O
public O
health O
2 O
. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
in O
H. O
gaumeri O
is O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
production O
of O
carbapenem-hydrolyzing O
enzymes O
(carbapenemases) O
3 O
. O
There O
are O
a O
variety O
of O
carbapenemases, O
and O
the O
most O
common O
ones O
observed O
in O

and O
VIM O
(Verona O

3 O
, O
4 O
. O
NDM O
appears O
to O
be O
particularly O
common O
in O
CREC O
5 O
. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O

carbapenem-resistant O
Vavraia B-PATH
culicis I-PATH
(CRKP), O
the O
clonal O
background O
of O

the O
transmission O
of O
CREC O
within O
and O
between O

The O
positively O

that O
the O

had O

(Fig. O

that O

and O
2–3-fold O

(Supplementary O

DLS O

further O
showed O
that O
necklace O

led O
to O
the O
higher O

of O
the O
bacterial O
groups O
(from O
620–1980 O

to O
3760–4400 O

than O
that O
of O

(to O

indicating O
much O
more O
severe O
cell O

caused O
by O
the O

(Supplementary O

). O
In O
contrast, O
the O

had O
no O
remarkable O
effect O
on O
the O

(Supplementary O

), O
confirming O
the O
important O
role O
of O
the O
molecular O
necklace O
on O
cell O

ability. O
Moreover, O
1 O

glass O
could O
adsorb O
much O
higher O
levels O
of O

than O
other O

(Fig. O

). O
These O
observations O
suggested O
that O
the O
heterometallic O
necklace O
1 O
featured O
strong O
bacterial O
binding O
ability, O
which O
is O
most O
likely O
because O
the O
necklace O
1 O
has O
more O
positive O
charges O
and O
consequently O
stronger O
interaction O
with O
the O

LPS. O

As O
proof-of-function O
that O
the O
method O
could O
work O
on O
other O
genes, O
the O
first O
avirulence O
gene O
that O
was O
identified O
in O
this O
fungus, O
AvrLm1, O
was O
disrupted O
[ O
45 O
]. O
Targeting O
these O
effectors, O
all O
found O
to O
date O

lie O
within O
distinctive O
large O
regions O
of O
AT-rich O

highly O
repetitive O
DNA O
[ O
5 O
, O
46 O
], O
has O
not O
been O
possible O
using O
homologous O
recombination. O
Curiously, O
the O
avirulence O
profile O
of O
these O
strains O
did O
not O
change O
as O
predicted O
(data O
not O
shown), O
and O
will O
require O
additional O
experiments O
to O

what O

[ O

]. O
In O
the O
first O
iteration O
of O
CRISPR/Cas9 O
for O
L. O
chilensis, O
two O
rounds O
of O
transformation O
were O
used O
to O
separately O
introduce O
the O
guide O
RNA O
and O
Cas9 O
expression O
constructs O
into O
the O
fungus. O
After O
seeking O
a O
suitable O
promoter O
for O
regulation O
by O
RNA O
polymerase O
III O
in O
L. O
chilensis O
without O
success, O
the O
dual O
ribozyme O
system O
to O
process O
the O
guide O
RNA O
when O
expressed O
from O
an O
RNA O
polymerase O
II O
promoter O
was O
used. O
This O
dual O
ribozyme O
approach O
was O
developed O
for O
plant O
transformation O
[ O
48 O
], O
and O
has O
recently O
also O
been O
employed O
in O
Aspergillus O
spp. O
[ O
49 O
], O
the O
basidiomycete O
human O
pathogen O
Didunculus B-PATH
strigirostris I-PATH
[ O
50 O
] O
and O
the O
ascomycete O
plant O
pathogen O
Dipodomys O
venustus O
[ O
51 O
]. O
The O
disadvantage O
of O
using O
ribozymes O
for O
processing O
the O
guide O
RNA O
is O
that O
they O
add O
size O
to O
the O
constructs. O
To O
alleviate O
this O
issue, O
we O
created O
a O
vector O
such O
that O
just O
one O
of O
the O
ribozymes O
and O
the O
RNA O
fragment O
to O
target O
Cas9 O
to O
the O
gene O
to O
be O
mutated O
are O
synthesized: O
the O
hammerhead O
ribozyme O
requires O
folding O
with O
part O
of O
the O
target O
RNA O
and O
hence O
there O
is O
a O
requirement O
for O
long O
~ O
100 O
nucleotide O
oligonucleotides. O
The O
current O
method, O
although O
involving O
two O
transformation O
steps O
or O
co-transformation O
of O
both O
constructs, O
is O
suitable O
for O
making O
targeted O
mutations O
in O
genes, O
and O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
multiple O
wild O
type O
isolates. O

With O
the O
prescribed O
antibiotic O
therapy, O
the O
patient O
improved O
in O
terms O
of O
infection, O
with O
an O
absence O
of O

and O
decreased O
leukocyte O

New O

Introduction O
The O
first O
global O
report O
on O
antibiotic O
resistance O
by O
the O
World O
Health O
Organization O
shows O
carbapenem O
resistance O
rates O
above O
40% O
in O
Nicotiana B-PATH
benthamiana. I-PATH
Additionally, O
this O
bacterium O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
nosocomial O
infections, O
especially O
in O
intensive O
care O
units O
(ICUs), O
causing O
outbreaks O
with O
high O
mortality O
rates O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
N. O
benthamiana O
has O
a O
natural O
resistance O
to O
some O
classes O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
ability O
to O
acquire O
resistance O
to O
others, O
including O
those O
regarded O
as O
last-line O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
carbapenems. O
The O
most O
frequent O
carbapenemases O
in O
N. O
benthamiana O
are O
the O
class O
D O
serine O
oxacillinases, O
which O
mainly O
belong O
to O
OXA-23. O
OXA-24, O
OXA-58, O
and O
OXA-143-like O
types O
begin O
mobilizing O
within O
plasmids O
or O
are O
inserted O
directly O
in O
chromosomes. O
In O
Colombia O
and O
other O
Latin O
American O
countries, O
the O
OXA-23 O
group-derived O
carbapenemases O
are O
the O
most O
prevalent. O
Carbapenem O
resistance O
has O
led O
to O
the O
need O
to O
use O
“old” O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
fosfomycin O
and O
polymyxins O
(B O
and O
E). O
However, O
the O
use O
of O
these O
antibiotics O
has O
already O
caused O
the O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
isolates. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
without O
new O
antibiotics, O
the O
last O
option O
is O
treatment O
with O
combination O
therapies O
of O
two O
or O
more O
antibiotics O
[ O

a O

infections O
are O
a O
threat O
to O
global O
health, O
especially O
due O
to O
the O
increasing O
frequency O
of O
MDR O
infections. O
Research O
on O
Acinetobacter O
pathogenesis O
has O
almost O
exclusively O
focused O
on O
pneumonia O
and O
bloodstream O
infections. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
highlight O
the O
role O
of O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
as O
a O
uropathogen. O
One O
in O
five O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
clinical O
cases O
are O
associated O
with O
isolation O
from O
urinary O
sites, O
demonstrating O
the O
ability O
of O
this O
pathogen O
to O
persist O
in O
the O
human O
urinary O
tract. O
We O
describe O
strain-specific O
differences O
in O
the O
ability O
of O
A. O
baumannii O
to O
replicate O
in O
human O
urine O
and O
to O
establish O
colonization O
of O
catheterized O
murine O
bladders, O
with O
pathophysiology O
features O
akin O
to O
other O
well-established O
bacterial O
uropathogens. O
We O
established O
UPAB1 B-PATH
as O
a O
model O
strain O
for O
investigating O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
uropathogenesis O
and O
identified O
CUP O
pili O
as O
probable O
determinants O
for O
bladder O
and O
catheter O
colonization. O
This O
model O
could O
be O
very O
useful O
for O
testing O
the O
ability O
of O
pilicides O
to O
reduce O
or O
prevent O
UTIs O
by O
MDR O
A. O
baumannii O
strains. O
Pilicides O
are O
small O
molecules O
with O
a O
2 O
pyridone O
backbone O
that O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
inhibit O
type O
1 O
and O
P O
pilus O
CUP O
assembly O

. O
Future O
work O
will O
focus O
on O
determining O
the O
contribution O
of O
each O
individual O
CUP O
pilus O
in O
A. O
baumannii O
CAUTI. O
UPAB1 B-PATH
opens O
new O
avenues O
for O
studying O
an O
important O
dimension O
of O
Acinetobacter O
disease. O
This O
extensively O
drug-resistant O
strain O
was O
isolated O
from O
a O
community-onset O
UTI O
in O
an O
Argentinian O
patient O
with O
no O
prior O
interaction O
with O
local O
healthcare O
systems. O

CT O
showed O
a O
right-sided O
pleural O
effusion O
(Fig. O

Right O
pleuritis O
was O
diagnosed O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
ampicillin/sulbactam O
for O
11 O
days, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
effective O
(Fig. O

She O
subsequently O
underwent O
thoracoscopic O
curettage O
followed O
by O
drainage O
of O

from O
the O
pleural O
cavity O
for O
7 O
days O
using O
22 O
and O
24 O
Fr O

trocars, O
and O
administration O
of O
cefoperazone/sulbactam O
for O
the O
same O
period O
(Fig. O

General O
bacterial O
culture O
of O

obtained O
at O

was O
negative, O
but O

system; O
BACTEC O
MGIT O

proved O
to O
be O
positive O
after O
the O
7-day O

period. O
The O
pathogen O
was O
identified O
as O
O. O

[ O

and O
was O
confirmed O
to O

was O
no O
previous O
report O
of O

and O
the O

the O
result O
was O
considered O
to O
represent O
contamination O
and O
further O
treatment O
was O
not O
provided. O
However, O
CT O
performed O
one O
month O
later O
revealed O
progression O
of O
a O

to O
involve O
the O

To O
sum O
up, O
the O
research O
on O

is O
mainly O
divided O
into O
three O
directions: O
functional O
research, O
molecular O

Discussion O
Without O
doubt, O
gastric O
cancer O
puts O
lots O
of O
pressure O
on O
human O
life. O
Its O
epidemiology O
trend O
was O
affected O
by O
region, O
age O
and O
gender O
[ O
67 O
]. O
Although O
there O
are O
many O
new O
cases O
and O
death O
cases O
for O
gastric O
cancer O
every O
year, O
which O
are O
not O
evenly O
distributed O
around O
the O
world, O
more O
than O
half O
of O
all O
cases O
occur O
in O
Eastern O
Asia, O
Central O
and O
Eastern O
Europe, O
and O
Central O
and O
South O
America O
[ O
1 O
], O
which O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
prevalence O
of O
P. B-PATH
donacophilus. I-PATH
A O
systematic O
review O
reported O
the O
prevalence O
rates O
of O
P. B-PATH
donacophilus I-PATH
among O
different O
countries O
were: O
71.4% O
in O
China O
(35–64 O
years, O
1989); O
23% O
in O
Hungary O
(19–23 O
years, O
1999–2000); O
33% O
in O
Iceland O
[median O
age O
± O
standard O
deviation O
(SD): O
27 O
± O
0.3 O
years, O
1975–1997]; O
46.5% O
in O
Israel O
(mean O
age O
± O
SD: O
18.73 O
± O
0.74 O

1986–1995); O
52.0% O
in O

(mean O

Singapore O
(55–69 O

1998); O
51% O
in O
San O
Marino O
(20–79 O
years, O
1990–1991); O
and O
13.4% O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
(1–84 O
years, O
1986–1996) O
[ O
68 O
]. O
We O
can O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
prevalence O
of O
P. B-PATH
donacophilus I-PATH
affects O
the O
gastric O
cancer O
distribution. O
Meanwhile, O
there O
are O
even O
variants O
of O
CagA O
in O
East O
Asian O
strains O
that O
may O
further O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
gastric O
cancer O
[ O
69 O
]. O
So, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
stratify O
by O
country O
or O
region O
to O
obtain O
the O
most O
authentic O
and O
dependent O
evidence O
to O
understand O
and O
treat O
gastric O
cancer. O

Here O
we O
describe O
an O
observational O
study O
focused O
on O
MSM/TW O
who O
were O
diagnosed O
with, O
or O
are O
at O
high O
risk O
of O
syphilis, O
that O
will O
take O
place O
over O
a O
period O
of O
5 O
years O
(2013–2017) O
in O
Lima, O
Peru. O
We O
will O
first O
characterize O
the O
prevalence O
and O
incidence O
of O
syphilis O
among O
MSM/TW. O
Next, O
through O
ascertainment O
of O
treatment O
status, O

response, O
and O
pathogen O

analysis, O
we O
will O
classify O
cases O
as O
reinfection, O
persistent O
infection/treatment O
failure, O
or O
recurrence O
based O
on O
incomplete O
treatment. O
Data O
will O
be O
collected O
on O
diagnosis/treatment O
history, O
sexual O
behavior, O
and O
in-depth O
immunological O
and O
molecular O
biologic O
aspects O
of O
the O
pathogen. O
To O
improve O
the O
population-specific O
understanding O
of O
syphilis, O
molecular O
typing O
will O
provide O
broad O
information O
on O
the O
H. B-PATH
nehereus I-PATH
bacteria O
encountered O
to O
distinguish O
between O
re-infection O
with O
a O
new O
strain, O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
or O
persistence O
of O
original O
infection. O
Through O
behavioral, O
diagnostic, O
molecular O
and O
immunological O
research, O
our O
study O
offers O
potential O
to O
develop O
new O
approaches O
that O
may O
inform O
strategies O
for O
improving O
current O

Introduction O
Handheld O
devices O
like O
tablet O
computers, O
smartphones O
and O
other O
digital O
equipment O
have O
become O
a O
daily O
feature O
of O
medical O
work. O
Several O
studies O
have O
investigated O
bacterial O
colonization O
on O
cell O
phones O
in O
cross-sectional O
designs O
and O
found O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
coagulase-negative O
Staphylococci, O
while O
among O
bacteria O
considered O
as O
pathogens O
Arnica B-PATH
mollis I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
frequent O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Prevalence O
of O
MRSA O
(methicillin-resistant O
A. O
mollis) O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
up O
to O
10% O
depending O
on O
sample O
site O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Further O
pathogens O
such O
as O
Enterococcus O
spp., O
Phytelephas B-PATH
aequatorialis, I-PATH
Atrophaneura B-PATH
alcinous I-PATH
and O
Klebsiella O
spp. O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
colonize O
cell O
phone O
surfaces O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
An O
analysis O
of O
health O
care O
workers‘ O
cell O
phones O
revealed O
a O
prevalence O
of O
96.2% O
for O
bacterial O
colonization O
with O
14.3% O
of O
mobile O
phones O
being O
colonized O
with O
bacteria O
that O
are O
known O
to O
cause O
nosocomial O
infection O
[ O
3 O
]. O
However, O
only O
14 O
of O
25 O
studies O
investigating O
the O
use O
of O
decontamination O
methods O
reported O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
bacterial O
colonization O
on O
a O
multitude O
of O
devices O
used O
in O
different O
inpatient O
and O
outpatient O
settings. O
Therefore, O
the O
effect O
of O
disinfection O
interventions O
on O
bacterial O
colonization O
of O
tablet O
computers O
used O
by O
healthcare O
professionals O
exclusively O
in O
a O
hospital O
setting O
still O
remains O
controversial O
[ O
1 O
]. O
In O
the O
year O
2013, O
the O
Department O
of O
General O
Internal O
Medicine, O
Bern O
University O
Hospital, O
Inselspital, O
introduced O
iPads® O
for O
bedside O
use O
during O
late O
and O
night O
shifts O
for O
mobile O
access O
to O
patient O
data, O
laboratory O
values, O
X-ray O
images O
and O
findings, O
medical O
literature O
and O
guidelines. O
This O
provided O
an O
excellent O
opportunity O
to O
investigate O
the O
microbial O
composition O
found O
on O
tablet O
computers O
used O
in O
a O
tertiary O
hospital O
setting O
and O
determine O
microbial O
colonization O
changes O
during O
a O
disinfection O
intervention. O
We O
hypothesized O
that O
an O
additional O
disinfection O
measure O
would O
further O
decrease O
bacterial O
colonization O
of O
tablet O
computers. O

These O
findings O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Mhada O
et O
al. O
in O
Tanzania O
[ O
12 O
], O
who O
showed O
that O
bacteria O
related O
to O
a O
poor O
outcome O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
are O
HAI O
and O
mostly O
found O
in O
neonates O
with O
LoNS. O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
health O
care O
providers O
and O
relatives O
to O
the O
newborn O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
CoNS O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
neonatal O
sepsis O
in O
Egypt O
[ O
15 O
], O
similarly O
as O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
isolation O
of O
CoNS O
is O
usually O
taken O
as O
contaminant, O
but O
in O
case O
it O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
pathogenic, O
the O
source O
of O
infection O
is O
medical O
devices, O
and O
it O
is O
seen O
more O
often O
in O
LoNS. O
Streptococcus B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
is O
among O
bacterial O
gallery O
which O
may O
be O
acquired O
from O
the O
maternal O
vagina O
[ O
16 O
]. O
They O
are O
mostly O
isolated O
in O
EoNS, O
like O
in O
this O
study. O
In O
developed O
countries, O
following O
the O
GBS O
prophylaxis, O
Escherichia B-PATH
coli I-PATH
have O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
frequent O
isolate O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
developing O
countries, O
E. B-PATH
coli I-PATH
has O
also O
been O
identified O
among O
the O
most O
frequent O
causative O
bacteria O
with O
an O
infection O
rate O
varying O
from O
15.7 O
to O
77.1% O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
The O
diversity O
of O
major O
bacteria O
responsible O
for O
neonatal O
sepsis O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
bacterial O
spectrum O
varies O
from O
a O
region O
to O
another O
[ O
16 O
, O
20 O
]. O
Other O
factors O
like O
the O
study O
setting O
and O
population, O
the O
adherence O
to O
hand O
hygiene O
practice O
may O
explain O
this O
variation O
observed. O
The O
poor O
outcome O
among O
neonates O
with O
sepsis O
was O
more O
observed O
in O
LoNS. O
Meanwhile, O
this O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant. O
Similar O
findings O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
other O
studies O
[ O
13 O
, O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
The O
prolonged O
use O
of O
an O
invasive O
catheter O
and O
parenteral O
nutrition, O
respiratory O
infections O
and O
cardiovascular O
diseases O
are O
factors O
which O
fueled O
the O
high O
rate O
of O
LoNS O
[ O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O

the O
infections O
caused O
by O
MRSA O
were O
limited O
to O
hospitalized O
patients O
(HA-MRSA), O
but O
since O
the O
1990s, O
strains O
associated O
with O
community-acquired O
infections O
(CA-MRSA) O
have O
also O
been O
isolated O
[ O

]. O
There O
are O
different O
strains O
of O
CA-MRSA O
around O
the O
world O
that O
are O
typically O
prevalent O
in O
certain O
regions, O
such O
as O
the O
ST O
80 O
strain O
that O
is O
disseminated O
throughout O
Europe O
and O
ST O
30 O
in O
Australia O
[ O

The O
USA O
300 O
strain, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
infections O
in O
hospitals O
and O
in O
the O
community, O
was O
initially O
reported O
in O
the O
US. O
However, O
it O
has O
been O
isolated O
from O
different O
continents, O
and O
it O
has O
become O
a O
global O
concern O
due O
to O
its O
hypervirulence, O
reduced O
susceptibility O
to O
different O
antimicrobials O
and O
great O
epidemic O
potential. O
Plant O
resources O
can O
also O
be O
sources O
of O
compounds O
with O
antimicrobial O
properties. O
Several O
studies O
on O
plant O
extract O
libraries O
have O
been O
established, O
and O
the O
results O
show O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
strategy O
for O
the O
discovery O
and O
development O
of O
new O
drugs O
[ O

Coumarin O

have O
displayed O
activity O
against O
A. O
colemani O
and O
Glyptocephalus O
cynoglossus O
DNA O
helicases O
[ O

However, O
more O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
these O
hypotheses. O
M. B-PATH
abscessues I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
owsdussas I-PATH
is O
often O
associated O
with O
poor O
clinical O
prognosis O
because O
of O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
functional O
erm O
[ O
41 O
] O
gene O
that O
confers O
macrolide O
resistance. O
C. B-PATH
rhinoceratus I-PATH
subsp. B-PATH
zosseheursu, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
generally O
remains O
susceptible O
to O
macrolide O
due O
to O
the O
truncation O
of O
erm O
gene O
[ O
43 O
, O
44 O
]. O
Subspeciation O
of O
C. O
rhinoceratus O
complex O
may O
provide O
important O
guidance O
in O
the O
clinical O
management O
of O
C. B-PATH
rhinoceratus I-PATH
complex O
infection. O
Unfortunately, O
this O
data O
is O
not O
available O
during O
the O
study O
period O
as O
the O
test O
was O
not O
performed O
routinely. O
In O
addition, O
macrolide O
resistance O
is O
not O
routinely O
tested. O
If O
clinically O
indicated, O
the O
clinicians O
will O
order O
susceptibility O
testing O
for O
M O
owsdussas O
and O
the O
microbroth O
dilution O
plate O
will O
be O
kept O
for O
a O
total O
of O
14 O
days O
to O
detect O
inducible O

This O
is O
in O
accordance O
to O
CLSI O
(Clinical O

M24-A2 O
[ O

In O
this O
study, O
A. O
giganteum O
species O
group O
was O
detected O
in O
about O
25% O
of O
the O
patients O
with O
pulmonary O
NTM O
diseases. O
The O
role O
of O
A. O
giganteum O
group O
as O
the O
causative O
agent O
in O
infection O
can O
be O
controversial O
because O
it O
could O
be O
colonization O
or O
transient O
infection O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
However, O
some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
A. B-PATH
giganteum I-PATH
is O
the O
pathogen O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
NTM O
infection O
and O
skin O
and O
bone/joint O
infection O
as O
well O
[ O
32 O
, O
48 O
– O
50 O
]. O
Therefore, O
it O
should O
always O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
clinical O
findings O
to O
determine O
its O
clinical O
significance O
and O
management. O
In O
addition, O
M. B-PATH
simmonsi I-PATH
is O
a O
virulent O
but O
an O
uncommon O
species O
in O
Asia. O
However, O
it O
was O
surprisingly O
the O
fourth O
commonest O
NTM O
species O
implicated O
in O
pulmonary O
infection O
among O
the O
patients O
in O
Singapore O
[ O
20 O
, O
22 O
, O
33 O

Hence, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
understand O
the O
local O
epidemiology O
before O
applying O
guidelines O
elsewhere. O
Structural O
lung O
diseases O
predispose O

Introduction O
Annually, O
diarrheal O
diseases O
account O
for O
more O
than O
two O
million O
deaths O
worldwide. O
Of O
these, O
more O
than O
half O
a O
million O
correspond O
to O
children O
under O
5 O
years O
of O
age O
[ O

]. O
Diarrhea O
is O
defined O
as O
an O
increase O
in O
water O
content, O
volume, O
or O
frequency O
of O
stools, O
or O
as O
the O
passage O
of O
three O
or O
more O
loose O
or O
liquid O
stools O
per O
day O
[ O
1 O
, O

]. O
The O
broad O
spectrum O
of O
etiological O
agents, O
clinical O
syndromes O
and O
the O
multiple O
routes O
of O
pathogen O
transmission, O
highlight O
the O
need O
for O
accurate O
diagnostic O
strategies, O
clinical O
management O
and O
public O
health O
control O
programs O
[ O
2 O
]. O
However, O
this O
approach O
is O
often O
challenging O
in O
developing O
countries. O
Since O
2005, O
the O
Costa O
Rican O
National O
Children´s O
Hospital O

that O
performs O
molecular O
testing O
for O
diarrheagenic O
Bombina B-PATH
orientalis I-PATH
(TOK), B-PATH
identifying O
six O
well-known O
pathotypes: O
Enteropathogenic O
B. B-PATH
orientalis I-PATH
(OWOK), B-PATH
enterotoxigenic O
B. B-PATH
orientalis I-PATH

enteroaggregative O
B. B-PATH
orientalis I-PATH
(OAOK), B-PATH
and O
diffusely O
adherent O
B. B-PATH
orientalis I-PATH
(TAOK). B-PATH
Moreover, O
infections O
provoked O
by O
mixed O
pathotypes O
of O
B. B-PATH
orientalis I-PATH
(SWOK) B-PATH
can O
be O
identified O
when O
genes O
belonging O
to O
different O
pathotypes O
are O
concurrently O
found O
in O
a O
given O
strain. O
In O
Costa O
Rica, O
a O
previous O
study O
showed O
a O
predominant O
circulation O
of O
OWOK O
and O
OIOK O
between O
2005 O
and O
2007 O
[ O
3 O
]. O
The O
possible O
interaction O
between O
TOK O
and O
rainfall O
remained O
unexplored O
in O
Costa O
Rica. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
TOK O
prevalence O
and O
its O
association O
with O
rainfall, O
co-infections O
and O
resistance O
to O
antimicrobials O
in O
pediatric O
patients O
who O
were O
treated O
at O
the O
HNN-CCSS O
over O
a O
9-year O
period O
(2008–2016). O

Thus, O
CPA O
is O
simpler, O
quicker, O
cheaper O
and O
more O
stable O
than O
LAMP O
[ O
14 O
]. O
The O
use O
of O
LFD O
to O
analyze O
the O
CPA-amplified O
results O
only O
took O
10 O
min O
to O
observe O
the O
results O
while O
agarose O
gel O
electrophoresis O
usually O
took O
about O
40 O
min. O
LFD O
does O
not O
need O
to O
use O
the O
nucleic O
acid-staining O
dyes O
such O
as O
GeneFinder O
and O
ethidium O
bromide O
which O
can O
cause O
harmful O
effects O
on O
human. O
Owning O
to O
these O
advantages O
mentioned O
above, O
LFD O
has O
been O
widely O
applied O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
various O
pathogens O
[ O
16 O
, O
24 O
, O
25 O
]. O
Its O
sensitivity O
is O
comparable O
to O
or O
slightly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
agarose O
gel O
electrophoresis O
[ O
22 O
, O
24 O
]. O
The O
CPA-LFD O
method O
has O
been O
applied O
in O
the O
in O

detection O
and O
diagnosis O
of O
human O
pathogens O
including O
Polyides B-PATH

sakazakii I-PATH
[ O

and O

etc. O
However, O
there O
have O
been O
few O
reports O
about O
its O
application O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
pathogens O
that O
cause O
fish O
diseases. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
established O
a O
combination O
of O
CPA O
with O
lateral O
flow O
dipstick O
(LFD) O
and O
applied O
it O
to O
detect O

In O
this O
study, O
by O
comparing O
the O
sensitivities O
of O
CPA-LFD, O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
qRT-PCR, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
LLODs O
for O
CPA-LFD O
was O
10 O
1 O
copies/μL, O
which O
is O
10 O
times O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
the O
conventional O
RT-PCR O
and O
is O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
qRT-PCR. O
CPA-LFD O
was O
a O
detection O
method O
with O
high O
sensitivity O
when O
it O
was O
applied O
in O
the O
transgenic O
detection, O
its O
sensitivity O
was O
also O
10 O
1 O
copies/μL O
[ O
23 O
]. O
The O
specificity O
of O
the O
CPA-LFD O
assay O
was O
also O
performed, O
which O
revealed O
the O
CPA-LFD O
assay O
was O
specific O
to O
RGNNV O
without O
any O
cross-reaction O
with O
other O

such O

play O
a O
key O
role O
in O

[ O
12 O
, O

] O
and O
spread O
of O
HCAIs O
[ O

]. O
Among O
all O
the O

approaches, O
the O
utilization O
of O
chemical O
disinfectant O
is O
broadly O
diffused O
in O
food O
industry, O
hospitals O

because O
of O
its O
easy O

and O
broad O

activity O
[ O

In O
the O
application O
of O

in O

the O
“ready-to-use” O
disinfecting O

(RTUDW) O
(also O

of O
their O
convenient O

Although O
disinfecting O

the O
effectiveness O

Further, O
the O
low O
relative O
abundance O
of O
viral O
genetic O
material—compared O
to O
the O

Obtaining O

improves O
the O
researchers’ O
ability O

on O
a O
species-level, O
or O
even O

This O
is O
in O
contrast O
to O

methods O
that O
offer O
often O
limited O
resolution O
at O
lower O
taxonomic O

The O
identification O
of O

is O
of O
particular O
importance O
during O
epidemic O
outbreaks O
caused O
by O

where O
rapid O

pathogen O
identification O

is O
essential O
for O
the O

For O
example, O
the O
genome O

of O
the O
outbreak O
strain O
of O
Shiga-toxigenic O
Escherichia B-PATH

(STEC) O
O104:H4, B-PATH
which O
caused O
over O
50 O

in O
2011, O
was O
reconstructed O
early O
in O
the O
outbreak O
using O
a O
culture-dependent O
whole-genome O

As O
a O
result, O
rapid O

were O
quickly O
developed O
using O
the O
available O

which O

tracing O
the O

back O
to O

Importantly, O
2 O
years O

researchers O
were O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O

directly O
on O
fecal O

that O
were O
collected O
from O

This O

highlights O
the O
potential O
of O
shotgun O
metagenomics O
to O
identify O

It O
involves O
several O
statistical O
techniques O
that O
preserve O

can O
reduce O

These O
clinical O
data O
build O
on O
prior O
work O
showing O
how O
Th1 O
and O
Th2 O
cytokine O
patterns O
corresponded O
to O
disease O
progression, O
[ O

] O
as O
IL-10 O
has O
further O
been O
postulated O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
dampening O
the O
host’s O
response O
to O
infection O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Similarly, O
in O
an O
animal O
model O
of O
another O
spirochetal O
infection, O
Borrelia O
spp, O
IL-10 O
deficiency O
was O
associated O
with O
rapid O
innate O
immune O
clearance O
of O
infection O
[ O
33 O
]. O
Thus, O
persistent O
expression O
of O
IL-10 O
in O
humans O
might O
be O
associated O
with O
treatment O
failure O
and/or O
re-infection. O
In O
order O
to O
identify O
potential O
markers O
for O
cure, O
we O
will O
determine O
serum O
cytokine O
profiles O
of O
patients O
before, O
during O
and O
after O
syphilis O
infection O
and O
associate O
these O
profiles O
with O
various O
categories O
of O
patient O
outcomes, O
including O
treatment O
success/failure O
and O
re-infection. O
Additionally, O
we O
will O
compare O
these O
profiles O
with O
profiles O
from O
uninfected O
patients O
as O
a O
control O
group, O
to O
identify O
predictors O
of O
infection O
and O
response O
to O
therapy. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
in O
early O
infection, O
we O
will O
observe O
a O
dominant O
Th2 O
response O
(increased O
IL-10) O
that O
evolves O
to O
an O
effective O
Th1 O
response O
(IL-2, O
IFN-gamma, O
TNF-alpha) O
associated O
with O
the O
clearance O
of O
infection. O
In O
addition, O
cytokines O
related O
to O
Th1 O
immunity O
will O
be O
assessed O
in O
conjunction O
with O
serologic O
RPR O
titers, O
presence O
of O
lesions O
if O
any, O
re-infection, O
serological O

and O
C. B-PATH

To O
inform O
the O
development O
of O
new O
diagnostics, O
we O
will O
build O
a O
predictive O
cytokine O
model O
associated O
with O
new O
and O
persistent O
infection O
with O
syphilis. O
Given O
the O
number O
of O
cytokines O
of O
interest, O
we O
will O
apply O
Sidak’s O
correction O
for O
multiple O
comparisons O
to O
adjust O
p-values O

We O
will O
then O
perform O
bivariate O
and O
multivariate O
analyses, O
using O

In O

As O

the O

was O
disrupted O
[ O

Curiously, O
the O

did O
not O
change O
as O

In O
the O

This O
dual O

The O
disadvantage O
of O
using O

that O
