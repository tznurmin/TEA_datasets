In O
fact, O
the O
bacterial O
host-switching O
between O
nematode O
species, O
even O
those O
representing O
different O
clades, O
seems O
to O
be O
rare O
but O
possible, O
especially O
that O
associations O
of O
nematodes O
with O
new O
symbiotic O
partners O
may O
enable O
colonization O
of O
new O
niches O
or O
extend O
one O
by O
conferring O
significant O
fitness O
benefits O
(Henry O
et O
al. O
2013 O
; O
Maher O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Nevertheless, O
the O
microsymbiont O
switching O
has O
most O
often O
a O
detrimental O
effect O
on O
the O
nematode O
host O
because O
association O
with O
non-cognate O
symbionts O
results O
in O
a O
decline O
in O
their O
reproduction O
fitness, O
symbiont O
carriage, O
and O
virulence. O
As O
expected, O
nematode-bacterium O
pairs O
with O
bacteria O
closely O
related O
to O
its O
native O
microsymbiont O
are O
more O
efficient O
in O
terms O
of O
reproductive O
fitness O
and O
virulence O
than O
those O
with O
a O
distantly O
related O
microsymbiont. O
The O
reproductive O
success O
of O
the O
nematode O
associated O
with O
non-cognate O
bacteria O
is O
also O
strongly O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
the O
phylogenetic O
distance O
between O
nematodes O
being O
a O
donor O
and O
a O
recipient O
of O
microsymbionts, O
confirming O
that O
the O
nematode O
host O
diversity O
strongly O
influences O
coadaptation O
between O
symbiotic O
partners O
(Murfin O
et O
al. O
2015b O
; O
McMullen O
et O
al. O
2017b O
). O
It O
is O
known O
that O
associations O
between O
obligate O
mutualists, O
involving O
fulfillment O
of O
their O
needs, O
often O
result O
in O
co-speciation O
or O
a O
larger O
phenomenon O
- O
coevolution, O
where O
symbionts O
share O
adaptive O
changes O
and O
their O
evolutionary O
history O
is O
congruent. O
To O
date, O
few O
studies O
based O
on O
comparisons O
of O
the O
gene O
phylogenies O
of O
the O
nematode-bacterium O
partners O
have O
been O
conducted O
to O
assess O
co-speciation O
or O
co-evolution O
events. O

In O
support O
of O
this O
scheme, O
the O
ecotype O
II O
found O
in O
roe O
deer O
was O
for O
example O
not O
the O
one O
found O
in O
livestock O
in O
France O
[ O

]. O
However, O
due O
to O
scarcity O
of O
studies, O
this O
classification O
in O
ecotypes O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
working O
hypothesis O
of O
circulation O
and O
transmission, O
rather O
than O
as O
a O
definitive O
answer. O
Ixodes O

ticks O
are O
now O
expanding O
their O
distribution O
range O
towards O
northern O
latitudes O
[ O
2 O
, O

This O
also O
involves O
a O
shift O
into O
the O
distribution O
range O
of O
another O
community O
of O
mammals O
compared O
to O
continental O
Europe. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
potential O
cervid O
transmission O
hosts O
are O
no O
longer O
limited O
to O
roe O
deer O
and O
red O
deer, O
but O
also O
include O
moose O
(Alces O
alces). O
Moose O
is O
by O
far O
the O
most O
important O
game O
species O
in O
terms O
of O
meat O
and O
economy O
both O
in O
Sweden O
and O
Norway, O
with O
an O
annual O
harvest O
in O
2016 O
of, O
respectively, O
82,097 O
[ O
19 O
] O
and O
30,829 O
[ O

individuals. O
Moose O
is O
widespread O
in O
Fennoscandia, O
and O
it O
is O
important O
to O
assess O
its O
role O
in O
the O
propagation O
of O
ticks O
and O
the O
transmission O
of O
tick-borne O
diseases O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Yet, O
we O
do O
not O
know O
much O
about O
the O
potential O
role O
of O
moose O
as O
a O
transmission O
host O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum. O

in O
both O
Norway O
[ O

and O

[ O

was O
reported O
to O
be O
high. O
However, O
the O
ecotype O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
has O
only O
been O
determined O
in O
two O
moose O
with O
no O

conclusion, O
as O
one O

and O
one O
type O
II O
was O
found O
(data O
from O

reported O

Further, O
the O
geographical O
distribution O
of O
red O
deer O
is O
quite O
rapidly O
expanding O
in O
both O
Norway O

This O

Critical O
challenges O
During O
the O
last O
three O
decades, O
Alzheimer’s O
research O
has O
not O
only O
made O
remarkable O
progress O
in O
understanding O
the O
disease O
but O
also O
has O
recruited O
some O
of O
the O
best O
scientists O
in O
the O
world. O
The O
prospect O
of O
delaying O
or O
preventing O
the O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
is O
feasible O
and O
within O
our O
grasp. O
However, O
this O
mission O
must O
surmount O
a O
number O
of O
barriers, O
which O
contain O
inadequate O
funding O
of O
research, O
high O
cost O
of O
clinical O
studies, O
lack O
of O
suitable O
infrastructure, O
better O
models, O
antiquated O
administrative O
structure O
of O
discovery O
programs, O
and O
arcane O
decision-making O
systems O
for O
selecting O
and O
funding O
innovative O
ideas. O
Recently, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
know O
for O
certain O
that O
someone O
has O
AD O
is O
to O
examine O
an O
autopsy O
of O
their O
brains O
tissue O
after O
death. O
The O
crucial O
challenge O
for O
the O
AD O
researches O
is O
how O
to O
understand O
the O
process O
of O
neurodegenerative O
disorders O
throughout O
the O
patient’s O
lifetime. O
Additionally, O
the O
lack O
of O
efficient O
cultivation O
techniques O
stems O
from O
many O
factors O
that O
largely O
remain O
unknown O
(Lopez O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
Hence, O
molecular O
ecology O
and O
metagenomics O
have O
significantly O
increased O
our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
genetic O
diversity O
and O
have O
led O
to O
interesting O
hypotheses O
(Hugenholtz O
and O
Tyson, O
2008 O
). O
The O
advanced O
techniques O
have O
also O
revealed O
how O
far O
we O
are O
from O
measuring O
the O
full O
extent O
of O
genetic O
diversity O
encoded O
by O
microbial O
life O
(Hugenholtz O
and O

Pignatelli O
et O

Summary O
Microbial O
colonization O
of O
the O

plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
the O
postnatal O
development O
and O
maturation O
of O
the O
immune, O
endocrine O
and O
even O
neural O
systems, O
these O

It O
is O
important O
to O
report O
that O
there O
is O
an O
important O
link O
between O
diabetes O
and O
AD, O
and O
it O
is O
therefore O
common O
that O
pathophysiology O
probably O
constitutes O
a O
major O
underpinning O
of O
late-onset O
sporadic O
AD, O
and O
a O
novel O
therapeutic O
approach O
targeting O
this O
pathological O
process O
could O
contribute O
to O
the O
development O
of O
a O
more O
efficient O
and O
effective O
treatment O
for O
AD O
(Park, O
2011 O
; O
de O

Monte, O
2014 O
). O
Aging O
Alzheimer’s O
cases O
show O
a O
dramatic O
increase O
with O
age, O
affecting O
about O
1% O
of O
the O
population O
aged O
between O
65-69 O
years O
up O
to O
30-40% O
in O
the O
oldest O
individuals O
(Gatz O
et O
al., O
2006 O
). O
Overall O
occurrence O
in O
the O
population O
above O
65 O
years O
of O
age O
is O
estimated O
to O
6-8% O
and O
is O
expected O
to O
increase O
significantly O
worldwide O
due O
to O
changing O
demographic O
profiles O
with O
an O
ever-increasing O
proportion O
of O
elderly O
(Ferri O
et O
al., O
2005 O
). O
Indeed, O
as O
adulthood O
approaches, O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
stabilizes, O
becomes O
more O
diverse, O
and O
can O
resist O
detrimental O
environmental O
elements O
such O
as O
antibiotics O
and O
stress O
by O
restoring O
its O
diverse O
and O
stable O
‘normal’ O
core O
microbiota O
(Palmer O
et O
al., O
2007 O
; O
Rajilic-Stojanovic O
et O
al., O
2011 O
). O
However, O
as O
we O
age, O
the O
diversity O
and O
stability O
of O
our O
microbiota O
will O
decline O
(Biagi O
et O
al., O
2010 O
), O
moreover O
there O
is O
an O
associated O
increase O
in O
number, O
size O
and O
activation O
of O
microglia O
that O
can O
lead O
to O
an O
increased O
inflammatory O
tone O
named O
‘inflammaging’ O
(Franceschi, O
2007 O
; O
von O
Bernhardi O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
There O
is O
high O
heterogeneity O
of O
microglia O
in O
several O
neurodegenerative O
diseases, O
including O
AD O
and O
those O
phenotypes O
share O
common O
characteristics O
with O
aging O
(Bachstetter O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
In O
normal O
aging, O
close O
crosstalk O
with O
astrocytes, O
neurons O
and O
other O
brain O
cells O
serve O
crucial O
functions O
as O
the O
scavenger O
system O
of O
the O
CNS, O
providing O
beneficial O
functions O
such O
as O
tissue O
repair O
in O
the O
CNS. O
However, O
chronic, O
dysregulated O
activation O
of O
microglia O
can O
lead O
to O
elevated O
inflammatory O
tone O
ultimately O
resulting O
in O
the O
malfunction O

of O

The O
average O
premium O
was O
115%, O
more O
than O
double O
the O

but O
individual O

However, O
as O

one O

is O
that O
“decontam O

attempts O

sequence O

Evidence O

has O
indicated O
that O
the O
mycobiome O
(fungi) O

the O

can O
regulate O
systemic O
immunity. O
For O

increased O

Incorporating O

Looking O
forward, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
recognize O
that O
the O
microbiome O
contributes O
only O
one O
dimension O
to O
the O
many O
facets O
that O
govern O
the O
interface O
between O
cancer O

the O

Cancer O

grow O
and O
evolve O
under O
the O
selective O
pressure O
of O

and O
molecular O
evolution O
of O
the O
tumor O
could O
still O
occur O
when O
the O
microbiome O
is O
manipulated O

In O
addition, O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
microbiome O
similarly O
may O
evolve O
over O
the O
course O
of O
cancer O
progression O
and O

administration. O
This O
variation O
offers O
additional O
research O
challenges, O
but O
with O
this O
pliability O
also O
comes O
exciting O
promise O
for O
intervention O
and O
exploiting O
the O
host-microbiome O
interdependency O
to O

Background O
Mucormycosis O
are O
rare O
but O
often O
life-threatening O
infections O
seen O
in O
immunocompromised, O
diabetic, O
and O
organ O
transplant O
patients O
[ O
1 O
]. O
These O
infections O
are O
difficult O
to O
treat O
and O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
diabetic O
patients O
and O
organ O
transplants, O
in O
the O
future O
such O
infections O
are O
likely O
to O
increase O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Rhizopus O
spp. O
accounts O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
mucormycosis O
infections O
[ O

]. O
Results O
in O
recent O
decades O
suggest O
that O
apoptosis O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
both O
establishment O
and O
clearance O
of O
fungal O
infections O
[ O
3 O
]. O
In O
response O
to O
fungal O
infections, O
the O
oxidative O
burst O
by O
host O
immune O
cells O
could O
help O
in O
infection O
clearance O
by O
triggering O
apoptosis O
in O
the O
fungus O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
Also, O
pathogen-induced O
apoptosis O
in O
host O
immune O
cells O
could O
help O
the O
pathogen O
to O
establish O
the O
infection O
[ O
6 O
]. O
Thus, O
the O
success O
of O
an O
infection O
partly O
depends O
on O
the O
outcome O
of O
such O
host O
pathogen O
interactions. O
It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
extracts O
from O
the O
filamentous O
fungus O
could O
induce O
apoptosis O
in O
human O
cells O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
], O
but O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
protein/factor O
responsible O
for O
the O
induction O
of O
apoptosis O
remains O
unknown. O
In O
recent O
decades, O
it O
has O
also O
been O
established O
that O
in O
many O
organisms O
cyt O
c O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
apoptosis O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
During O
apoptosis, O
cyt O
c O
is O
released O
from O
the O
mitochondria O
into O
the O
cytoplasm O
and O
binds O
to O
apoptosis O
protease-activating O
factor-1 O
(Apaf-1) O
thus O
triggering O
a O
caspase O
activation O
cascade O
[ O
8 O
]. O
For O
example, O
in O
humans, O
cyt O
c O
can O
activate O
caspase-3 O
in O
cell-free O
activation O
assay O
[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
first O
evidence O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
apoptosis O
in O
fungi O
came O
from O
the O
study O
by O
Medeo O
et O
al. O
of O
a O
Saccharomyces O

mutant O
that O
showed O
signs O
of O
apoptosis O
[ O

Since O

many O

Two O
producers O
who O
had O
grown O
naked O
barley O
in O
the O
past O
reported O
that O
not O
all O
the O
grains O
free-threshed O
and O
that O
some O
dehulling O
was O
required. O
Interviews O
All O
of O
the O
farmers O
who O
were O
interviewed O
talked O
about O
how O
barley O
fits O
within O
their O
production O
system O
and O
crop O
rotation. O
While O
there O
were O
common O
elements, O
each O
producer O
had O
a O
unique O
way O
of O
integrating O
barley O
into O
their O
farming O
system, O
in O
terms O
of O
place O
in O
rotation, O
cultural O
practices, O
variety O
selection, O
and O
end O
use. O
Several O
producers O
grew O
barley O
for O
multiple O
end-uses O
and O
were O
interested O
in O
a O
multi-purpose O
barley. O
Barley O
was O
the O
main O
crop O
only O
for O
farmers O
who O
were O
contract O
growing O
for O
malt O
houses. O
For O
those O
producers, O
variety O
selection O
was O
made O
by O
contract O
from O
the O
buyer. O
However, O
the O
majority O
of O
producers O
interviewed O
were O
primarily O
selling O
into O
the O
feed O
market, O
which O
reflects O
the O
survey O
results. O
Several O
farmers O
interviewed O
talked O
about O
the O
advantages O
that O
barley O
had O
in O
terms O
of O
land O
use, O
labor O
requirements, O
and O
equipment O
compliment. O
Barley O
was O
often O
grown O
as O
a O
“catch O
crop” O
to O
make O
use O
of O
nutrients O
left O
over O
from O
the O
previous O
crop’s O
fertility O
program, O
particularly O
when O
grown O
as O
a O
winter O
crop. O
More O
importantly, O
several O
farmers O
noted O
that O
crops O
following O
barley O
had O
reduced O
weed O
pressure O
and O
increased O
yield. O
According O
to O
farmers O
interviewed, O
barley O
is O
more O
amenable O
to O
no-till O
systems O
without O
herbicides O
than O
many O
other O
crops O
in O
their O
experience. O
Several O
farmers O
growing O
barley O
were O
organic O
dairy O
producers. O
Because O
cattle O
are O
ruminants, O
they O
can O
digest O
barley O
hulls, O
and O
naked O
barley O
is O
not O
as O
important O
for O
their O
farming O
systems. O
These O
producers O
also O
emphasized O
the O
importance O
of O
barley O
for O
producing O
high-quality O
organic O
straw. O
By O
contrast, O
many O
of O
the O
producers O
who O
grow O
barley O
as O
a O
cash O
crop O
do O
not O
harvest O
the O
straw O
but O
will O
instead O
till O
it O
in O
for O
organic O
matter O
or O
plant O
into O
the O
residue, O
which O
serves O
as O
a O
mulch. O
The O
exceptions O
were O
farmers O
in O
straw-deficient O
areas O
with O
either O
high O
concentrations O
of O
dairy O
farms O
or O
near O
suburban O
markets. O
One O
of O
the O
dairy O
producers O
interviewed O
grows O
barley O
as O
an O
intercrop O
with O
peas. O
The O
mixture O
is O
harvested O
before O
the O
grain O
matures O
and O
is O
fed O
as O
green O
chop. O

Background O
The O
emergence O
of O
multidrug O
resistance O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
has O
led O
to O
high O
rates O
of O
treatment O
failure O
for O
first-line O
artemisinin-based O
combination O
therapy, O
raising O
the O
spectre O
of O
untreatable O
malaria O
in O
this O
region O
and O
threatening O
prospects O
for O
malaria O
elimination O
[ O
1 O
– O
7 O
]. O
The O
discovery O
of O
molecular O
markers O
kelch13 O
(k13) O
and O
plasmepsin2/3 O
for O
resistance O
to O
artemisinin O
and O
piperaquine, O
respectively, O
has O
provided O
valuable O
tools O
for O
tracking O
resistance O
[ O
8 O
– O
10 O
]. O
Artemisinin O
resistance O
is O
both O
spreading O
and O
arising O
independently O
in O
Southeast O
Asia, O
highlighting O
the O
pressing O
need O
for O
surveillance O
to O
guide O
treatment O
policies O
[ O
11 O
, O
12 O
]. O
The O
low O
parasitaemias O
associated O
with O
malaria O
infections O
in O
low-transmission O
settings O
has O
hindered O
surveillance O
efforts. O
Clinical O
infections O
from O
these O
regions O
are O
rare, O
and O
tend O
to O
present O
with O
much O
lower O
parasite O
densities O
than O
those O
found O
in O
high-transmission O
settings, O
such O
as O
Africa. O
Asymptomatic O
infections, O
while O
more O
common, O
have O
even O
lower O
parasite O
densities, O
necessitating O
the O
development O
of O
new O
‘ultrasensitive’ O
techniques O
to O
identify O
them O
in O
these O
settings O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
These O
new O
techniques O
achieve O
vastly O
improved O
sensitivity O
(with O
lower O
limits O
of O
detection O
in O
the O
10 O
s O
of O
parasites/mL) O
either O
by O
collecting O
high-volume O
blood O
samples O
(i.e., O
venous O
blood) O
or O
by O
amplifying O
highly O
abundant O
targets O
such O
as O
18S O
rRNA O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
Importantly, O
these O
methods O
have O
revealed O
a O
large O
reservoir O
of O
previously O
unrecognized O
‘silent’ O
malaria O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
that O
vastly O
outnumbers O
clinically O
apparent O
cases O
[ O
14 O
– O
17 O
]. O
Although O
more O
sensitive, O
these O
new O
methods O
also O
have O
drawbacks. O
For O
one, O
cumbersome O
sampling O
strategies, O
such O
as O
collection O
of O
venous O
blood O
and O
the O
need O
for O
a O
cold O
chain, O
limit O
their O
use O
in O
remote O
settings O
where O
most O
malaria O
is O
found. O
In O
addition, O
while O
the O
same O
eluate O
used O
for O
ultrasensitive O
detection O
can O
be O
used O
to O
characterize O
drug O
resistance O
markers, O
ultrasensitive O
methods O
that O
rely O
on O
amplification O
of O
RNA O
targets O
are O
not O
optimized O
for O
recovery O
of O
parasite O
DNA. O

The O
existence O
of O
many O
supplementary O
plasmids O
and O
pathogenicity O
islands O
in O
the O
genome O
has O
also O
been O
shown O
(Wilkinson O
et O
al. O
2009 O
, O
2010 O
). O
Current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
switch O
of O
these O
bacteria O
from O
nematodes O
to O
humans O
was O
facilitated O
by O
virulence O
genes O
(necessary O
for O
insect O
host O
infection) O
already O
present O
in O
the O
genome, O
as O
well O
as O
additional O
virulence O
factors O
(appropriate O
for O
infection O
of O
mammalian O
cells) O
acquired O
by O
horizontal O
transfer O
from O
other O
human O
pathogens O
(Hapeshi O
and O
Waterfield O
2017 O
). O
Unlike O
other O
species O
of O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus, O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
can O
grow O
at O
37 O
°C, O
undergoing O
the O
metabolic O
shift O
to O
adapt O
their O
metabolisms O
to O
the O
mammalian O
host O
(Mulley O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
Despite O
the O
considerable O
effort, O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
transmission O
of O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
to O
the O
human O
body O
are O
still O
unclear. O
The O
most O
probable O
scenario O
is O
that O
the O
nematode O
vector O
may O
penetrate O
the O
human O
skin O
and O
transmit O
microsymbionts, O
thereby O
causing O
infections O
(Hapeshi O
and O
Waterfield O
2017 O
). O
Conclusion O
The O
symbiotic O
bacteria O
of O
entomopathogenic O
nematodes O
emerged O
as O
a O
relevant O
model O
to O
study O
microorganism-host O
interactions. O
Although O
much O
interest O
in O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
has O
been O
historically O
driven O
by O
their O
symbiotic O
associations O
with O
nematodes, O
it O
is O
now O
clear O
that O
the O
uncovered O
richness O
of O
their O
secondary O
metabolites O
will O
accelerate O
investigations O
of O
these O
bacilli. O
Based O
on O
the O
recent O
advances O
in O
molecular O
phylogeny O
associated O
with O
the O

the O
taxonomy O
of O
the O
symbiotic O

has O
been O
reassessed, O
with O

By O

we O

At O

our O

higher O
metabolic O

in O
T O

and O
T O
EM O
subsets O
compared O

Glycolytic O

revealed O
an O

the O

A O

previously O

whereas O
T O

Our O
data O
similarly O
demonstrate O
the O
distinct O
metabolic O
state O
of O
T O
CM O
cells O
from O
other O
memory O
populations O
both O
with O
and O
without O

This O
illustrates O
the O
ability O
to O
capture O
differential O
responses O
of O
cellular O
subpopulations O
by O
revealing O
diverse O
immuno-metabolic O
states, O
reflecting O
divergent O
metabolic O

and O
function. O
Consistent O
with O
previous O
studies, O
cytokine O
release O
post-activation O
was O
largely O
dependent O
on O
glycolysis O
1 O
. O
We O
showed O
that O
glycolytic O
inhibition O
decreased O
IL-13, O
IL-6, O
sCD40L, O
and O
IL-17A O
production O
from O
T O
cells. O
Interestingly, O
GM-CSF O
was O
not O
dependent O
on O
glycolysis, O
suggesting O
differential O
control O
and O
redundancy O
in O
metabolic O
regulation. O
A O
rapid O
immune O
response, O
including O
cytokine O
production, O
is O
regulated O
by O
post-transcriptional O
mechanisms, O
including O
RNA-binding O
proteins O
and O
translational O
control O
by O
mTOR O
signaling O
15 O
, O
66 O
– O
68 O
. O
Specifically, O
GM-CSF O
mRNA O
stability O
is O
controlled O
by O
protein O
binding O
to O
AU-rich O
elements O
in O
3’-untranslated O
regions, O
which O
direct O
mRNA O
degradation O
and O
control O
half-life O
69 O
, O
70 O
. O
The O
intersection O
of O
cytokine O
biology O
and O
metabolism O
is O
often O
regulated O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level. O

Even O
though O
some O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
in O
cryopreservation O
of O
zebrafish O
embryos O
6 O
, O
these O
methods O
still O
do O
not O
lead O
to O
the O
production O
of O
functional O
embryos O
which O
will O
be O
able O
to O
reconstitute O
a O
whole O
zebrafish O
line. O
Additionally, O
many O
protocols O
for O
freezing O
of O
zebrafish O
sperm O
yielded O
low O
and O
very O
variable O
post-thaw O
motility O
and O
fertilization O
rates O
7 O
– O
9 O
, O
thus O
limiting O
the O
applicability O
of O
sperm O
cryopreservation O
in O
reconstitution O
of O
zebrafish O
lines. O
Recently, O
the O
study O
of O
Matthews O
et O
al. O
10 O
standardized O
the O
sperm O
cryopreservation O
process O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
and O
demonstrated O
that O
reliable O
and O
reproducible O
results O
can O
be O
obtained O
for O
a O
large O
number O
of O
transgenic O
zebrafish O
lines. O
However, O
the O
absence O
of O
methods O
for O
conservation O
of O
female O
genetic O
resources O
still O
remains. O
Due O
to O
the O
reasons O
above, O
we O
have O
focused O
on O
spermatogonial O
stem O
cells O
(SSCs) O
in O
this O
study. O
These O
are O
the O
baseline O
cells O
of O
spermatogenesis O
with O
a O
specific O
function O
to O
both O
self-renew O
and O
differentiate O
into O
later-stage O
germ O
cells O
and O
finally O
into O
spermatozoa O
11 O
. O
Their O
ability O
to O
colonize O
recipient O
gonads O
after O
intraperitoneal O
transplantation, O
proliferate O
and O
differentiate O
into O
functional O
gametes O
(either O
spermatozoa O
or O
eggs O
depending O
on O
the O
sex O
of O
the O
recipient) O
after O
cryopreservation O
and O
to O
produce O
donor-derived O
offspring O
by O
recipients O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
by O
several O
studies O
12 O
– O
14 O
. O
Additionally, O
the O
study O
of O
Seki O
et O
al. O
4 O
demonstrated O
that O
this O
approach O
can O
be O
very O
effective O
in O
the O
conservation O
of O
genetic O
resources O
and O
reconstitution O
of O
important O
lines O
in O
valuable O
laboratory O
animals O
(medaka O
Oryzias O
latipes). O
The O
surrogate O
production O
technology O
poses O
several O
challenges O
during O
its O
implementation. O
Even O
though O
transplanted O
SSCs O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
colonize O
the O
recipient O
gonads, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
the O
autologous O
germ O
cells O
still O
remain. O
In O
fact, O
the O
majority O
of O
gametes O
derived O
from O
such O
recipients O
are O
autologous O
14 O
. O
Due O
to O
this O
reason, O
sterile O
recipients O
became O
imperative, O
and O
several O
strategies O
were O
developed. O

The O
bla O
CTX-M-2-group O
gene O
was O
not O
detected O
in O
ESBL-producing O
strains. O
No O
significant O
differences O
were O
found O
in O
the O
distribution O
of O
bla O
SHV O
, O
bla O
TEM O
, O
and O
bla O
OXA-1-like O
genes O
among O
the O
nosocomial, O
HCA, O
and O
CA O
infection O
groups. O
However, O
the O
bla O
CTX-M-1-group O
and O
bla O
CTX-M-9-group O
genes O
were O
disproportionately O
distributed O
between O
nosocomial, O
HCA, O
and O
CA O
isolates O
(Table O
5 O
). O
Fifty-one O
of O
the O
131 O
ESBL-positive O
strains O
were O
observed O
to O
co-harbor O
bla O
SHV O
and O
bla O
CTX-M-1-group O
, O
with O
74.5% O
(38/51) O
having O
co-existence O
of O
bla O
SHV O
, O
bla O
TEM O
and O
bla O
CTX-M-1-group, O
and O
these O
strains O
were O
more O
commonly O
identified O
in O
the O
CA O
group O
than O
in O
the O
nosocomial O
group O
(61.9% O
vs. O
20.0%, O
P O
= O
0.001; O
42.9% O
vs. O
17.5%, O
P O
= O
0.032, O
respectively). O
Conversely, O
strains O
possessing O
both O
bla O
SHV O
and O
bla O
CTX-M-9-group O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
nosocomial O
infection O
group O
than O
in O
the O
CA O
group O
(55.0% O
vs. O
23.8%, O
P O
= O
0.02). O

This O
approach O
would O
parallel O
the O
strategies O
being O
used O
to O
treat O
refractory O
Clostridium O
difficile O
infection O
in O
patients O
[ O
121 O
]. O
This O
approach O
delivers O
a O
complex O
community O
and O
the O
promise O
to O
transfer O
its O
beneficial O
effect. O
However, O
FMT O
is O
clouded O
by O
uncertainties O
related O
to O
the O
imprecise O
definition O
of O
a O
favorable O
microbiota, O
the O
possibility O
of O
delivering O
immune-regulatory O
bacteria, O
and O
the O
potential O
to O
transfer O
disease-promoting O
bacteria O
such O
as O
those O
contributing O
to O
obesity O
or O
even O
carcinogenesis. O
A O
subtler O
means O
of O
intervention O
may O
include O
modulating O
the O
existing O
commensal O
community O
via O
prebiotics O
or O
dietary O
changes O
to O
favor O
the O
expansion O
of O
beneficial O
bacteria O
that O
require O
specific O
substrates, O
or O
conversely, O
“starving” O
detrimental O
bacteria O
of O
their O
required O
nutrients. O
For O
example, O
short-term O
changes O
in O
human O
macronutrient O
consumption O
towards O
a O
high O
fat, O
low O
fiber O
animal-based O
diet O
increased O
bile-tolerant O
microorganisms O
(Alistipes, O
Bilophila O
and O
Bacteroides) O
and O
decreased O
levels O
of O
Firmicutes O
that O
metabolize O
dietary O
plant O
polysaccharides O
(Roseburia, O
Eubacteriumrectale O
and O
Ruminococcus O
bromii) O
[ O
122 O
]. O
Similarly, O
antibiotics O
could O
be O
considered O
a O
means O
of O
targeting O
immune-regulatory O
bacteria. O
Both O
of O
these O
approaches O
lack O
the O
precision O
to O
modulate O
very O
specific O
bacterial O
populations, O
however, O
and O
may O
have O
variable O
effects O
depending O
on O
the O
starting O
state O
of O
the O
commensal O
community. O
Alternatively, O
beneficial O
or O
immune-potentiating O
bacteria O
could O
be O
prepared O
as O
a O
probiotic O
and O
provided O
as O
an O
immunotherapy O
adjuvant. O
Once O
molecular O
mechanisms O
are O
determined, O
genetic O
manipulation O
of O
the O
selected O
bacteria O
could O
be O
utilized O
to O
maximize O
beneficial O
effects. O
Historically, O
certain O
bacterial O
species O
have O
been O
some O
of O
the O
most O
amenable O
organisms O
to O
genetic O
manipulation, O
and O
the O
breadth O
of O
tools O
available O
to O
study O
and O
modify O
bacteria O
continues O
to O
expand. O
This O
technology O
allows O
the O
modification O
of O
a O
bacterium’s O
existing O
function O
or O
the O
introduction O
of O
completely O
novel O
genes O
[ O
123 O
]. O

Thus, O
it O
could O
be O
hypothesized O
that O
the O
chronic O
use O
of O
NSAIDs O
may O
be O
beneficial O
only O
in O
the O
very O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
AD O
process O
in O
coincidence O
of O
initial O
Aβ O
deposition, O
microglia O
activation O
and O
consequent O
release O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
mediators. O
When O
the O
Aβ O
deposition O
process O
is O
already O
started, O
NSAIDs O
are O
no O
longer O
effective O
and O
may O
even O
be O
detrimental O
because O
of O
their O
inhibitory O
activity O
on O
chronically O
activated O
microglia O
that O
on O
long-term O
may O
mediate O
Aβ O
clearance O
(Imbimbo O
et O
al., O
2010 O
). O
In O
conclusion, O
these O
studies O
indicate O
that O
there O
is O
a O
dose-response O
relationship O
between O
NSAID O
use O
and O
the O
relative O
risk O
of O
AD, O
with O
longer O
periods O
of O
use O
related O
to O
reduce O
relative O
risks O
of O
AD. O
Based O
on O
these O
studies, O
the O
relative O
risk O
of O
AD O
appears O
to O
be O
25-50% O
lower O
in O
groups O
of O
individuals O
with O
long-term O
(2 O
years O
or O
more) O
NSAID O
use O
(in O
t’ O
Veld O
et O
al., O
2001 O
). O
The O
reduction O
in O
risk O
also O
appears O
to O
be O
restricted O
to O
AD; O
no O
protective O
effect O
against O
vascular O
dementia O
was O
noted. O
The O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
to O
the O
accumulating O
Aβ O
and O
tau O
deposits O
worsens O
the O
pathological O
process O
and O
that O
NSAIDs O
may O
alleviate O
the O
process O
by O
inhibiting O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
and/or O
inhibiting O
glutamate O
toxicity O
(Casper O

The O

HCV O

the O

The O

Limitations O
and O
Future O
Directions O
Our O
analysis O
did O
not O
cover O
all O
of O
the O
journals O
that O
publish O
evolutionary O
psychological O
studies. O
Instead, O
mirroring O
the O
work O
that O
has O
been O
done O
in O
other O
reviews O
of O
sample O
diversity O
(e.g. O
Arnett O
2008 O
; O
Gallander O
Wintre O
et O
al. O
2001 O
; O
Sears O
1986 O
), O
we O
focussed O
on O
key O
journals. O
Many O
papers O
on O
evolutionary O
psychology O
are O
published O
outside O
of O
those O
two O
journals. O
Similarly, O
there O
might O
be O
papers O
in O
our O
sample O
which O
have O
a O
different O
focus O
than O
evolutionary O
psychology, O
or O
which O
might O
be O
better O
classified O
as O
relating O
to O
fields O
such O
as O
comparative O
cognition, O
behavioural O
economics, O
linguistics, O
demography, O
or O
anthropology O
among O
others. O
Future O
work O
might O
compare O
one O
journal O
to O
the O
next, O
and O
compare O
across O
a O
sequence O
of O
different O
years, O
to O
determine O
the O
variance O
in O
sample O
diversity. O
Alternatively, O
one O
could O
define O
keywords O
to O
more O
clearly O
delineate O
articles O
covering O
evolutionary O
psychology. O
Further, O
future O
research O
might O
seek O
to O
uncover O
whether O
different O
research O
areas O
within O
evolutionary O
psychology O
are O
more O
or O
less O
reliant O
upon O
non-diverse O
samples, O
and O
how O
this O
corresponds O
to O
their O
development O
as O
a O
research O
area. O
Exploratory O
studies O
might O
well O
choose O
to O
focus O
on O
easily O
accessible O
samples O
such O
as O
undergraduates O
to O
test O
their O
initial O
ideas, O
whereas O
more O
mature O
research O
areas O
ought O
to O
seek O
to O
diversify O
their O
samples O
further O
in O
order O
to O
test O
the O
generalisability O
of O
their O
findings. O
Even O
within O
specific O
research O
areas, O
some O
topics O
have O
been O
studied O
in O
more O
diverse O
worldwide O
samples O
than O
others; O
for O
instance, O
sex O
differences O
in O
partner O
preferences O
draws O
from O
data O
from O
many O
cultures O
(e.g. O
Buss O
1989 O
; O
Shackelford O
et O
al. O
2005 O
), O
whereas O
research O
on O
ovulatory O
shifts O
in O
partner O
preferences O
very O
much O
rests O
upon O
studies O
carried O
out O
in O
English-speaking O
WEIRD O
countries O
(Gildersleeve O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
Our O
survey O
does O
not O
present O
cause O
for O
despair. O
In O
terms O
of O
participant O
diversity, O
evolutionary O
psychology O
does O
rely O
on O
WEIRD, O
student O
samples O
less O
heavily O
than O
some O
fields O
(Apicella O
and O
Barrett O
2016 O
; O
Kurzban O
2013 O
). O

Photorhabdus O
and O
Xenorhabdus O
bacteria O
exhibit O
another O
essential O
feature: O
as O
obligate O
symbionts O
of O
infective O
juveniles O
(IJs) O
of O
entomopathogenic O
nematodes O
(EPNs) O
from O
the O
genera O
Steinernema O
and O
Heterorhabditis, O
respectively, O
they O
spend O
some O
part O
of O
their O
lives O
inside O
nematodes O
using O
them O
as O
a O
vector O
for O
efficient O
infection O
of O
insects O
(Goodrich-Blair O
and O
Clarke O
2007 O
; O
Koppenhöfer O
and O
Gaugler O
2009 O
; O
Stock O
2015 O
). O
Nematodes O
from O
the O
genus O
Sternainema O
carry O
symbiotic O
bacteria O
in O
a O
specialized O
vesicle O
called O
the O
receptacle, O
which O
is O
placed O
in O
the O
anterior O
part O
of O
the O
gut. O
In O
turn, O
Heterorhabditis O
nematodes, O
which O
do O
not O
have O
such O
a O
specialized O
structure, O
use O
their O
intestinal O
lumen O
to O
harbor O
bacteria O
(Fig. O
1 O
) O
(Bird O
and O
Akhurst O
1983 O
; O
Boemare O
2002 O
; O
Snyder O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
The O
life O
cycle O
of O
all O
EPN O
microsymbionts O
is O
similar O
and O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
three O
phases: O
phoretic O
in O
the O
nematode O
host, O
pathogenic O
in O
the O
insect O
body, O
and O
saprophytic O
in O
the O
insect O
cadaver O
(Ciche O

2007 O
; O
Stock O
and O
Goodrich-Blair O
2008 O
; O
Koppenhöfer O
and O
Gaugler O
2009 O
). O
In O
addition, O
some O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
have O
been O
identified O
as O
opportunistic O
pathogens O
of O
humans; O
however, O
the O
mechanism O
of O
infection O
is O
not O
known O
yet O
(see O
chapter O
7 O
for O
details). O
There O
is O
also O
a O
report O
on O
a O
bacterial O
strain O
classified O
as O
Photorhabdus B-PATH
luminescens, I-PATH
which O
causes O
rare O
neonatal O
bacteremia O
and O
cutaneous O
lesions O
(Dutta O

The O
resistance O
levels O
of O
most O
of O
the O
isolates O
were O
relatively O
low, O
but O
the O
overexpression O
strain O
ATCC O
11845-pLMF03::rpoB O
+ O
constructed O
according O
to O
the O
type O
of O
isolates O
all O
reached O
128 O
μg/mL, O
indicating O
that O
the O
level O
of O
drug O
resistance O
conferred O
by O
the O
rpoB O
mutation O
might O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
strain O
background. O
Second, O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
biological O
evolution, O
the O
replacement O
of O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
in O
a O
strain O
was O
not O
only O
a O
mutation O
of O
one O
amino O
acid O
site. O
The O
amino O
acid O
H531 O
of O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
in O
Pseudomonas O
aeruginosa O
could O
generate O
both O
H531R O
and O
H531Y O
mutations; O
continuous O
screening O
from O
two O
mutations O
was O
able O
to O
get O
the O
same O
site O
of O
the O
new O
mutation O
type O
H531C, O
while O
H531C O
weakened O
part O
of O
the O
H531R O
and O
H531Y O
fitness O
cost O
[ O
27 O
]. O
And O
that O
indicated O
that O
mutation O
from O
the O
wild O
type O
to O
H531C O
required O
a O
step-by-step O
process. O
In O
addition, O
as O
environmental O
conditions O
could O
affect O
protein O
stability O
and O
activity, O
rpoB O
mutations O
might O
affect O
the O
function O
of O
RNAP O
at O
different O
temperatures O
[ O
27 O
, O
28 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
selected O
rpoB O
mutations O
were O
specific O
under O
certain O
environmental O
pressures O
[ O
29 O
, O
30 O
], O
which O
also O
provided O
an O
explanation O
for O
the O
differences O
in O
detected O
rpoB O
mutations. O
Above O
all, O
the O
spontaneous O
mutation O
test O
in O
this O
study O
was O
carried O
out O
on O
solid O
medium O
without O
antibiotics O
at O
37 O
°C O
lacking O
clinically O
specific O
environmental O
pressures, O
making O
all O
mutations O
possible O
to O
survive, O
which O
had O
little O
to O
do O
with O
their O
respective O
fitness. O
Studies O
in O
F. O
psychrophilum O
suggested O
that O
strains O
under O
the O
rifampin O
pressure O
were O
prone O
to O
enrich O
more O
single-nucleotide O
polymorphism, O
which O
would O
be O
associated O
with O
weakened O
virulence O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
types O
of O
rpoB O
mutations O
obtained O
from O
spontaneous O
mutation O
tests O
were O
various, O
while O
the O
types O
identified O
in O
isolates O
were O
relatively O
concentrated. O

However, O
the O
women O
included O
in O
the O
Italian O
study O
visited O
referral O
centers O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
cystitis, O
which O
might O
have O
resulted O
in O
the O
selection O
of O
more O
complicated O
UTIs. O
In O
the O
United O
Kingdom, O
a O
cost O
analysis O
was O
performed O
to O
evaluate O
the O
mean O
monthly O
direct O
UTIs O
costs O
in O
women O
between O
the O
ages O
of O
18 O
and O
70 O
years O
who O
were O
seen O
by O
a O
GP O
or O
a O
nurse O
between O
2005 O
and O
2006 O
from O
the O
NHS O
perspective. O
The O
mean O
monthly O
direct O
UTI O
costs O
were O
estimated O
at O
£30.60 O
when O
the O
UTIs O
were O
treated O
with O
empirical O
antibiotic O
therapy O
and O
£37.10 O
when O
urine O
cultures O
were O
performed O
[ O
45 O
]. O
The O
cost O
differences O
between O
this O
study O
and O
the O
present O
French O
study O
may O
have O
been O
related O
to O
the O
systematic O
one-month O
follow-up O
(with O
no O
differences O
between O
relapse O
and O
reinfection) O
used O
in O
the O
English O
study O
and O
the O
higher O
remuneration O
of O
English O
GPs O
(approximately O
30 O
% O
greater O
than O
that O
of O
French O
GPs O
in O
2008 O
[ O
46 O
]). O
In O
the O
United O
States O
in O
2010, O
the O
annual O
direct O
and O
indirect O
UTI O
cost O
was O
estimated O
at O
$2.3 O
billion O
[ O
47 O
]. O
Considering O
that O
the O
American O
population O
was O
approximately O
five O
times O
greater O
than O
the O
French O
population O
in O
2012, O
the O
American O
cost O
was O
six O
times O
greater O
than O
the O
French O
cost. O
This O
difference O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
costs O
of O
physician O
visits O
and O
diagnostic O
tests, O
which O
are O
three O
to O
ten O
times O
more O
expensive O
in O
the O
United O
States O
than O
in O
France O
[ O
48 O
]. O
Cost-effectiveness O
studies O
have O
found O
that O
most O
cost-effective O
treatment O
is O
the O
empirical O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
that O
are O
effective O
against O
E. O
coli O
[ O
12 O
, O
49 O
, O
50 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
in O
the O
present O
French O
study, O
the O
mean O
UTI O
cost O
due O
to O
wild O
E. O
coli O
was O
not O
significantly O
different O
from O
the O
mean O
UTI O
cost O
due O
to O
antibiotic-resistant O
E. O
coli. O
This O
lack O
of O
a O
difference O
could O
have O
resulted O
from O
our O
use O
of O
systematic O
urine O
analyses. O
Even O
without O
antibiotics, O
20 O
% O
of O
women O
recover O
from O
uncomplicated O
lower O
UTIs O
within O
3 O
days O
and O
26 O
% O
recover O
within O
one O
week O
[ O
41 O
, O
51 O
]. O
The O
effect O
of O
inadequate O
antibiotic O
prescription O
should O
be O
studied O
in O
greater O
detail O
and O
might O
have O
little O
influence O
on O
the O
consumption O
of O
care O
by O
women O
who O
visit O
GPs O
for O
UTIs. O

The O

are O
characterised O
by O
a O
highly O

single O
calcium-binding O

a O

that O
often O

Taken O

up O
the O

used O
to O
classify O

An O
important O
structural O

is O
the O
presence O
of O
one O

more O
lipid-binding O

the O

of O
which O
is O
located O
immediately O

It O
has O

that O

are O
able O
to O
bind O
to O
several O
different O

In O
addition O
to O
their O
associations O
with O

in O

many O

by O
the O

hydrophobic O
motif O
that O
is O
normally O
described O
as O
a O

(see O

although O
such O

would O
require O
that O
the O

the O

Altogether, O
the O

indicate O
that O
suppression O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O

restricts O
fungal O
growth O
and O

According O
to O
farmers O
interviewed, O
barley O
is O
more O
amenable O
to O
no-till O
systems O
without O
herbicides O
than O
many O
other O
crops O
in O
their O
experience. O
Several O
farmers O
growing O
barley O
were O
organic O
dairy O
producers. O
Because O
cattle O
are O
ruminants, O
they O
can O
digest O
barley O
hulls, O
and O
naked O
barley O
is O
not O
as O
important O
for O
their O
farming O
systems. O
These O
producers O
also O
emphasized O
the O
importance O
of O
barley O
for O
producing O
high-quality O
organic O
straw. O
By O
contrast, O
many O
of O
the O
producers O
who O
grow O
barley O
as O
a O
cash O
crop O
do O
not O
harvest O
the O
straw O
but O
will O
instead O
till O
it O
in O
for O
organic O
matter O
or O
plant O
into O
the O
residue, O
which O
serves O
as O
a O
mulch. O
The O
exceptions O
were O
farmers O
in O
straw-deficient O
areas O
with O
either O
high O
concentrations O
of O
dairy O
farms O
or O
near O
suburban O
markets. O
One O
of O
the O
dairy O
producers O
interviewed O
grows O
barley O
as O
an O
intercrop O
with O
peas. O
The O
mixture O
is O
harvested O
before O
the O
grain O
matures O
and O
is O
fed O
as O
green O
chop. O
The O
mixture O
is O
high O
in O
total O
digestible O
nutrients O
and O
he O
noted O
that O
the O
cattle O
find O
it O
highly O
palatable. O
Other O
dairy O
producers O
will O
harvest O
the O
grain O
and O
mix O
it O
on O
farm O
with O
other O
components O
to O
make O
a O
balanced O
ration. O
The O
interview O
responses O
expanded O
on O
the O
survey O
results, O
particularly O
with O
respect O
to O
variety O
selection. O
Several O
talked O
about O
the O
uncertainty O
presented O
by O
climate O
change, O
particularly O
with O
changing O
precipitation O
patterns O
and O
timing O
of O
planting. O
Climate O
change O
was O
also O
thought O
by O
some O
respondents O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
increasing O
disease O
pressure. O
The O
interviews O
took O
place O
after O
a O
particularly O
wet O
season, O
and O
at O
least O
two O
producers O
reported O
partial O
or O
complete O
crop O
failures. O
Rains O
before O
harvest O
resulted O
in O
crops O
that O
were O
too O
wet O
to O
satisfactorily O
harvest. O
Barley—like O
wheat O
in O
the O
USA—has O
low O
operating O
costs, O
high O
capital O
costs, O
and O
tends O
to O
be O
a O
low-margin O
or O
break-even O
crop. O
However, O
when O
overhead O
costs O
were O
factored O
in, O
the O
net O
margin O
was O
slightly O
negative O
given O
the O
relatively O
high O
capital O
investment O
costs. O
Organic O
wheat O
is O
similarly O
a O
low-margin O
crop O
when O
compared O
with O
maize O
and O
soybeans O
(McBride O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
Cost O
and O
return O
data O
are O
summarized O
in O
Table O
3 O
. O
However, O
there O
were O
great O
regional O
differences O
in O
cost O
of O
production O
as O
well O
as O
return O
per O
acre. O

These O
variations O
are O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
the O
higher O
purity O
of O
the O
recombinant O
protein O
compared O
to O
native O
one O
(Table O
2 O
, O
Table O
3 O
). O
Also, O
a O
high O
peroxidase O
activity O
could O
be O
related O
to O
partial O
denaturation O
and O
thus O
a O
more O
accessible O
heme O
in O
the O
non-recombinant O
cyt O
c. O
A O
partial O
denaturation O
can O
involve O
the O
breaking O
of O
the O
methionine O
coordination O
that O
leaves O
the O
heme O
more O
accessible O
for O
catalysis O
[ O
21 O
]. O
However, O
this O
is O
ruled O
out O
by O
the O
UV-spectra O
of O
the O
recombinant O
cyt O
c O
because O
they O
show O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
charge O
transfer O
band O
thus O
indicating O
that O
methionine O
coordination O
is O
intact O

In O
Spade O
mice O
over O
7 O
weeks O
of O
age, O
however, O
we O
observed O
transient O
and, O
in O
three O
recordings, O
repetitive O
Ca O
2+ O
increases O
in O
epidermal O
nerves O
6 O
to O
90 O
min O
before O
the O
epidermal O
nerves O
underwent O
pruning O
(Fig. O
5d–h O
; O
Supplementary O
Movie O
13 O
). O
Occasionally, O
longer-range O
Ca O
2+ O
spikes O
that O
reached O
dermal O
nerves O
were O
also O
observed O
(Fig. O
5d–f O
; O
Supplementary O
Movie O
13 O
). O
The O
Ca O
2+ O
increases O
preceding O
epidermal O
nerve O
pruning O
was O
far O
more O
evident O
in O
the O
adult O
Spade O
mice O
than O
in O
age-matched O
control O
mice O
(Fig. O
5g,h O
), O
whereas O
Ca O
2+ O
increases O
coinciding O
with O
pruning O
were O
similar O
in O
both O
types O
of O
mice O
(Fig. O
5i,j O
). O
By O
contrast, O
in O
young O
Spade O
mice O
at O
4–6 O
weeks O
old, O
Ca O
2+ O
increases O
associated O
with O
epidermal O
nerve O
pruning O
were O
not O
significantly O
different O
from O
those O
in O
young O
control O
mice O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O
5 O
). O
Thus, O
around O
the O
onset O
of O
pathological O
itch, O
aberrant O
Ca O
2+ O
increases O
are O
induced O
in O
epidermal O
nerves O
before O
their O
pruning O
in O
Spade O
mice. O
In O
some O
skin O
areas O
of O
Spade O
mice O
over O
8 O
weeks, O
Ca O
2+ O
concentration O
in O
epidermal O
nerves O
especially O
in O
the O
upper O
epidermal O
region O
was O
remarkably O
elevated O
in O
a O
sustained O
manner O
from O
the O
beginning O
of O
imaging O
(Fig. O
6a O
; O
Supplementary O
Movie O
14 O
). O
In O
some O
nerve O
endings, O
Ca O
2+ O
concentration O
was O
again O
oscillating O
in O
the O
range O
higher O
than O
control O
levels O
(Fig. O
6b O
; O
Supplementary O
Movie O
15 O
). O
Extensive O
fragmentation O
of O
nerve O
fibers O
was O
also O
observed O
in O
these O
skin O
areas O
(Fig. O
6c O
; O
Supplementary O
Movie O
15 O
). O
The O
sustained O
Ca O
2+ O
increases O
in O
epidermal O
nerves O
were O
significant O
in O
the O
Spade O
ear O
skin O
without O
visible O
lesions O
from O
scratching O
(Fig. O
6d O
). O
Nevertheless, O
it O
was O
still O
possible O
that O
the O
Ca O
2+ O
increase O
might O
be O
a O
result O
of O
scratching. O

Histopathologic O
features O
associated O
to O
Cryptosporidium O
infection O
include O
stomach O
infiltrates, O
villus O
lining O
in O
the O
duodenum, O
cryptitis O
caused O
by O
massive O
eosinophils O
concentration, O
and O
epithelial O
apoptosis O
in O
the O
colon O
(Werneck-Silva O
and O
Bedin O
Prado O
2009 O
). O
However, O
most O
of O
these O
findings O
concern O
to O
the O
HIV-positive O
patients. O
The O
cases O
described O
in O
our O
study O
indicate O
that O
coccidian O
parasites O
might O
be O
responsible O
for O
gastrointestinal O
pathology O
resulting O
with O
chronic O
diarrhea O
also O
in O
HIV-negative O
persons. O
Massive O
infections O
should O
be O
treated O
because O
they O
lead O
to O
huge O
intestine O
damage, O
which O
could O
be O
responsible O
for O
prolonged O
even O
life-threatening O
symptoms O
especially O
in O
children, O
teenagers, O
and O
malnourished O
individuals. O
Moreover, O
they O
can O
influence O
on O
gut O
microbiota. O
The O
current O
therapeutic O
options O
for O
cryptosporidiosis O
are O
limited O
and O
only O
partially O
effective. O
In O
two O
out O
of O
three O
described O
cases, O
the O
treatment O
with O
trimethoprim/sulphametoxazole O
was O
insufficient. O
Nitazoxanide O
and O
azithromycin O
have O
better O
effectiveness O
for O
cryptosporidiosis O
treatment O
in O
humans O
(Lee O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
To O
sum O
up, O
Cryptosporidium O
infection O
must O
be O
taken O
under O
consideration O
in O
differential O
diagnosis O
of O
persistent O
diarrhea O
in O
individuals O
without O
HIV O
infection. O
Additionally, O
it O
should O
be O
highlighted O
that O
persistent O
Cryptosporidium B-PATH
hominis I-PATH
infection O
can O
be O
responsible O
for O
enhanced O
lamina O
propria O
and O
submucosa O
alterations O
within O
large O
intestine, O
which O
strictly O
connects O
to O
prolonged O
intestinal O
symptoms O
in O
patients O
without O
HIV O
infection. O
Moreover, O
Cryptosporidium O
infection O
may O
also O
lead O
to O
extraintestinal O
abnormalities, O
i.e., O
extraperitoneal O
lymphadenopathy O
as O
well O
as O
generalized O
arthritis, O
and O
thus, O
patients O
suffering O
from O
such O
symptoms O
should O
be O
carefully O
examined O
to O
detect O
coccidian O
parasites. O

Thus, O
variations O
in O
yield O
of O
the O
metabolites O
could O
be O
encountered O
across O
seasons O
and O
regions O
of O
the O
world O

It O
used O
to O
be O
supposed O
that O
there O
were O
two O
types O
of O
diabetes: O
type-1 O
and O
type-2. O
However, O
the O
idea O
that O
AD O
might O
be O
type-3 O
diabetes O
was O
proposed O
ten O
years O
ago O
(Martins O
et O
al., O
2006 O
). O
Some O
studies O
suggested O
that O
AD O
progresses O
because O
of O
the O
brain O
developing O
resistance O
to O
insulin, O
which O
in O
turn O
prevents O
proper O
lipid O
uptake. O
Over O
time, O
these O
lipids O
build O
up O
in O
the O
brain O
rather O
than O
properly O
absorb, O
which O
results O
in O
increased O
stress O
and O
inflammation, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
symptoms O
usually O
related O
with O
dementia O
(de O
la O
Monte, O
2014 O
; O
Rani O
et O
al., O
2016 O
). O
Given O
the O
evidence O
provided O
by O
animal O
models O
of O
the O
strong O
relationship O
between O
T2DM O
and O
AD. O
When O
the O
authors O
blocked O
the O
path O
of O
insulin O
to O
rats’ O
brains, O
their O
neurons O
deteriorated, O
they O
became O
physically O
confused O
and O
their O
brains O
showed O
all O
the O
signs O
of O
AD. O
Furthermore, O
the O
study O
provided O
proof O
that O
T2DM O
and O
AD O
aggravate O
each O
other O
and O
suggested O
several O
potential O
mechanisms O
underlying O
the O
two O
disorders, O
such O
as, O
Aβ O
clearance O
by O
insulin O
degradation O
enzyme O
(IDE), O
glucose O
metabolism, O
O-GlcNAcylation, O
Aβ O
aggregation O
by O
advanced O
glycation O
end O
products O
(AGEs), O
oxidative O
stress, O
circulating O
cortisol, O
and O
cerebral O
vascular O
insufficiency, O
as O
well O
as O
inflammation, O
and O
aging. O
In O
fact, O
people O
with O
diabetes O
have O
double O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
AD. O
This O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
everyone O
who O
has O
diabetes O
will O
eventually O
develop O
AD, O
or O
that O
all O
people O
with O
AD O
have O
diabetes. O
It O
is O
important O
to O
report O
that O
there O
is O
an O
important O
link O
between O
diabetes O
and O
AD, O
and O
it O
is O
therefore O
common O
that O
pathophysiology O
probably O
constitutes O
a O
major O
underpinning O
of O
late-onset O
sporadic O
AD, O
and O
a O
novel O
therapeutic O
approach O
targeting O
this O
pathological O
process O
could O
contribute O
to O
the O
development O
of O
a O
more O
efficient O
and O
effective O
treatment O
for O
AD O
(Park, O
2011 O
; O
de O

). O
Aging O

65-69 O
years O
up O
to O
30-40% O

(Gatz O

Many O
papers O
on O
evolutionary O
psychology O
are O
published O
outside O
of O
those O
two O
journals. O
Similarly, O
there O
might O
be O
papers O
in O
our O
sample O
which O
have O
a O
different O
focus O
than O
evolutionary O
psychology, O
or O
which O
might O
be O
better O
classified O
as O
relating O
to O
fields O
such O
as O
comparative O
cognition, O
behavioural O
economics, O
linguistics, O
demography, O
or O
anthropology O
among O
others. O
Future O
work O
might O
compare O
one O
journal O
to O
the O
next, O
and O
compare O
across O
a O
sequence O
of O
different O
years, O
to O
determine O
the O
variance O
in O
sample O
diversity. O
Alternatively, O
one O
could O
define O
keywords O
to O
more O
clearly O
delineate O
articles O
covering O
evolutionary O
psychology. O
Further, O
future O
research O
might O
seek O
to O
uncover O
whether O
different O
research O
areas O
within O
evolutionary O
psychology O
are O
more O
or O
less O
reliant O
upon O
non-diverse O
samples, O
and O
how O
this O
corresponds O
to O
their O
development O
as O
a O
research O
area. O
Exploratory O
studies O
might O
well O
choose O
to O
focus O
on O
easily O
accessible O
samples O
such O
as O
undergraduates O
to O
test O
their O
initial O
ideas, O
whereas O
more O
mature O
research O
areas O
ought O
to O
seek O
to O
diversify O
their O
samples O
further O
in O
order O
to O
test O
the O
generalisability O
of O
their O
findings. O
Even O
within O
specific O
research O
areas, O
some O
topics O
have O
been O
studied O
in O
more O
diverse O
worldwide O
samples O
than O
others; O
for O
instance, O
sex O
differences O
in O
partner O
preferences O
draws O
from O
data O
from O
many O
cultures O
(e.g. O
Buss O
1989 O
; O
Shackelford O
et O
al. O
2005 O
), O
whereas O
research O
on O
ovulatory O
shifts O
in O
partner O
preferences O
very O
much O
rests O
upon O
studies O
carried O
out O
in O
English-speaking O
WEIRD O
countries O
(Gildersleeve O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
Our O
survey O
does O
not O
present O
cause O
for O
despair. O
In O
terms O
of O
participant O
diversity, O
evolutionary O
psychology O
does O
rely O
on O
WEIRD, O
student O
samples O
less O
heavily O
than O
some O
fields O
(Apicella O
and O
Barrett O
2016 O
; O
Kurzban O
2013 O
). O
However, O
this O
is O
perhaps O
in O
part O
because O
of O
the O
discipline’s O
need O
for O
cross-cultural O
surveys O
to O
validate O
theories O
that O
claim O
to O
purport O
to O
humans O
as O
a O
species. O
Evolutionary O
psychology O
has O
a O
greater O
need O
for O
cross-cultural O
replications O
than O
other O
disciplines, O
such O
as O
those O
focussed O
around O
basic O
psychophysics O
where O
we O
might O
more O
easily O
assume O
universal O
underlying O
mechanics, O
or O
more O
descriptive O
research O
approaches O
that O
aim O
to O
uncover O
behaviour O
in O
culturally-specific O
environments, O
such O
as O
the O
workplace O
or O
social O
media O
sites. O

Over O
99% O
of O
microbiota O
in O
the O
GI O
tract O
are O
anaerobic O
bacteria, O
with O
archaebacterial, O
protozoa, O
fungi, O
and O
other O
microorganisms O
making O
up O
the O
remainder O
(Hill O
et O
al., O
2014 O
). O
These O
GI O
microbiota O
play O
many O
important O
roles O
in O
physiological O
homeostasis O
and O
metabolism, O
conferring O
many O
health O
benefits O
on O
the O
host O
organism, O
including O
pathogen O
displacement, O
immune O
system O
development, O
barrier O
fortification, O
vitamin O
production O
and O
nutrient O
absorption, O
and O
is O
often O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
‛forgotten O
organ’ O
as O
a O
result O
of O
what O
it O
is O
(O’Hara O
and O
Shanahan, O
2006 O
). O
Consequently, O
there O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
impetus O
for O
the O
comprehensive O
understanding O
of O
the O
complete O
pathological O
function, O
genetic O
information O
and O
functional O
diversity O
of O
the O
gut O

that O
may O
lead O
to O
clinical O
AD O
and O
the O
discovery O
of O
variable O
risk O
factors O
(Clemente O
et O
al., O
2012 O
). O
In O
this O
review, O
we O
examine O
the O
roles O
of O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
in O
the O
maintenance O
of O
health, O
inflammation O
process; O
and O
how O
it O
is O
implicated O
in O
acquired O
metabolic O
diseases O
and O
aging-related O
morbidity; O
highlighting O
the O
dementia, O
particularly O
in O
AD O
regulation. O
Finally, O
we O
discuss O
the O
potential O
modification O
to O
providing O
clinical O
benefit O
of O
the O
gut O
microbiome O
and O
other O
methods O
for O
AD O
avoidance. O
Brain-Gut O
axis O
Bidirectional O
communications O
between O
the O
gut O
tract O
and O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS)—the O
braingut O
axis—occur O
in O
both O
sickness O
and O
health. O
Recently, O
a O
role O
of O
the O
enteric O
microbiota O
which O
count O
as O
both O
commensal O
and O
pathogenic O
organisms O
(such O
as O
Bifidobacterium O
and O
Escherichia), O
in O
the O
brain–gut O
axis O
interactions O
was O
essentially O
identified O
(Grenham O
et O
al., O
2011 O
). O
The O
gut O
microbiota O
assists O
a O
number O
of O
everyday O
functions O
in O
the O
brain, O
including O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal O
(HPA) O
axis O
activation O
state. O
The O
release O
of O
cortisol O
as O
a O
result O
of O
HPA O
axis O
activation O
can O
in O
turn O
govern O
the O
activation O
state O
of O
brain O
microglia, O
and O
effect O
cytokine O
release O
as O
well O
as O
attracting O
of O
monocytes O
from O
the O
periphery O
to O
the O
brain. O

To O
determine O
whether O
Pla O
properly O
localizes O
to O
the O
outer O
membrane O
and O
exhibits O
enzymatic O
activity O
when O
expressed O
in O
Pestoides O
F, O
we O
conducted O
a O
Plg O
activation O
assay O
and O
found O
that O
Pestoides O
F O
carrying O
pPCP1 O
showed O
similar O
levels O
of O
Plg O
activation O
compared O
with O
CO92 O
( O
Fig. O
3c O
). O
Furthermore, O
additional O
Pla O
activity O
of O
Pestoides O
F O
was O
demonstrated O
by O
the O
similar O
efficiency O
as O
CO92 O
in O
the O
degradation O
of O
FasL O
( O
Supplementary O
Fig. O
3c O
). O
The O
Pla O
activity O
of O
these O
Pestoides O
F O
or O
CO92 O
strains O
was O
subsequently O
eliminated O
in O
the O
isogenic O
Δpla O
mutants O
( O
Fig. O
3c O
; O
Supplementary O
Fig. O
3c O
). O
Together, O
these O
data O
show O
that O
the O
ancestral O
strain O
Pestoides O
F O
can O
harbour O
pPCP1 O
and O
produce O
proteolytically O
active O
Pla, O
indicating O
that O
additional O
changes O
to O
the O
Y. O
pestis O
genome O
were O
not O
necessary O
for O
the O
expression, O
production O
and O
activity O
of O
this O
essential O
virulence O
factor. O
Pla O
is O
sufficient O
for O
Pestoides O
F O
to O
cause O
pneumonic O
plague O
Pla O
is O
necessary O
for O
the O
progression O
of O
pneumonic O
plague O
in O
modern O
lineages O
of O
Y. O
pestis; O
therefore, O
we O
tested O
whether O
the O
acquisition O
of O
Pla O
by O
Pestoides O
F O
was O
all O
that O
was O
required O
for O
one O
of O
the O
earliest O
existing O
ancestral O
strains O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
to O
cause O
primary O
pneumonic O
plague. O
On O
introduction O
to O
mice O
via O
the O
i.n. O
route, O
we O
found O
that O
Pestoides O
F O
carrying O
pPCP1 O
was O
able O
to O
grow O
to O
high O
levels O
in O
the O
lungs O
and O
cause O
the O
death O
of O
the O
animals O
within O
3–3.5 O
days, O
to O
the O
same O
extent O
and O

as O
wild-type O
Y. O
pestis O

(not O
statistically O

). O
This O
increase O
in O
bacterial O
burden O
within O
the O

is O
Pla O
dependent O
in O
both O
Pestoides O

and O

as O

Probably, O
in O

the O

on O
the O

Lysosomal O
acidification O

are O
much O
lower O
in O

than O
in O

and O
such O
reduced O

and O
increased O
presentation O
on O

[ O

Because O
the O

is O
precisely O

on O
the O

during O

our O
last O

concerned O
the O

Taken O

accompanied O
by O

The O

that O

negatively O

positively, O
respectively, O
influence O
the O

S. O

We O
also O
provide O
strong O
experimental O

human O
cellular O

BC200 O
RNA O
[ O

], O
suggesting O
a O
role O
for O
this O
primate-specific O
RNA O
in O
POLR3-HLD O
pathophysiology O
[ O
10 O
]. O
BC200 O
RNA O
has O
a O
functional O
analog O
in O
mouse, O
Bc1 O
RNA, O
which O
is O
also O
synthesized O
by O
Pol O

While O
both O
transcripts O
play O
a O
similar O
role O
in O
translational O
regulation, O
they O
have O
different O
evolutionary O
origins O
[ O
10 O
] O
and O
recent O
evidence O
indicates O
that O
BC200 O
RNA O
is O
also O
involved O
in O
mRNA O
splicing O
and O
stability O
[ O
11 O
, O
12 O
]. O

However, O
in O
our O
study, O
there O
were O
more O
workers O
and O
less O
non-economically O
active O
persons O
than O
in O
the O
general O
population. O
This O
is O
concordant O
with O
the O
French O
inequalities O
of O
health O
care O
recourse: O
unemployed O
and O
retired O
persons O
seek O
less O
care O
than O
economically O
active O
persons O
[ O
38 O
]. O
Second, O
the O
costs O
calculated O
in O
this O
study O
were O
for O
women O
who O
visited O
GPs O
and O
not O
for O
the O
general O
population. O
The O
estimation O
of O
the O
costs O
of O
UTIs O
among O
the O
general O
population O
would O
have O
required O
the O
estimations O
of O
the O
costs O
of O
women O
who O
visited O
hospital O
emergencies O
departments O
and O
specialists O
(i.e., O
urologists O
and O
gynecologists). O
Third, O
the O
data O
used O
to O
estimate O
the O
non-medical O
direct O
costs O
(i.e., O
time O
lost O
and O
monetary O
expenses), O
intangible O
costs O
(i.e., O
loss O
of O
well-being O
for O
the O
patient O
and O
her O
close O
family O
and O
friends) O
and O
presenteeism O
costs O
(i.e., O
the O
loss O
of O
productivity O
due O
to O
a O
UTI O
while O
the O
patient O
was O
working) O
were O
not O
available. O
Fourth, O
the O
friction O
cost O
method O
was O
chosen O
to O
determinate O
the O
indirect O
costs. O
The O
cost’s O
results O
should O
be O
interpreted O
with O
caution O
because O
this O
method O
is O
controversial O
in O
cases O
of O
short-term O
disease. O
The O
human O
capital O
approach O
overstates O
the O
production O
lost O
because O
the O
sick O
employee’s O
colleagues O
can O
offset O
the O
absence O
via O
increased O
productivity O
[ O
27 O
]. O
Consequently, O
the O
estimates O
of O
friction O
costs O
should O
represent O
the O
upper O
bound O
of O
the O
estimates O
of O
the O
short-term O
indirect O
costs O
[ O
27 O
]. O
However, O
in O
cases O
involving O
teamwork, O
the O
absence O
of O
an O
employee O
can O
also O
reduce O
the O
production O
of O
several O
employees O
[ O
39 O
]. O
Fifth, O
although O
the O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
exclude O
the O
costs O
of O
reinfection, O
the O
women O
who O
were O
symptomatic O
at O
2 O
weeks O
might O
have O
experienced O
a O
reinfection O
between O
the O
second O
and O
the O
eighth O
weeks, O
and O
these O
costs O
were O
taken O
into O
account O
because O
differences O
between O
relapses O
and O
reinfections O
could O
not O
be O
identified O
during O
this O
period. O
Sixth, O
the O
costs O
of O
long-term O
symptomatic O
failure O
(i.e., O
the O
persistence O
of O
symptoms O
after O
8 O
weeks) O
could O
not O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
because O
the O
follow-up O
period O
stopped O
after O
8 O
weeks. O

However, O
to O
verify O
this O
hypothesis O
further O
investigations O
are O
required O
to O
determine O
the O
direct O
effect O
of O
cathepsins O

therefore, O
we O

the O
ability O

cells O
to O
process O
exogenously-derived O

We O
used O
a O

DQ-OVA, O
conjugated O
with O
the O

(BODIPY, O

However, O
early O
sensitization O
and O
challenge O
with O
Ova O
followed O
by O
infection O
with O
RSV O
induced O
a O
2.6 O
fold O
increase O
in O
AHR O
over O
SAL O
controls O
and O
a O
2 O
fold O
increase O
over O
Ova O
alone O
(Figure O
2A O
). O
The O
enhanced O
AHR O
coincided O
with O
increased: O
1) O
total O
BAL O
cellularity O
(increases O
were O
specifically O
observed O
in O
eosinophil O
and O

numbers); O
2) O
pulmonary O

in O
both O
the O
perivascular O
and O
peribronchial O
regions O
of O
the O
lungs; O
3) O
mucus O

and O

4) O
elevated O
levels O
of O
TNF-α, O
IFN-γ, O
IL-5, O
and O
IL-2 O
and O
airway O
collagen O
deposition; O
and O
5) O
subepithelial O
fibrosis. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
pulmonary O
remodeling O
events O
are O
occurring O
in O
weanling O
mice O
exposed O
to O
allergen O
followed O
by O
RSV O
infections O
and, O
furthermore, O
that O
these O
exposures O
synergistically O
enhance O
pulmonary O
pathology O
and O
physiology. O
In O
fact, O
preliminary O
data O
suggest O
that O
AHR O
is O
prolonged O
only O
in O
the O
OOR O
group O
(&gt; O
4 O
weeks O
post O
infection), O
whereas O
AHR O
in O
the O
OVA O
and O
ROO O
groups O
was O
no O
longer O
significantly O
different O
from O
SAL O
controls O
forty-eight O
hours O
after O
the O
last O
allergen O
challenge. O
Rarely, O
in O
humans O
or O
mice, O
is O
eosinophilia O
associated O
with O
primary O
RSV O
infection. O
However, O
RSV O
infection O
in O
combination O
with O
Ova O
sensitization O
and O
challenge O
resulted O
in O
significant O
pulmonary O
eosinophilia O
in O
both O
the O
pulmonary O

and O
BAL O

(OVA: O

for O

We O

a O

on O

account O

However, O
our O

not O

the O
presence O
of O
Lys-72 O

(Additional O

Vidal O

Lemoine O
(1970) O
provided O
some O
insights O
on O
Hmong O

[ O

Plant O
denomination O
in O
Hmong O
follows O
the O
same O
general O

as O
in O

or O
Lao O

where O
names O
are O
formed O
by O
one O
generic O
word O
followed O
by O
specificative(s) O
term(s). O
According O
to O
these O
authors, O
the O
generic O
term O
refers O
to O
the O
plant O
biological O
type O
(hmab: O
vine, O
pos: O
thorny, O
ntoo: O

or O

In O
this O

386 O
different O

were O
recorded. O
Among O
these, O
60% O
(236 O
names) O
include O
a O
generic O
term, O
which O
display O
a O
much O
greater O
variability O
than O
previously O
noted O
by O
Vidal, O
as O
they O
referred O
to O
a O
specific O
part O
of O
plant O
(nblooj: O
leaf, O
paj: O
flower, O
txiv: O
fruit, O
qhaus: O
rhizome, O
cag: O

pos: O
thorn), O
the O
medicinal O
use O
of O
the O
plant O
(tshuaj: O

its O

categories O
(zaub: O

vegetable, O
qos: O
edible O

or O
its O
cultivated O

(vaj: O
from O

Also, O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
this O

In O
our O

we O
avoid O
an O

due O
to O
the O

the O

be O
ceased O
after O

Ultimately, O
only O

of O
the O

to O
the O
novel O

is O
a O
vital O
option O
(possibly O
including O

Reproductive O
capacity: O
in O
temperate O

a O
wild O
A. O
mellifera O
colony O
will, O
if O
circumstances O
allow, O
reproduce O
in O
spring O
or O
summer O
by O
producing O
a O
prime O
swarm O
and O
rear O
new O
queens O
in O
the O
remaining O
part O
of O
the O
colony O
(some O
of O
which O
will O
leave O
in O
after O
swarms). O
We O
follow O
this O
natural O
development O
of O
colonies O
during O
the O
season: O
our O
colonies O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
reproduce O
(produce O
drones O
and O
swarm O
cells) O
when O
the O
colonies O
choose O
to. O
However, O
because O
we O
aim O
to O
derive O
four O
offspring O
colonies O
(each O
with O
a O
virgin O
queen O
from O
the O
mother O
colony) O
we O
avoid O
losing O
swarms O
by O
making O
an O
artificial O
swarm O
just O
before O
natural O
swarming O
would O
commence. O
By O
removing O
the O
queen O
(in O
an O
artificial O

the O
production O
of O
new O

is O
synchronized. O

To O

However, O
during O

we O
observed O
a O
more O

of O
the O

In O
these O

the O

also O
reduced O
from O

Moreover, O
the O

was O
strongly O
reduced O
to O

The O

further O
suggests O
that O
the O
growth O
impairment O
of O
this O

is O
due O
to O
a O
reduced O

on O
the O

Meanwhile, O
the O
Wixaritari O
named O

with O
a O

such O
as O

or O
A. O

or O
wakanari O
(Marasmius O

or O
with O
two O

such O
as O
utuxa O
yekwá O
(Volvariella O

utuxa O
being O
their O
name O
for O
Ipomea O
intrapilosa. O
When O
a O
binomial O
name O
was O

the O
first O
word O
was O
related O
to O
the O
plant O
or O
animal O
association, O
and O
the O
second O
to O
the O
form, O
although O
the O
order O
was O
reversed O
in O
some O
cases, O
with O
the O
first O
word O
referring O
to O
morphology O
and O
the O
second O
to O
colour. O
The O
names O
of O
mushrooms O
considered O
toxic O
were O
accompanied O
by O
the O
epithet O
‘itaikarieya, O
from O
‘itaikari, O
which O
means O
essence, O
spirit, O
or O
ghost, O
such O
as O
yekwá O
‘itaikarieya O
(A. O

or O
kutsiyari O
after O
Kutsi, O
who O
was O
the O
grandmother O

and O
first O
woman O
in O

who O
germinated O

(Perrin O

). O
These O
concepts O
lack O
a O
literal O

thus O
the O
Wixaritari O
have O
referred O
to O
these O
mushrooms O
in O
Spanish O
as O
hongos O
de O
Dios O
(mushrooms O
from O

Some O
mushroom O
names O
used O
by O
mestizos O
were O
introduced O
by O
the O
Wixaritari. O
Cantharellus O
cibarius O
was O
called O
flores O
(flowers), O
which O
is O
the O
literal O
translation O
of O
the O
Wixarika O
name, O
tuutuxi. O
This O
name O
and O
the O
use O
of O
this O
mushroom O
spread O
from O
the O
Wixaritari O
to O
the O
mestizos O
during O
the O
government O
campaign O
to O
eradicate O

in O
the O

many O
years O
in O

communities. O
When O
selling O
Amanita O

the O
Wixaritari O
translated O
the O
name O
yekwá O
to O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
clinical O

a O
question O
that O
arises O
regarding O
the O
degree O
of O
similarity O
between O
the O
microbiomes O
of O
humans O
and O
laboratory O
mice. O
Although O
a O
direct O
comparison O
between O
datasets O
from O
different O
studies O
can O
be O
blurred O
by O
differences O
in O
analysis O
platforms O
and O
protocols, O
a O
general O
consensus O
exists O
that O
on O
a O
phylum O
through O
family O
level, O
the O
microbiomes O
of O
SPF O
mice O
and O
humans O
are O
similar O
with O
both O
species O
being O
predominantly O
colonized O
by O
Bacteroidetes O
and O
Firmicutes O
[ O
70 O
, O
71 O
]. O
Comparison O
between O
datasets O
on O
a O
deeper O
taxonomic O
level O
is O
challenging O
because O
of O
limited O
representation O
of O
microbial O
genes O
in O
the O
current O
databases O
causing O
difficulties O
with O
genus, O
species O
and O
strain O
level O
annotation. O
A O
study O
comparing O
microbial O
metagenomes O
of O
humans O
and O
SPF O
mice O
of O
different O
genetic O
backgrounds O
and O
housed O
in O
different O
facilities O
showed O
that O
only O
4% O
of O
microbial O
gene O
sequences O
were O
shared O
between O
humans O
and O
mice. O
Despite O
that O
discordance, O
functional O
annotation O
of O
the O
mouse O
and O
human O
microbiomes O
using O
the O
KEGG O
database O
revealed O
that O
85% O
of O
the O
annotated O
gene O
orthologs O
were O
shared O
between O
mouse O
and O
human O
microbiomes O
[ O
72 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
murine O
organism O
as O
a O
host O
appears O
to O
have O
similar O
functional O
requirements O
for O
the O
commensal O
microbiota, O
which O
makes O
it O
an O
appropriate O
recipient O
of O
human O
microbiota O
for O
studying O
its O

on O

physiology. O
A O
high O
value O
of O
GF O
mice O
in O

is O
their O
utility O
in O

Indeed, O

was O
defined O

at O

three O

The O
data O

were O
performed O
using O
the O

However, O
the O
high O
infection O
rates O
in O
moose O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
ecotype O
I O
in O
questing O
ticks O
in O
a O
region O
without O
red O
deer, O
but O
with O
moose O
present, O
is O
at O
least O
suggestive O
that O
moose O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
transmission O
of O
both O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum. O
Presence O
of O
bacterial O
DNA O
in O
tissue O
samples O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
document O
the O
viability O
or O
infectivity O
of O
a O
pathogen O
in O
the O
host. O
Culturing O
is O
the O
gold O
standard O
for O
proving O
the O
viability O
or O
infectiousness O
of O
microorganisms, O
but O
this O
is O
costly, O
time-consuming, O
difficult O
for O
many O
tick-borne O
pathogens, O
and O
generally O
suffers O
from O
a O
low O
sensitivity O
[ O
36 O
]. O
PCR-array O
also O
has O
its O
limits, O
and O
there O
might O
be O
presence O
of O
bacteria O
below O
detectable O
concentrations O
[ O
37 O
]. O
Also, O
vector O
competence O
requires O
larval O
(or O
nymphal) O
ticks O
to O
be O
infected O
from O
their O
blood O
meal O
and O
passing O
viable O
pathogens O
at O
the O
nymphal O
(or O
adult O
female) O
stage O
to O
a O
novel O
host. O
However, O
since O
many O
studies O
are O
indicating O
I. O
ricinus O
as O
the O
vector O
and O
cervids O
as O
potential O
hosts O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
DNA-based O
detection O
provides O
useful O
information O
when O
aiming O
to O
elucidate O
the O
different O
enzootic O
cycles. O
There O
are, O
however, O
several O
other O
difficult O
issues O
in O
determining O
circulation O
and O
enzootic O
cycles O
of O
pathogens. O
Adaptations O
of O
bacteria O
to O
specific O
host O
groups O
require O
mutations O
in O
coding O
genes, O
but O
many O
mutations O
are O
neutral O
and O
single O
mutation O
sequence O
dissimilarity O
is O
not O
sufficient O
in O
the O
meaning O
of O
ecotype O
characterization O
or O
bacterial O
speciation O
[ O
38 O
]. O
That O
we O
found O
both O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
in O
moose, O
can O
be O
seen O
as O
evidence O
that O
ecotype O
are O
not O
entirely O
host-specific O
and O
have O
overlapping O
niches. O
The O
distinction O
between O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
are O
less O
marked O
than O
the O
distinction O
between O
ecotype O
I/II O
and O
the O
other O
two O
ecotypes, O
involving O
many O
different O
ruminant O
hosts. O
The O
ankA O
gene O
identifies O
some O
of O
the O
same O
correlation O
to O
host O
species O
as O
groEL O
[ O

]. O

While O
there O
had O
previously O
been O
a O
strong O
focus O
on O
internal O
validity, O
for O
example, O
focussing O
on O
questions O
such O
as O
whether O
confounding O
can O
be O
effectively O
ruled O
out O
in O
randomised O
controlled O
trials, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
call O
to O
also O
remember O
the O
importance O
of O
external O
validity O
(can O
we O
generalise O
the O
findings O
from O
this O
trial?). O
An O
obvious O
issue O
with O
relying O
on O
WEIRD, O
student O
and/or O
online O
samples O
would O
be O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
any O
conclusions O
would O
hold O
in O
different O
populations O
(Henrich O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Henry O
2008 O
; O
Sue O
1999 O
). O
Even O
more O
fundamentally, O
and O
before O
making O
causal O
inferences O
about O
other O
populations, O
researchers O
face O
the O
more O
basal O
problem O
of O
knowing O
whether O
they O
are O
measuring O
the O
same O
‘thing’ O
in O
different O
populations. O
This O
issue O
is O
well-understood O
in O
the O
field O
of O
psychometrics O
and O
has O
led O
to O
the O
development O
of O
measurement O
techniques O
and O
tests O
to O
examine O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
constructs O
are O
measured O
consistently O
across O
cultures O
(Heine O
et O
al. O
2002 O
; O
Hui O
and O
Triandis O
1985 O
; O
Nasif O
et O
al. O
1991 O
; O
Poortinga O
1989 O
; O
Van O
de O
Vijver O
and O
Leung O
1997 O
). O
We O
did O
not O
explicitly O
assess O
how O
many O
papers O
established O
equivalence O
of O
measurement O
between O
different O
samples, O
as O
we O
focused O
on O
the O
samples. O
Our O
standard O
psychological O
instruments, O
often O
developed O
by O
researchers O
working O
within O
WEIRD O
settings, O
may O
limit O
the O
generalisability O
of O
research O
findings O
(Ceci O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Konečni O
2010 O
; O
Rochat O
2010 O
). O
We O
therefore O
call O
for O
more O
research O
explicitly O
establishing O
that O
the O
same O
‘thing’ O
is O
measured O
in O
different O
populations. O
Depending O
on O
the O
sampling O
scheme, O
broadening O
the O
research O
to O
non-WEIRD O
populations O
could O
also O
give O
rise O
to O
problems O
such O
as O
non-independence O
(Mace O
and O
Pagel O
1994 O
; O
Naroll O
1965 O
; O
Pollet O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Ross O
and O
Homer O
1976 O
), O
which O
then O
would O
need O
to O
be O
addressed. O
We O
do O
not O
discuss O
these O
issues O
in O
further O
detail O
here, O
as O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
they O
matter O
could O
differ O
on O
design O
(experiment/correlational), O
covariates O
and O
research O
question. O
For O

for O
many O
psychophysical O
studies, O
and O
also O
evolutionary O
psychological O
studies O
(Tybur O
et O
al. O

the O
focus O
is O
on O
within-individual O
differences. O

These O

Introduction O
Zebrafish O
Danio O
rerio O
is O
a O
well-established, O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
widely O
used O
vertebrate O
model O
organisms O
in O
biomedical, O
developmental O
and O
genetic O
research O
1 O
mostly O
due O
to O
its O
small O
size, O
ease O
of O
culture, O
high O
fecundity, O
transparent O
embryos, O
70% O
homology O
between O
the O
zebrafish O
and O
human O
genomes, O
as O
well O
as O
good O
annotation O
of O
the O
genome O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
With O
extensive O
studies O
utilizing O
this O
model O
fish, O
several O
thousands O
of O
transgenic O
lines O
of O
zebrafish O
have O
been O
created O
by O
molecular O
biology O
tools O
(such O
as O
ZFNs, O
TALENs, O
CRISPR/Cas9) O
during O
the O
recent O
decades O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Furthermore, O
as O
the O
molecular O
methods O
are O
improved O
and O
refined O
along O
with O
the O
increasing O
needs O
in O
experimental O
designs, O
the O
number O
of O
transgenic O
lines O
is O
only O
going O
to O
increase. O
This O
trend O
is O
leading O
to O
great O
concerns O
in O
the O
storage O
and O
maintenance O
of O
these O
transgenic O
lines. O
Current O
practices O
are O
mostly O
limited O
only O
to O
keeping O
breeding O
colonies O
which O
requires O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
space, O
is O
labor- O
and O
cost-demanding, O
but O
is O
also O
vulnerable O
to O
pathogen O
infections O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
Therefore, O
there O
is O
a O
great O
need O
for O
improving O
storage O
conditions O
for O
such O
valuable O
genetic O
resources. O
Cryopreservation O
is O
a O
method O
that O
allows O
the O
storage O
of O
genetic O
resources O
for O
an O
indefinite O
period O
of O
time O
in O
liquid O
nitrogen. O
Sperm O
cryopreservation O
protocols O
were O
developed O
for O
several O
hundreds O
of O
fish O
species O
so O
far O
(reviewed O
by O
Asturiano O
et O
al. O
5 O
). O
However, O
there O
is O
a O
great O
shortcoming O
of O
this O
method O
since O
so O
far O
only O
spermatozoa O
can O
be O
successfully O
cryopreserved O
in O
fish, O
and O
effective O
methods O
for O
freezing O
of O
eggs O
and O
embryos O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
developed O
due O
to O
their O
high O
yolk O
content O
and O
structural O
complexity. O
Even O
though O
some O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
in O
cryopreservation O
of O
zebrafish O
embryos O
6 O
, O
these O
methods O
still O
do O
not O
lead O
to O
the O
production O
of O
functional O
embryos O
which O
will O
be O
able O
to O
reconstitute O
a O
whole O
zebrafish O
line. O

The O

were O
uniquely O

Etiology O
Genetics O
The O
mode O
of O
inheritance O
for O
A-T O
is O
autosomal O
recessive. O
A-T O
is O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
ATM O
(ataxia O
telangiectasia, O
mutated) O
gene O
which O
was O
cloned O
by O
Savitsky O
et O
al. O
in O
1995 O
[ O
89 O
]. O
ATM O
is O
located O
on O
human O
chromosome O
11q22-q23 O
[ O
90 O
] O
and O
is O
made O
up O
of O
66 O
exons O
(four O
non-coding O
and O
62 O
coding) O
spanning O
150 O
kb O
of O
genomic O
DNA. O
Genotype O
/ O
phenotype O
correlations O
The O
ATM O
gene O
is O
large, O
and O
although O
certain O
populations O
contain O
a O
higher O
frequency O
of O
identical O
mutations O
due O
to O
the O
founder O
effect O
[ O
91 O
, O
92 O
], O
there O
is O
no O
one O
area O
of O
the O
gene O
especially O
susceptible O
to O
mutation. O
Mutations O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
the O
proximal, O
central O
and O
distal O
regions O
of O
the O
human O
ATM O
gene O
[ O
92 O
]. O
These O
include O
primarily O
nonsense O
mutations O
and O
frame O
shifts O
resulting O
from O
insertions O
and O
deletions, O
but O
also O
missense O
and O
leaky O
splice-site O
mutations. O
Compound O
heterozygosity O
is O
common O
[ O
93 O
]. O
In O
1998, O
a O
genotype/phenotype O
analysis O
was O
performed O
on O
a O
small O
cohort O
of O
individuals O
who O
had O
less O
severe O
clinical O
presentations O
of O
A-T O
[ O
94 O
]. O
Subsequently, O
other O
analyses O
of O
genotype/phenotype O
correlations O
in O
disease O
severity O
and O
in O
the O
development O
of O

were O
performed O
on O
larger O
A-T O
cohorts O
([ O
47 O
, O
95 O
, O
96 O
] O
and O
reviewed O
in O
[ O
97 O
]). O
Briefly, O
the O
majority O
of O
ATM O
mutations O
are O
truncating O
[ O
98 O
, O
99 O
], O
creating O
highly O
unstable O
protein O
fragments. O
In O
such O
cases, O
ATM O
protein O
cannot O
be O
detected O
by O
western O

and O
ATM O
kinase O

is O
not O
observed. O
Individuals O
who O
possess O
these O
mutations O
have O
a O
classic O
clinical O
presentation O
of O

the O

of O
their O

follows O
a O

Figs O

from O
Mediterranean O
regions, O
are O
among O
the O
earliest O
fruit O
consumed O
by O
man O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
The O
development O
of O
fig O
fruit O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
three O
stages; O
stage O
III, O
characterized O
by O
the O
fruit’s O
rapid O
increment O
in O
size, O
softening, O
color O
change O
and O
sugar O
accumulation, O
is O
the O
main O
phase O
of O
fruit-quality O
formation, O
and O
is O
much O
shorter O
than O
stages O
I O
or O
II, O
lasting O
only O
3–10 O
days O
under O
different O
growing O
temperatures O
[ O
3 O
– O
5 O
]. O
When O
the O
figs O
reach O
the O
more O
advanced O
ripening O
level—the O
tree-ripe O
(TR) O
stage, O
which O
can O
be O
regarded O
as O
complete O
physiological O
ripeness—the O
fruit O
are O
at O
their O
heaviest O
with O
highest O
soluble O
solids O
content, O
soft O
texture O
and O
best O
flavor. O
A O
consumer O
preference O
study O
demonstrated O
that O
most O
consumers O
are O
more O
willing O
to O
accept O
figs O
of O
TR O
quality O
than O
those O
of O
commercial-ripe O
(CR) O
quality O
[ O
4 O
]. O
However, O
due O
to O
the O
biological O
limitations O
of O
rapidly O
declining O
fruit O
texture, O
desiccation O
and O
phytopathogen O
infection O
[ O
6 O
], O
fresh O
figs O
are O
usually O
harvested O
at O
the O
CR O
stage, O
before O
they O
are O
fully O
ripe. O
Structurally, O
the O
fig O
fruit O
is O
mainly O
composed O
of O
an O
inflorescence—flowers O
and O
receptacle. O
The O
receptacle O
forms O
the O
boundary O
of O
the O
flower O
fruitlets, O
the O
exocarp O
or O
pericarp O
of O
the O
fig O
in O
horticultural O
terms. O
As O
ripening O
proceeds, O
the O
skin O
color O
of O
the O
receptacle O
changes, O
providing O
an O
important O
source O
of O
anthocyanins O
[ O
7 O
– O
9 O
]; O
sugars O
accumulate O
in O
the O
receptacle O
and O
the O
texture O
softens, O
constituting O
the O
edible O
part O
of O
the O
fig O
fruit. O
The O
receptacle O
is O
also O
a O
major O
tissue O
for O
latex O
production O
by O
laticiferous O
cells; O
latex O
has O
a O
protective O
function O
against O
insects O
and O
fungi O
[ O
10 O
], O
but O
a O
negative O
effect O
on O
fig O
taste. O

Another O
study O
demonstrated O
that O
three O
AMT1-type O
members, O
TaAMT1;1a, O
TaAMT1;1b, O
and O
TaAMT1;3a, O
were O
specifically O
induced O
in O
the O
compatible O
interaction O
between O
wheat O
and O
stem O
rust O
fungus O
(Puccinia O
graminis O
f. O
sp. O
tritici, O
Pgt) O
but O
not O
in O
the O
incompatible O
interaction. O
Additionally, O
wheat O
plants O
grown O
with O
NH O
4 O
+ O
were O
more O
vulnerable O
to O
Pgt O
than O
plants O
under O
N-free O
conditions, O
indicating O
that O
ammonium O
transport O
in O
root O
mediated O
by O
AMT1-type O
transporters O
may O
facilitate O
the O
infection O
of O
wheat O
stem O
rust O
[ O
12 O
]. O
While, O
the O
role O
of O
AMT2-type O
transporters O
in O
wheat-rust O
interaction O
is O
not O
clear. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
the O
increased O
expression O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O
during O
Pst O
infection O
was O
expected O
to O
accelerate O
the O
ammonium O
translocation O
from O
intercellular O
space O
to O
mesophyll O
cells. O
However, O
the O
result O
showed O
that O
ammonium O
concentrations O
in O
the O
aerial O
part O
of O
wheat O
after O
Pst O
infection O
declined, O
which O
may O
be O
attributed O
to O
immediate O
assimilation O
of O
excess O
ammonium O
into O
amino O
acids O
[ O
26 O
]. O
Transcriptional O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
the O
single O
gene O
encoding O
AMT O
in O
Pst O
was O
downregulated O
during O
wheat O
infection, O
while O
the O
genes O
encoding O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
were O
upregulated, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
main O
form O
of O
nitrogen O
uptake O
by O
Pst O
from O
the O
host O
is O
amino O
acids O
rather O
than O
ammonium O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Thus, O
TaAMT2;3a O
may O
be O
exploited O
by O
the O
rust O
fungi O
to O
meet O
their O
demand O
for O
nitrogen. O
This O
hypothesis O
was O
further O
supported O
by O
the O
retarded O
fugal O
growth O
and O
increased O
level O
of O
ammonium O
contents O
in O

at O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
Pst O

in O

The O
primary O

Some O

use O
as O

a O

the O

to O
quantify O
how O
many O

it O
strictly O
for O
their O

The O

(Chen O

Moreover, O

that O

inhibit O
CYP125A1/CYP142A1 O
(C128), O

However, O
direct O
inhibition O
of O
CYP125A1 O

CYP142A1 O
could O
not O
be O

Concluding O
remarks O
New O
anti-TB O
drugs O
are O
needed O
to O
fight O
resistance O
and O
combination O
therapies O
provide O
the O
most O
effective O
treatment O
of O
tuberculosis. O
As O
such, O
Mtb O
CYPs O
could O
provide O
one O
of O
the O
drug O
targets, O
as O
they O
conduct O
very O
specific O
roles O
for O
the O
pathogen. O
In O
addition, O
their O
uniqueness O
to O
Mtb O
highlights O
their O
attractiveness O
as O
therapeutic O
targets O
avoiding O
off-target O
toxicity. O
The O
transcriptional O
response O
upon O
external O
insults O
mimicking O
in O
vivo O
situation O
and O
drug O
exposure O
showed O
that O
Mtb O
CYPs O
and O
cognate O
redox O
partners O
might O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
adaptation O
of O
the O
pathogen O
to O
antibiotics. O

We O
observed O
that O
the O
POLR3B O
R103H O
mutation O
greatly O
impedes O
the O
assembly O
or O
stability O
of O
the O
Pol O
III O
complex. O
Indeed, O
eleven O
of O
the O
sixteen O
remaining O
Pol O
III O
subunits O
were O
detected O
in O
pulldowns O
that O
used O
tagged O
WT O
POLR3B O
whereas O
lower O
amounts O
of O
each O
of O
these O
subunits O
relative O
to O
WT O
were O
pulled O
down O
using O
POLR3B O
R103H O
(Fig. O
2 O
a, O
Additional O
File O
2 O
: O
Table O
S1). O
The O
ratio O
of O
six O
of O
these O
subunits O
showed O
a O
statistically O
significant O
reduction O
in O
the O
mutant O
purifications O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
the O
WT O
(Fig. O
2 O
b), O
implying O
a O
lower O
affinity O
of O
the O
mutant O
POLR3B O
subunit O
for O
its O
partners O
in O
vivo O
and O
a O
decreased O
abundance O
of O
the O
mutant O
Pol O
III O
complex. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
in O
homozygous O
mouse O
cells, O
the O
defective O
Pol O
III O
biogenesis O
conferred O
by O
the O
mutant O
POLR3B O
subunit O
may O
underlie O
the O
impaired O
mouse O
embryonic O
development O
phenotype. O
Importantly, O
when O
combined O
with O
our O
previous O
study O
[ O
6 O
], O
our O
data O
suggest O
that O
mutations O
causing O
a O
milder O
effect O
on O
Pol O
III O
function, O
such O
as O
POLR3A O
G672E, O
may O
not O
lead O
to O
a O
phenotype O
in O
mice, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
inter-species O
differences O
in O
myelination O
[ O
6 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
some O
mutations O
that O
affect O
Pol O
III O
complex O
assembly O
or O
nuclear O
import O
and O
that O
are O
generally O
seen O
as O
compound O
heterozygous O
alleles O
in O
humans O
may O
be O
too O
severe O
in O
the O
homozygous O
state, O
thus O
preventing O
embryonic O
development. O
Indeed, O
numerous O
POLR3-HLD O
cases O
with O
compound O
heterozygous O
alleles O
are O
known O
to O
include O
one O
allele O
with O
a O
frameshift O
or O
nonsense O
mutation O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Since O
we O
have O
only O
studied O
two O
mutations O
thus O
far, O
further O
experiments O
on O
other O
POLR3A O
and O
POLR3B O
mutations O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
confirm O
such O
a O
correlation. O

Background O
Herpes O

type O
2 O
(HSV-2) O
is O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
pathogen O
that O
infects O
both O
the O
oral O
and O
genital O
mucosa O
of O
humans O
and O
is O
a O
significant O
cause O
of O
morbidity O
worldwide. O
A O
mouse O
vaginal O
model O
of O
HSV-2 O
infection O
has O
been O
developed O
by O
several O
investigators O
[ O
1 O
– O

Although O
the O
degree O
of O
pathogenicity O
of O
the O
virus O
for O

is O
dependent O
on O
the O
virus O
strain O
used, O
in O
general, O
experimental O
infection O
by O
vaginal O
route O
(i.v) O
results O
in O
neurological O

which O
is O
preceded O
by O
easily O
recognizable O
symptoms O
due O
to O

followed O
by O
rear O

and O
death. O
This O
mouse O
model O
provides O
a O
useful O
tool O
to O
test O
the O
effect O
of O
antivirals O
against O

Many O

We O
have O

strongly O
inhibited O
the O
replication O
of O
HSV-1 O

Similarly, O

markedly O

Importantly, O

with O
the O

These O

show O
that O

as O
well O
as O
cystatins O
in O

accompanied O

This O
may O
serve O
as O
a O

Therefore, O
in O

to O
eliminate O
the O

bias O
in O
interpreting O
the O

we O

Fig. O

during O

Interestingly, O
the O
OOR O
group O
exhibited O
greater O
than O
10 O
times O
the O
amount O
of O
TNF-α O
observed O
in O
any O
other O
group. O
One O
might O
also O
argue O
that O
IFN-γ O
expression O
in O
the O
OOR O
group, O
which O
is O
upregulated O
almost O
500 O
fold O
over O
the O
OVA O
group, O
is O
important O
in O
the O
physiologic O
and O
histologic O
injury O
observed O
in O
the O
OOR O
group. O
However, O
TNF-α O
levels O
were O
still O
detectable O
at O
17.2 O
± O
2.4 O
pg/ml O
long O
after O
(i.e., O
8 O
days) O
IFN-γ O
expression O
was O
no O
longer O
detectable. O
Though O
the O
mechanisms O
are O
unclear, O
the O
data O
presented O
here O
suggest O
that O
the O
extended O
upregulation O
of O
TNF-α O
may O
be O
important O
in O
the O
lung O
injury O
and O
remodeling O
events O
observed O
in O
the O
OOR O
group. O
Interestingly, O
pulmonary O
viral O
titers O
appeared O
to O
be O
dependent O
on O
age O
at O
initial O
RSV O
infection O
and O
allergic O
phenotype O
of O
the O
mice. O
Recall O
that O
the O
RSS O
and O
OOR O
groups O
had O
significantly O
lower O
viral O
titers O
than O
the O
ROO O
and O
SSR O
groups. O
We O
believe O
that O
low O
RSV O
titers O
in O
the O
RSS O
group O
are O
the O
result O
of O
the O
Th2-bias O
that O
is O
known O
to O
occur O
in O
the O
early O
neonatal O
immune O
system O
of O
both O
mice O
and O
humans O
[ O
30 O
– O
32 O
], O
while O
the O
low O
RSV O
titers O
in O
the O
OOR O
group O
are O
the O
result O
of O
Ova-induced O
Th2 O
immune O
responses. O
Furthermore, O
our O
previous O
studies O
demonstrated O
that O
eosinophil O
associated O
ribonuclease O
11 O
(Ear11) O
transcripts O
increase O
in O
response O
to O
Th2 O
inflammatory O
events, O
such O
as O
Ova O
sensitization O
and O
challenge, O
and O
that O
this O
increase O
is O
paralleled O
by O
a O
concomitant O
increase O
in O
RNase O
activity O
in O
the O
BAL O
fluid[ O

]. O
Ear11 O
belongs O
to O
a O
family O
of O
eosinophil O

including O
eosinophil-derived O

and O

Our O
findings O
further O
support O
the O
view O
that O

likely O
had O
resulted O
in O
an O
irreversible O
airway O
inflammation O
in O
COPD, O
which O
persisted O
despite O

[ O

]. O
We O
observed O
significant O
increase O
of O
Moraxella O
in O

in O

in O
agreement O
with O
previous O
observations O
[ O

]. O
The O
reversal O

of O

diversity O
and O
composition O
prior O
and O
post O
exacerbations O
further O
support O
the O
lung O

during O

Increased O
Haemophilus O
and O
Moraxella O
were O
found O
in O

ICS O

non-ICS O
exposed O
patients, O
consistent O
with O

observations O
[ O
6 O
, O

], O
with O
the O
caveat O
being O
the O
small O
sample O
size O
of O
non-ICS O
users. O
At O
stable, O
the O
microbiome O
was O
comparable O
between O
frequent O
and O
infrequent O
exacerbators, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
baseline O
microbiome O
does O
not O
effectively O
predict O
exacerbation O
frequency. O
Identifying O
markers O
that O
predict O
the O
exacerbation O
frequency O
is O
of O
great O
importance O
for O
COPD O
management O
[ O
53 O
]. O
Differences O
in O
baseline O

were O
hypothesized O
to O
explain O
the O
different O

in O
COPD O

[ O
13 O
]. O
However, O
neither O
this O
study O
nor O
earlier O
reports O
support O
this O
hypothesis O
[ O
54 O
, O
11 O
]. O
Instead, O
previous O
longitudinal O
studies O
showed O
that O
there O
is O
an O
association O
between O
temporal O
variability O
of O
the O
airway O
microbiome O
and O
patient O
exacerbation O
frequency O
[ O
11 O
, O
12 O
], O
suggesting O
that O
the O
frequent O
exacerbator O
phenotype O
might O
be O
more O
relevant O
to O
the O
de-stabilization O
of O
the O
microbiome O
over O
time O
but O
not O
the O
microbiome O
composition O
at O
baseline O
per O
se. O
We O
observed O
no O
significant O
association O
between O
microbiome O
or O
sputum O
cell O
count O
changes O
with O
CAT O
score, O
FEV1 O
or O
FVC, O
which O
suggests O
that O
different O
patient O
inflammatory O
profiles O
(i.e. O
neutrophilic O
or O
eosinophilic O
inflammation) O
and O
their O
associated O
airway O
microbiome O
changes O
are O
likely O
independent O
of O
disease O
severity O
and O
cannot O
be O
distinguished O
clinically O
[ O
55 O
]. O
There O
are O
several O
caveats O
to O
our O
study. O

In O
this O
study, O
helminth O
infections O
occurred O
frequently O
in O
investigated O
animals O
(Table O
4 O
). O
All O
nematode O
species O
found O
in O
this O
survey O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
possess O
pathogenic O
significance O
for O
amphibians O
(Mutschmann O
2010 O
; O
Amin O
et O
al. O
2012 O
; O
Langford O
and O
Janovy O
2009 O
; O
Langford O
2010 O
; O
Yildirimhan O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
Correspondingly, O
amphibians O
are O
well-known O
to O
be O
parasitized O
by O
numerous O
nematode O
families, O
such O
as O
Trichinellidae, O
Rhabditidae, O
Strongyloididae, O
Ascarididae, O
Cosmocercodidae, O
Oxyuridae, O
Heterakidae, O
Camalladae, O
Gnathostomatidae, O
Habronematidae, O
Filaroidae O
and O
Physalopteridae. O
For O
amphibians, O
particularly O
rhabditidean O
helminths O
are O
considered O
as O
pathogenic O
endoparasites O
(Mutschmann O
2010 O
; O
Amin O
et O
al. O
2012 O
; O
Yildirimhan O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
The O
genus O
Strongyloides O
is O
known O
to O
cause O
protein-loss O
enteropathy O
in O
various O
anuran O
hosts O
(Patterson-Kane O
et O
al. O
2001 O
). O
Cosmopolitan O
adult O
female O
Rhabdias O
lungworms O
are O
capable O
of O
parthenogenesis O
and O
known O
to O
parasitize O
lung O
tissues O
of O
different O
amphibian O
hosts, O
including O
various O
toad O
and O
frog O
species O
(Langford O
2010 O
; O
Fernández O
Loras O
et O
al. O
2011 O
), O
while O
males O
live O
in O
earth/ground O
substrates O
(geohelminths). O
Amphibian O
hosts O
become O
infected O
by O
oral O
uptake O
or O
percutaneous O
infection O
of O
exogenous O
infective O
third-stage O
larvae O
(L3) O
which O
then O
migrate O
via O
blood/lymph O
system O
into O
the O
lungs O
(Langford O
and O
Janovy O
2009 O
; O
Langford O
2010 O
). O
In O
lungs, O
adult O
Rhabdias O
females O
start O
producing O
eggs O
through O
parthenogenesis. O
Thus, O
amphibian O
rhabdiosis O
might O
result O
in O
pulmonary O
tissue O
damage O
and/or O
eosinophilic O
pneumonia O
(Densmore O
and O
Green O
2007 O
). O

The O
process O
of O
adhesion O
is O
initially O
based O
on O
non-specific O
physical O
interactions O
between O
two O
surfaces O
(such O
as O
van O
der O
Waals O
forces, O
repulsive O
electrostatic O
double-layer O
forces, O
hydrophobic O
interactions, O
short-range O
forces, O
and O
ion O
bridging). O
Generally, O
hydrophobic O
cells O
adhere O
strongly O
to O
hydrophobic O
surfaces, O
and O
thus O
the O
phenomenon O
of O
cell O
surface O
hydrophobicity O
(CSH) O
is O
responsible O
for O
cell O
aggregation, O
and, O
as O
human O
body O
surfaces O
are O
mostly O
of O
a O
hydrophobic O
character, O
it O
promotes O
binding O
of O
hydrophobic O
bacteria O
to O
the O
intestine O
epithelial O
tissue O
(Krasowska O
and O
Sigler O
2014 O
). O
After O
the O
initial O
attachment O
to O
the O
epithelium O
surface, O
a O
more O
specific O
interplay O
between O
bacterial O
adhesion O
proteins O
and O
mucosal O
surfaces O
takes O
place, O
including O
binding O
to O
specific O
receptors O
(Pérez O
et O
al. O
1998 O
; O
Turroni O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
A O
large O
number O
of O
diverse O
factors O
mediating O
adhesion O
to O
different O
components O
of O
the O
mucosa O
have O
been O
identified O
largely O
owing O
to O
genome O
sequencing O
of O
various O
lactobacilli O
paired O
with O
integrated O
genomic O
techniques O
(Kant O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Smokvina O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
However, O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
often O
well-characterized O
adhesive O
determinants O
of O
pathogens O
and O
their O
specific O
host O
receptors, O
functional O
understanding O
of O
the O
adherence O
of O
commensal O
bacteria O
is O
only O
fragmentary. O
These O
bacterial O
adhesive O
factors O
include O
exopolysaccharides O
(EPSs), O
teichoic O
acids O
(TAs), O
surface O
layer O
(S-layer) O
proteins, O
and O
some O

Understanding O

about O
the O

In O

we O

In O

Although O

[ O

It O
was O
found O
that O
the O
contribution O

this O

virulence O
was O
greater O
during O
pre-penetration/penetration O

when O

Conclusions O
In O

particularly O
via O
the O
prescription O
of O
diagnostic O
tests. O
For O
women O
with O
negative O
urine O
cultures, O
the O
development O
of O
new O
effective O
diagnostic O
tools O
could O
reduce O
antibiotic O
prescriptions O
and O
the O
costs O
of O
these O
UTIs. O

Both O
patients O
with O
positive O
HBsAg O
having O
severe O
hemophilia O
were O
from O
Kabul O
and O
also O
have O
blood O
transfusion O
records. O
Thus, O
they O
might O
be O
infected O
by O
transfusion O
of O
contaminated O
blood. O
This O
study O
seems O
to O
be O
in O
agreement O
with O
all O
blood O
donors O
(with O
1.76% O
HBsAg O
seropositivity) O
tested O
by O
Central O
Blood O
Bank O
Kabul O
during O
the O
years O
1989–2005 O
10 O
. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
HBsAg O
in O
Iranian O
hemophilia O
patients O
varies O
from O
0% O
to O
1.6% O
in O
most O
cities O
11 O
, O
13 O
, O
14 O
and O
4.9% O
in O
Zahedan O
15 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
vaccination O
against O
HBV O
infection O
in O
all O
newborns O
and O
high-risk O
groups O
in O
Iran O
and O
mandatory O
anti-HBV O
screening O
of O
blood O
and O
blood O
products O
may O
be O
the O
key O
to O
effective O
control O
of O
the O
infection O
in O
hemophilia O
patients. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
HCV O
in O
blood O
donors O
has O
been O
reported O
0.14% O
in O
Iran O
16 O
, O
17 O
, O
and O
3.01% O
to O
4.99% O
in O
Pakistan O
18 O
. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
HCV O
in O
Iranian O
hemophilia O
patients O
varies O
from O
51% O
to O
80.5% O
among O
different O
cities O
13 O
, O
16 O
, O
19 O
. O
Lower O
prevalence O
of O
HCV O
in O
Shiraz, O
Iran O
(with O
15% O
HCV O
seropositivity) O
can O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
stringent O
policy O
and O
guidelines O
for O
accurate O
HCV O
screening O
and O
blood O
product O
usage O
14 O
. O
Also O
because O
of O
compulsory O
anti-HCV O
screening O
in O
blood O
units O
since O
1996, O
the O
transmission O
of O
HCV O
in O
Iranian O
hemophilia O
patients O
has O
reduced O
remarkably. O
Such O
that O
there O
was O
no O
HCV O
detected O
in O
Iranian O
hemophilia O
patients O
born O
in O
Shiraz O
from O
2001 O
to O
2010 O
20 O
. O
The O
anti-HCV O
prevalence O
in O
Pakistanis O
hemophilia O
also O
varies O
from O
25% O
in O
children O
in O
Peshawar O
21 O
to O
56% O
in O
Lahore O
22 O
. O
So, O
the O
prevalence O
rate O
of O
HCV O
among O
Afghanistan O
hemophilia O
patients O
in O
this O
study O
seems O
to O
be O
much O
lower O
(8.75%). O
The O
low O
prevalence O
rate O
of O
HCV O
in O
this O
study O
in O
comparison O
with O
Iran O
and O
Pakistan O
might O
be O
in O
view O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
average O
age O
of O
the O
participants O
was O
low O
(with O
the O
mean O
age O
of O
13.66). O

The O
high O
degree O
of O
antibiotic O
resistance O
in O
HCA O
strains O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
frequent O
contact O
with O
healthcare O
facilities O
among O
HCA O
patients, O
where O
the O
drug-resistant O
bacteria O
could O
spread. O
In O
addition, O
other O
factors O
such O
as O
overuse O
of O
antibiotics O
might O
also O
responsible O
for O
developing O
antimicrobial O
resistance. O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
increased O
attention O
should O
be O
paid O
to O
the O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections. O
The O
spread O
of O
CRKP O
strains O
has O
become O
a O
new O
public O
health O
crisis O
worldwide. O
Published O
studies O
on O
the O
distribution O
of O
CRKP O
isolates O
among O
nosocomial, O
HCA, O
and O
CA O
infections O
are O
scarce. O
The O
present O
study O
showed O
that O
CRKP O
strains O
were O
rare O
in O
the O
CA O
group, O
but O
more O
prevalent O
in O
both O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
groups. O
Thus, O
it O
should O
be O
of O
caution O
when O
use O
carbapenems O
to O
treat O
patients O
with O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
infections. O
In O
agreement O
with O
other O
studies, O
the O
bla O
KPC O
was O
the O
dominant O
carbapenemase O
gene O
carried O
by O
CRKP O
strains O
[ O
18 O
, O
29 O
]. O
In O
this O
investigation, O
only O
12 O
and O
3 O
CRKP O
strains O
harbored O
bla O
NDM O
and O
bla O
OXA-48-like O
genes O
respectively. O
Indeed, O
the O
bla O
OXA-48-like O
producers O
were O
more O
prevalent O
in O
western O
countries O
such O
as O
France, O
Spain O
and O
Germany, O
but O
were O
rare O
in O
China O
[ O
30 O
– O
32 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
bla O
genes O
screened O
were O
absent O
in O
five O
CRKP O
isolates. O
Among O
these O
strains, O
only O
one O
showed O
carbapemase O
activity O
in O
the O
modified O
carbapenem O
inactivation O
method O
test O
(data O
not O
shown), O
indicating O
other O
resistance O
genes O
not O
investigated O
may O
mediate O
the O
carbapemase O
activity. O
The O
remaining O
four O
CRKP O
may O
have O
other O
resistance O
mechanisms O
contributing O
to O
carbapenem O
resistance. O
The O
production O
of O
ESBLs O
combined O
with O
mutations O
in O
or O
loss O
of O
the O
porin O
Ompk35 O
or O
Ompk36 O
can O
be O
associated O
with O
carbapenem O
resistance O
[ O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
overexpression O
of O
efflux O
pump O
in O
strains O
may O
also O
lead O
to O
carbapenem O
resistance. O

Such O
potential O
mechanisms O
may O
contribute O
to O
microbiota-mediated O
modulation O
of O
anti-tumor O
immunity O
in O
situations O
of O
gut O
inflammation, O
such O
as O
with O
total O
body O
irradiation, O
chemotherapy O
agents O
that O
cause O
mucositis, O
or O
with O
anti-CTLA-4 O
treatment O
where O
11% O
of O
patients O
experience O
colitis O
and O
34% O
develop O
diarrhea O
[ O
112 O
]. O
However, O
anti-PD-1 O
therapy O
shows O
only O
2% O
incidence O
of O
colitis O
[ O
112 O
], O
suggesting O
that O
additional O
mechanisms O
likely O
exist, O
by O
which O
commensals O
shape O
host O
immunity. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
in O
the O
context O
of O
an O
intact O
barrier, O
mucosal O
DCs O
constantly O
sample O
bacterial-derived O
antigens O
via O
various O
mechanisms. O
For O
instance, O
a O
subset O
of O
DCs O
in O
the O
LP O
are O
reported O
to O
be O
capable O
of O
extending O
dendrites O
between O
epithelial O
cells O
to O
sample O
the O
lumen O
[ O
113 O
]. O
DCs O
may O
also O
acquire O
proteins O
via O
goblet O
cell O
channels O
[ O
114 O
] O
or O
microfold O
cells O
(M O
cells) O
[ O
115 O
]. O
Bacterial O
antigen-loaded O
DCs O
could O
induce O
immune O
tolerance O
to O
commensal O
bacteria, O
or O
they O
could O
prime O
bacterial O
antigen-reactive O
T O
cells, O
which O
in O
some O
instances O
might O
be O
capable O
of O
cross-reacting O
with O
tumor O
antigens O
[ O
18 O
, O
89 O
, O
95 O
] O
or O
in O
other O
cases O
might O
provide O
bystander O
help O
during O
anti-tumor O
responses. O
In O
this O
respect, O
understanding O
the O
mechanisms O
driving O
tolerogenicity O
vs. O
immunogenicity O
might O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
microbiota O
impact O
on O
antitumor O
immunity. O
Given O
the O
complexity O
of O
the O
commensal-host O
interaction, O
the O
diversity O
of O
the O
microbiome, O
and O
inter-individual O
variability, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
multiple O
modalities O
contribute O
to O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
microbiota O
on O
immunotherapy O
efficacy. O
Furthermore, O
the O
relative O
contribution O
of O
the O
microbiome O
will O
need O
to O
be O
integrated O
along O
with O
other O
dimensions O
affecting O
the O
potency O
of O
immunotherapy, O
including O
germline O
genetic O
determinants O
and O
tumor O
cell-intrinsic O
oncogenic O
alterations O
[ O

Diabetes O
is O
a O
health O
condition O
recognized O
as O
a O
major O
concern O
by O
our O
interlocutors. O
It O
was O

that O

can O
be O
diagnosed O
when O

ants O
(because O
of O
their O

and O
also O
when O
the O

such O
as O
Phyllanthus O

are O
much O
favored O
for O

or O
low O

function O
the O
use O
of O

The O

Historically, O
certain O
bacterial O
species O
have O
been O
some O
of O
the O
most O
amenable O
organisms O
to O
genetic O
manipulation, O
and O
the O
breadth O
of O
tools O
available O
to O
study O
and O
modify O
bacteria O
continues O
to O
expand. O
This O
technology O
allows O
the O
modification O
of O
a O
bacterium’s O
existing O
function O
or O
the O
introduction O
of O
completely O
novel O
genes O
[ O
123 O
]. O
For O
example, O
a O
Bacteroides O
strain O
modified O
to O
carry O
a O
gene O
cluster O
to O
utilize O
porphyran O
stabilized O
its O
engraftment O
into O
mice O
fed O
a O
porphyran-supplemented O
diet O
[ O
124 O
]. O
This O
strategy O
effectively O
creates O
a O
unique O
metabolic O
niche O
for O
the O
exogenous O
microbe O
and O
presents O
a O
potential O
means O
to O
facilitate O
probiotic O
efficacy. O
Bacteria O
may O
also O
be O
genetically O
modified O
to O
drive O
expression O
of O
a O
metabolite O
of O
interest O
[ O
125 O
]. O
For O
well-characterized O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Escherichia O
coli, O
genetic O
manipulation O
is O
routine, O
but O
for O
many O
human O
commensals, O
incomplete O
genomic O
information O
leaves O
fewer O
tools O
available O
for O
these O
strategies O
currently. O
To O
circumvent O
this O
limitation, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
express O
bacterial O
genes O
of O
interest O
heterologously O
in O
common O
laboratory O
hosts O
such O
as O
E. O
coli O
or O
Bacillus O
subtilis O
[ O
125 O
]. O
An O
alternative O
approach O
to O
adding O
beneficial O
bacteria O
to O
the O
microbiota O
is O
selective O
depletion O
of O
harmful O
species O
from O
the O
community. O
Bacteriophages O
are O
viruses O
that O
can O
infect O
and O
kill O
bacteria O
and O
are O
naturally O
present O
in O
the O
microbiome O
where O
they O
play O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preserving O
community O
equilibrium. O
Some O
phages O
have O
been O
used O
preclinically O
to O
decrease O
pathogenic O
bacteria O
while O
leaving O
the O
commensal O
community O
intact, O
and O
could O
be O
further O
engineered O
to O
target O
certain O
bacterial O
species O
or O
strains O
[ O
123 O
]. O
Finally, O
if O
a O
bacterial O
metabolic O
pathway O
is O
identified O
along O
with O
defined O
metabolic O
products O
that O
mediate O
improved O
anti-tumor O
immunity O
and O
immunotherapy, O
then O
small O
molecule O
entities O
could O
be O
tested O
as O
candidate O
immune-potentiating O
drugs. O
In O
all O
cases, O
appropriately O
controlled O
clinical O
trials O
will O
be O
required O
to O
validate O
any O
potential O
microbiome-based O
therapy O
and O
to O
assess O
benefits O
and O
risks. O
Clinical O
trials O
to O
evaluate O
the O
impact O
of O
fecal O
microbiome O
transplant O
and O
probiotic O
administration O
with O

are O
already O
underway O

As O

the O

Whereas, O
individual O

Importantly, O
there O

The O

The O
main O
indication O

is O
stomach O

Twenty-nine O
species O

to O
be O
useful O
in O
case O
of O
gastritis O
with O
moderate O

Indeed, O
gastritis O
is O
a O
very O
common O
health O
problem O
in O
Laos, O
especially O
among O
men. O
According O
to O
some O
interlocutors, O
this O

be O
due O
to O
the O

and O
homologous O
regions O
between O
both O
species O
that O
may O
influence O
the O
analysis O
of O
transcriptional O
levels. O

First, O
the O
cost O
generalization O
should O
be O
interpreted O
with O
caution: O
women O
suffering O
from O
UTIs O
without O
dysuria, O
frequent O
or O
urgent O
of O
urination O
were O
not O
included, O
which O
could O
decrease O
the O
estimated O
cost O
of O
UTIs; O
patients O
included O
had O
more O
symptoms O
than O
eligible O
patients, O
which O
could O
influence O
the O
achievement O
of O
diagnostic O
test, O
especially O
lower O
back O
pain O
with O
suspected O
pyelonephritis; O
the O
socio O
economic O
status O
was O
not O
available O
for O
eligible O
women, O
preventing O
to O
compare O
eligible O
and O
included O
patients O
on O
this O
point. O
However, O
in O
our O
study, O
there O
were O
more O
workers O
and O
less O
non-economically O
active O
persons O
than O
in O
the O
general O
population. O
This O
is O
concordant O
with O
the O
French O
inequalities O
of O
health O
care O
recourse: O
unemployed O
and O
retired O
persons O
seek O
less O
care O
than O
economically O
active O
persons O
[ O
38 O
]. O
Second, O
the O
costs O
calculated O
in O
this O
study O
were O
for O
women O
who O
visited O
GPs O
and O
not O
for O
the O
general O
population. O
The O
estimation O
of O
the O
costs O
of O
UTIs O
among O
the O
general O
population O
would O
have O
required O
the O
estimations O
of O
the O
costs O
of O
women O
who O
visited O
hospital O
emergencies O
departments O
and O
specialists O
(i.e., O
urologists O
and O
gynecologists). O
Third, O
the O
data O
used O
to O
estimate O
the O
non-medical O
direct O
costs O
(i.e., O
time O
lost O
and O
monetary O
expenses), O
intangible O
costs O
(i.e., O
loss O
of O
well-being O
for O
the O
patient O
and O
her O
close O
family O
and O
friends) O
and O
presenteeism O
costs O
(i.e., O
the O
loss O
of O
productivity O
due O
to O
a O
UTI O
while O
the O
patient O
was O
working) O
were O
not O
available. O
Fourth, O
the O
friction O
cost O
method O
was O
chosen O
to O
determinate O
the O
indirect O
costs. O
The O
cost’s O
results O
should O
be O
interpreted O
with O
caution O
because O
this O
method O
is O
controversial O
in O
cases O
of O
short-term O
disease. O
The O
human O
capital O
approach O
overstates O
the O
production O
lost O
because O
the O
sick O
employee’s O
colleagues O
can O
offset O
the O
absence O
via O
increased O
productivity O
[ O
27 O
]. O
Consequently, O
the O
estimates O
of O
friction O
costs O
should O
represent O
the O
upper O
bound O
of O
the O
estimates O
of O
the O
short-term O
indirect O
costs O
[ O
27 O
]. O
However, O
in O
cases O
involving O
teamwork, O
the O
absence O
of O
an O
employee O
can O
also O
reduce O
the O
production O
of O
several O
employees O
[ O

]. O

Increasingly, O
the O

is O
also O
being O
recognized O
as O
an O

Indeed, O
many O

were O
summarized O
findings O
on O
CVD O

risk O
factors O
in O
the O
aetiology O
of O

and O
showed O
the O
importance O

in O
AD O
(Jagust, O

). O
Consequently, O
there O
is O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
proofs O
suggesting O
that O
gut O

can O
influence O

important O

the O

T2DM, O
which O
has O

(Pasinetti O

Y. O

can O
cause O
bubonic, O

Of O
these, O
pneumonic O

is O
a O

if O

The O
disease O
is O

the O

phase O
is O
relatively O

non-inflammatory, O
while O
the O

The O

is O
less O

for O
the O

Again, O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
rule O
out O
the O
possibility O
that O
these O

were O
secondarily O
acquired O
by O
the O

it O

As O
for O
the O
possible O

of O
CLO/PXGs O
in O
this O
nematode O
(which O
is O
apparently O
unique O
among O

the O
putative O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
were O
only O

genus O
and O
are O
functionally O
linked O
to O
cryptobiosis O
and O
especially O
to O

tolerance O
[ O

]. O
This O
is O
interesting O
because O
algal O
caleosins O
are O
highly O
upregulated O
following O
salt O

and O
this O
may O
have O
played O
a O
role O
in O
the O

of O

to O

with O
the O

[ O

]. O
The O
third O
non-fungal O
opisthokont O
genome O
with O
a O
putative O

gene O
is O
the O
Amoebozoan, O

Further, O
from O

relied O
heavily O
on O

a O

For O

Gallander O

reviewed O
1179 O
articles O
spanning O
six O

and O
found O
68% O
of O
the O
samples O
to O
be O
student O

They O
also O
found O
that, O
if O
anything, O
the O
reliance O
on O
student O
samples O
had O
increased O
between O
1975 O
and O
1995. O
A O
classic O

by O
Sears O
( O

) O
reviewed O
papers O
published O
in O
1980 O
in O
three O

and O
found O
that O
82% O

to O
identify O
genes O
commonly O

found O
40 O
rice O

that O
were O
responsive O
to O
both O

. O
Our O

identified O
more O
of O
the O

than O
this O
previous O

We O
also O
validated O
our O
meta-analysis O
approach O
using O
additional O
publicly O
available O

not O

through O

we O

similar O
to O
those O
found O
in O
the O
meta-analysis O
(Fig. O

). O
Although O
the O

we O
identified O
several O
BPs O

including O
‘catabolic O

‘cell O

‘embryo O

which O
were O
all O

‘photosynthesis’, O
‘protein O

and O
‘response O

which O
were O
all O
down-regulated O

After O
splitting O
the O
successfully O
developing O
colonies O
into O
four O
nucleus O
colonies O
(see O
Procedure O
below), O
in O
the O
first O
year O
these O
colonies O
must O
be O
treated O
against O
V. O
destructor O
once, O
when O
the O
young O
queens O
have O
started O
laying O
eggs O
and O
prior O
to O
brood O
capping, O
by O
spraying O
with O
oxalic O
acid. O
The O
colonies O
that O
survive O
winter O
into O
the O
next O
spring, O
and O
which O
show O
good O
spring O
development O
(growth O
of O
the O
colony O
and O
drone O
production), O
will O
be O
the O
parent O
colonies O
to O
produce O
the O
next O
generation. O
In O
mid-winter, O
when O
sampling O
bees O
for O
mite O
infestation O
occurs, O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
nucleus O
colonies O
can O
be O
chosen O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
control O
group. O
The O
presence O
of O
a O
control/reference O
group O
of O
colonies O
is O
not O
necessary O
for O
the O
selection O
procedure, O
but O
it O
can O
be O
very O
helpful O
in O
order O
to O
compare O
the O
selected O
and O
non-selected O
groups O
in O
the O
future O
to O
reveal O
the O
local O
mechanisms O
enabling O
colony O
survival O
despite O
V. O
destructor O
infestations. O
Remote O
area O
A O
remote O
area O
is O
needed O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
summer O
to O
mate O
queens O
and O
drones O
within O
the O
population. O
If O
a O
control O
group O
of O
colonies O
is O
part O
of O
the O
set-up, O
a O
separate O
remote O
area O
will O
be O
required. O
We O
consider O
an O
area O
with O
no O
or O
hardly O
beekeeping O
in O
a O
radius O
of O
3 O
km O
as O
being O
adequately O
isolated. O
The O
work O
of O
Jaffé O
et O
al. O
( O
2009 O
) O
and O
Moritz O
et O
al. O
( O
2007 O
) O
concluded O
that O
in O
a O
radius O
of O
1200 O
m, O
60–75% O
of O
the O
matings O
were O
with O
drones O
from O
within. O
In O
a O
trial O
of O
Jensen O
et O
al. O
( O
2005 O
) O
the O
mating O
distance O
(flight O
radius O
of O
queens O
+ O
flight O
radius O
of O
drones) O
was O
in O
50% O
less O
than O
2.5 O
km, O
and O
for O
90% O
within O
7.5 O
km. O
The O
higher O
latter O
distance O
can O
probably O
be O
explained O
by O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
flight O
range O
of O
queens, O
presumably O
caused O
by O
a O
lack O
of O
drones O
in O
the O
area O
(as O
reflected O
by O
a O
reduced O
number O
of O
matings O
per O
queen, O
Neumann O
et O
al. O
1999a O
, O
b O
). O

As O
discussed O
below, O
some O
of O
these O
sequences O
were O
relatively O
divergent O
and O
a O
few O
lacked O
some, O
but O
not O
all, O
characteristic O
features O
of O
the O
better-studied O
CLO/PXG O
sequences O
from O

However, O
the O
small O

size O
precludes O
any O
robust O
conclusions O
about O
the O
relative O
abundance O
of O
CLO/PXG-like O
sequences O
in O
these O
fungal O
phyla. O
Indeed O
it O
might O
be O
the O
case O
that, O
as O
more O
non-Dikarya O
species O
are O
sequenced, O
the O
proportion O
of O
genomes O
that O
harbour O
CLO/PXG-like O
sequences O
might O
rise O
to O
the O
approximately O
30% O
level O
found O
in O
the O
Dikarya. O

Due O
to O
the O

genetic O
diversity, O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
was O
formerly O
even O
split O
in O
three O

species O
[ O

This O
genetic O

has O
probably O
arisen O
as O
a O
response O
to O

of O

of O
phylogenetically O

Elucidating O
the O

One O
classification O
of O
the O

has O
identified O
the O
circulation O
of O
four O
ecotypes O
among O
vertebrates O
of O
Europe O
[ O

We O
define O
in O
this O
paper O
an O
ecotype O
as O
a O
cluster O
of O
genetically O
similar O
A. B-PATH
phagocytophilum I-PATH
isolates O
based O
on O
groEL O
sequences O
following O
Jahfari O
et O
al. O
[ O

Ecotype B-PATH
I I-PATH
based O
on O
this O
classification O
is O
linked O
to O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
mammals O
including O
red O
deer O
(Cervus O
elaphus), O
livestock O
and O
humans, O
whereas O
ecotype O
II O
is O
linked O
mainly O
to O
roe O
deer O
(Capreolus O
capreolus). O
Both O
ecotypes O
are O
most O
probably O
vectored O
by O
I. O
ricinus. O
Ecotype O
III O
is O
associated O
with O
small O
mammals O
and O
expected O
to O
be O
vectored O
by O
Ixodes O
trianguliceps O
[ O
16 O
], O
while O
ecotype O
IV O
is O
linked O
to O
birds O
and O
potentially O
vectored O
by O
I. O
frontalis O
[ O
15 O
]. O
In O
support O
of O
this O
scheme, O
the O
ecotype O
II O
found O
in O
roe O
deer O
was O
for O
example O
not O
the O
one O
found O
in O
livestock O
in O
France O
[ O
17 O
]. O
However, O
due O
to O
scarcity O
of O
studies, O
this O
classification O
in O
ecotypes O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
working O
hypothesis O
of O

rather O
than O
as O
a O

Some O
strains O
of O
this O
widespread O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
have O
been O
reported O
recently O
to O
be O
resistant O
to O
nearly O
all O
known O
antibiotics, O
and O
there O
is O
therefore O
an O
urgent O
need O
to O
find O
alternative O
treatments O
for O
these O
infections O
[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
1910s, O
it O
was O
suggested O
that O
bacteriophages O
could O
be O
used O
successfully O
for O
treatment O
of O
human O
infections O
[ O
5 O
]. O
In O
recent O
decades, O
several O
reports O
have O
revealed O
the O
existence O
of O
multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
strains O
with O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
resistance O
to O
β-lactam O
antibiotics, O
including O
cephalosporins O
and O
penicillins O
[ O
6 O
]. O
To O
combat O
MDR O
A. O
baumannii O
isolates, O
phages O
are O
now O
being O
considered O
as O
alternatives O
to O
antibiotics, O
a O
century O
after O
their O
discovery O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
recent O
decades, O
there O
has O
been O
increasing O
evidence O
of O
the O
feasibility O
of O
using O
phage O
therapy O
to O
treat O
drug-resistant O
bacterial O
infections O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Indeed, O
not O
only O
can O
active O
phage O
be O
applied O
directly O
in O
the O
clinic O
[ O
10 O
], O
but O
new O
potential O
phage-derived O
antimicrobial O
agents O
are O
being O
identified O
and O
certified O
[ O
11 O
]. O
Thus, O
bacteriophage O
therapy O
is O
a O
potential O
strategy O
to O
fight O
MDR O
A. O
baumannii. O
However, O
problems O
including O
narrow O
host O
range, O
unclear O
host-phage O
interactions, O
and O
safety O
issues O
largely O
limit O
its O
clinical O
application. O
Recently, O
we O
performed O
a O
national O
study O
of O
MDR O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
epidemiology O
in O
which O
a O
number O
of O
bacteriophages O
were O
screened O
and O
preserved. O
A O
novel O
phage O
with O
strong O
lytic O
efficiency O
in O
MDR O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
was O
isolated O
from O
wastewater O
from O
the O
intensive O
care O
unit O
of O
a O
burn O
treatment O
centre O
in O
southwestern O
China. O
Sequence O

showed O
that O
this O
phage O
was O
completely O
different O
from O
our O
previous O
reported O
A. O
baumannii O
φAbp1 O
[ O
12 O

and O
it O
was O
therefore O
named O
φAbp2. O
In O
this O
article, O
we O
describe O
the O
characterization O
and O
genome O

of O
the O
phage O
φAbp2, O
which O
will O
provide O
important O
information O
for O
its O
further O
study O
and O

The O

the O

as O

as O

were O

In O

the O

greatly O
affected O
the O

For O

In O

very O
little O
knowledge O
on O

kept O

While O
comparing O
our O

with O
previous O

studies, O
it O
should O
be O
considered O
that O
most O
of O
these O

were O
conducted O
in O
wild O
animals, O
and O
this O
fact O
might O
explain O
prevalence O

Most O
likely O
to O
dicroglossid O
frogs, O
other O
free-ranging O

are O
also O
showing O
higher O

prevalences O
when O

with O
those O
kept O
in O

(Coggins O

Moreover, O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
of O

might O
have O

(Rizvi O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
extrinsic O
risk O
factors, O
such O
as O
habitat O
changes, O
habitat O
losses, O
predatory O
pressure, O
and O

can O
directly O
affect O

very O
little O

whether O

the O

During O

23 O
. O
The O

phenomenon O
has O
been O
described O
in O
several O

24 O
. O
The O
association O
between O

has O
been O

in O
different O

geographic O
areas O
(Senegal O
in O

It O
clearly O
appears O
that O
the O
level O

in O

is O
strongly O
correlated O
with O

during O
the O

following O
the O

28 O
. O
The O
sHLA-G O
level O
of O
a O

was O
also O
associated O
with O
the O
sHLA-G O
level O
of O
his O
mother O
not O
only O
at O
delivery O
28 O
but O
also O
during O
the O

29 O
. O
Moreover, O
mothers O
with O

have O
a O
higher O
probability O

to O
a O
child O
with O
a O
high O

independently O
of O

Altogether, O
these O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
both O
the O
fact O
that O
the O

Introduction O
Peritoneal O
dialysis O
(PD) O
is O
a O
renal O
replacement O
therapy O
used O
by O
approximately O
200,000 O
patients O
with O
end-stage O
kidney O
disease O
worldwide, O
accounting O
for O
11% O
of O
the O
PD O
population. O
Long-term O
PD O
leads O
to O
fibrotic O
changes O
of O
the O
peritoneum O
with O
functional O
decline O
1 O
, O
2 O
. O
In O
addition, O
peritoneal O
fibrosis O
can, O
albeit O
rarely, O
progresses O
to O
fibrous O
encapsulation O
of O
the O
small O
bowels O
as O
a O
“cocoon”, O
known O
as O
encapsulating O
peritoneal O
sclerosis O
(EPS), O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
high O
morbidity O
and O
mortality. O
The O
pathological O
feature O
of O
EPS O
is O
fibrin O
deposition O
due O
to O
plasma O
exudation O
from O
peritoneal O
microvessels O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
Recent O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
inflammation O
induced O
by O
bio-incompatible O
PD O
fluids O
(PDFs) O
and/or O
infections O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
PD-related O
peritoneal O
fibrosis O
4 O
, O
5 O
. O
In O
particular, O
heat O
sterilization O
of O
conventional O
PDFs O
leads O
to O
the O
generation O
of O
glucose O
degradation O
products O
(GDPs), O
such O
as O
acetaldehyde, O
formaldehyde, O
glyoxal, O
and O
methylglyoxal O
(MGO) O
6 O
. O
Of O
these, O
MGO O
is O
an O
extremely O
toxic O
GDP O
that O
causes O
oxidative O
stress O
and O
peritoneal O
injury. O
MGO O
has O
also O
been O
shown O
to O
enhance O
the O
production O
of O
vascular O
endothelial O
growth O
factor O
(VEGF), O
which O
may O
lead O
to O
vascular O
permeability O
and O
procoagulant O
activity. O
Furthermore, O
MGO O
administration O
induces O
peritoneal O
fibrosis O
in O
experimental O
rodents, O
which O
is O
frequently O
used O
as O
an O
animal O
model O
of O
PD-related O
peritoneal O
fibrosis O
7 O
, O
8 O
. O
However, O
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
inflammation O
in O
the O
development O
of O
PD-related O
peritoneal O
fibrosis O
have O
not O
been O
fully O
understood. O

the O

General O

of O
the O

The O
Xenorhabdus O
and O

belong O
to O
the O
family O
Enterobacteriaceae O
within O
Gammaproteobacteria O
(Imhoff O
2005 O
; O
Koppenhöfer O

). O
They O
are O
not O
the O
only O
γ-Proteobacteria O
that O
establish O
mutualistic O
symbiosis O
with O
nematodes. O
Research O
data O
indicate O
that O
Moraxella O
osloensis O
(family O
Pseudomonadaceae) O
can O
enter O
symbiosis O
with O
a O
slug-parasitizing O
nematode O
Phasmarhabditis O
hermaphrodita, O
whereas O
entomopathogenic O
Serratia O

(family O
Enterobacteriaceae) O
have O
been O
found O
to O
associate O
with O
Oscheius O
and O
Caenorhabditis O
nematodes O
enabling O
their O
success O
as O
insect O
pathogens. O
Although O
these O
symbiotic O
associations O
seem O
not O
to O
be O
obligate, O
they O
suggest O
that O
the O
ability O
to O
engage O
in O
symbiosis O
with O
nematodes O
may O
have O
arisen O
several O
times O
during O
the O
evolution O
of O
γ-Proteobacteria O
(Husnik O
et O

2011 O
; O
Dillman O

Studies O
have O
established O
that O
the O
Photorhabdus O

bacteria O
are O
phylogenetically O
close, O
in O
contrast O
to O
their O
EPN O

the O

The O
power O
of O
genomotaxonomy O
has O
recently O
been O
demonstrated O
by O
Machado O
et O
al. O
( O
2018 O
), O
who O
presented O
a O
high-resolution O
taxonomy O
of O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus. O
In O
their O
study, O
consideration O
of O
two O
whole O
genome-based O
phylogenetic O
methods, O
i.e. O
orthologous O
average O
nucleotide O
identity O
(OrthoAni) O
and O
in O

DNA-DNA O
hybridization O
(isDDH), O
supported O
by O
traditional O
methods, O
such O
as O
MLSA, O
MALDI-TOF, O
and O
phenotypic O
tests, O
deeply O
revisited O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
phylogeny. O
Changes O
in O
the O
taxonomy O
of O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
- O
historical O
overview O
Symbiotic O
bacteria O
isolated O
from O
the O
nematode O
Steinernema O
carpocapse O
were O
described O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
1965 O
(Poinar O
and O
Thomas O
1965 O
; O
Poinar O
and O
Thomas O
1966 O
). O
They O
were O
named O
Achromobacter O
nematophilus, O
later O
transferred O
to O
a O
newly O
created O
genus O
Xenorhbdus O
and O
renamed O
as O
Xenorhabdus O
nematophilus, O
and O
finally O
renamed O
as O
Xenorhabdus O
nematophila O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
bacteriological O
nomenclature O
(Thomas O
and O
Poinar O
1979 O
; O
Euzéby O
and O
Boemare O
2000 O
). O
Meanwhile, O
symbiotic O
glowing O
bacteria O
isolated O
from O
Heterorhabditis O
bacteriophora O
were O
included O
into O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus O
as O
Xenorhabdus O
luminescensens O
(Thomas O
and O
Poinar O
1979 O
). O
Therefore, O
up O
to O
1993, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
bacterial O
species O
in O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus, O
i.e. O
Xenorhabdus O
nematophila O
(type O
species) O
and O
Xenorhabdus O
luminesces, O
which O
comprised O
symbionts O
of O
Steinernema O
and O
Heterorhabditis O
nematodes, O
respectively O
(Akhurst O
1983 O
; O
Akhurst O
and O
Boemare O
1988 O
; O
Boemare O
and O
Akhurst O
1988 O
; O
Farmer O
et O
al. O
1989 O
). O

Furthermore, O
the O
neuropathological O
hallmarks O
of O
AD O
consist O
of O
two O
kinds O
of O
protein O
aggregates, O
amyloid O
beta O
(Aβ) O
plaques O
and O
hyper-phosphorylated O
tangles O
of O
tau-protein. O
Aβ O
is O
a O
transmembrane O
protein O
which O
has O
no O
known O
function, O
which O
is O
constitutively O
cleaved O
into O
peptides O
during O
the O
metabolic O
functions O
of O
the O
cell O
(Haass O
et O
al., O
1992 O
). O
However, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
overproduction O
(or O
impaired O
clearance), O
Aβ O
aggregates O
into O
extracellular O
oligomers, O
fibrils O
and O
eventually, O
plaques O
(Masters O
et O
al., O
1985 O
). O
Whereas, O
tau O
is O
an O
intracellular O
microtubule O
binding O
protein O
which, O
when O
hyper-phosphorylated, O
results O
in O
the O
disassembly O
of O
microtubules O
and O
thus O
leads O
to O
the O
impediment O
axonal O
transport O
and O
compromises O
neuronal O
and O
synaptic O
functions O
(Iqbal O
et O
al., O
2005 O
). O
There O
are O
now O
several O
studies O
linking O
obesity O
and O
other O
metabolic O
disorders O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
AD. O
In O
addition, O
the O
inflammation O
and O
the O
pathogens O
interaction O
hypothesis O
(i.e. O
microbial O
infections O
are O
causing O
the O
tau O
tangles O
and O
build-up O
of O
amyloid O
proteins, O
resulting O
in O
the O
ensuing O
cell O
death) O
were O
also O
risk O
factors O
of O
AD O
development. O
The O
‘gut O
microbiota’ O
can O
be O
defined O
as O
all O
the O
species O
within O
the O
ecosystem O
and O
are O
considered O
the O
largest O
reservoir O
of O
microbes O
in O
the O
human O
body, O
containing O
about O
10 O
14 O
microbes. O
Over O
99% O
of O
microbiota O
in O
the O
GI O
tract O
are O
anaerobic O
bacteria, O
with O
archaebacterial, O
protozoa, O
fungi, O
and O
other O
microorganisms O
making O
up O
the O
remainder O
(Hill O
et O
al., O
2014 O
). O
These O
GI O
microbiota O
play O
many O
important O
roles O
in O
physiological O
homeostasis O
and O
metabolism, O
conferring O
many O
health O
benefits O
on O
the O
host O
organism, O
including O
pathogen O
displacement, O
immune O
system O
development, O
barrier O
fortification, O
vitamin O
production O
and O
nutrient O
absorption, O
and O
is O
often O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
‛forgotten O
organ’ O
as O
a O
result O
of O
what O
it O
is O
(O’Hara O
and O
Shanahan, O

In O

according O
to O

The O

(Mucoromycota, O
Zoopagomycota, O

Even O
though O
the O
Ascomycota O
and O

are O
the O
source O
of O
the O
major O

sufficient O
genomic O

to O

individually, O
both O

Using O

In O
an O

the O

a O
total O

However, O
both O

These O
field O
and O
greenhouse O

are O
time O

Unlike O
visual O

In O
overall, O
these O
data O
suggest O
a O
general O
trend O
characterized O
by O
low O
overlapping O
of O
uses, O
with O
the O
notable O
exception O
for O
plants O
used O
for O

issue. O
Still, O
these O
results O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
preliminary. O
Firstly, O
because O
a O
medicinal O
species O
may O
have O
different O
uses O
not O
necessarily O
recorded O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O

Secondly, O
as O
half O
of O
our O

were O

and O

one O
can O
make O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
more O
plants O
used O

would O
be O
known O
by O
them, O
as O
highlighted O
by O

Although O
the O
Lao O

is O
the O
usual O
language O
used O
in O
Laos O
for O
inter-ethnic O
communication, O
our O
Hmong O
interlocutors, O
when O
asked, O
could O
very O
seldom O
provide O
a O
Lao O
name O
for O
the O
plants O
they O
were O
showing O
us, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
plant O
knowledge O
is O
mostly O
inherited O
from O
their O
own O
culture. O
Nevertheless, O
a O
few O
exogenous O
inputs O
resulting O
from O

with O
other O
ethnic O
groups O
can O
be O
highlighted, O
through O
the O

In O
this O

only O

Discussion O
Streptococcus B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
is O
an O
opportunistic O
agent, O
causing O
invasive O
infections O
mostly O
in O
immunocompromised O
patients O
[ O
44 O
]. O
This O
is O
particularly O
evident O
in O
newborns, O
in O
which O
a O
still O
precarious O
immune O
system O
favors O
the O
onset O
of O
severe O
GBS-related O
infections O
such O
as O
neonatal O
sepsis O
and O
meningitis O
[ O
45 O
, O
46 O
]. O

Background O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
is O
a O
major O
human O
pathogen O
that O
can O
cause O
a O
number O
of O
types O
of O
infections O
and O
inflammations, O
ranging O
from O
superficial O
skin O
infections O
to O
life-threatening O
toxic O
shock O
syndrome, O
septicemia, O
osteomyelitis, O
and O
endocarditis O
[ O
1 O
]. O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
has O
developed O
many O
defense O
mechanisms O
to O
protect O
itself O
from O
the O
human O
immune O
system O
and O
antibiotic O
treatment. O
Methicillin-resistant O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
(MRSA) O
has O
been O
spread O
worldwide, O
rendering O
the O
entire O
β-lactam O
class O
of O
antibiotics O
ineffective O
[ O
2 O
]. O
So O
far, O
vancomycin O
has O
been O
the O
most O
reliable O
therapeutic O
agent O
against O
infections O
caused O
by O
MRSA. O
Vancomycin O
binds O
to O
D-alanyl-D-alanine O
residues O
of O
the O
murein O
monomer O
to O
interfere O
the O
synthesis O
of O
bacterial O
cell O
wall O
[ O
3 O
]. O
The O
cell O
wall O
is O
very O
important O
for O
S. O
aureus O
to O
maintain O
an O
osmotic O
gradient, O
and O
a O
thickened O
cell O
wall O
is O
often O
related O
to O
increased O
resistance O
to O
vancomycin O
[ O
3 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
cell O
wall, O
S. O
aureus O
is O
encapsulated O
by O
capsular O
polysaccharides, O
which O
can O
protect O
cells O
from O
phagocytosis O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Two-component O
systems O
(TCSs) O
act O
as O
a O
basic O
stimulus–response O
to O
allow O
organisms O
to O
sense O
and O
respond O
to O
changes O
in O
many O
different O
environmental O
conditions. O
Typical O
TCSs O
have O
two O
components, O
a O
histidine O
protein O
kinase O
and O
a O
response O
regulator. O
The O
kinase O
senses O
the O
environmental O
stimuli, O
autophosphorylates O
at O
a O
histidine O
residue, O
and O
transfers O
the O
phosphoryl O
to O
an O
aspartate O
residue O
in O
the O
response O
regulator. O
Then O
the O
regulator O
is O
active O
to O
regulate O
downstream O
genes O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Bioinformatics O
analysis O
indicates O
that O
S. O
aureus O
harbors O
16 O
conservative O
TCSs. O
In O
many O
cases, O
virulence O
gene O
expression O
is O
controlled O
by O
TCSs O
such O
as O
the O
well-studied O
AgrAC O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
] O
and O
SaeSR O
[ O

]. O

Čeru O
and O
co-workers O
[ O
56 O
] O
showed O
that O
cystatin O
B O
modulates O
cathepsin O
L O
activity O
in O
the O
nucleus, O
therefore O
this O
endogenous O
inhibitor O
could O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
regulating O
the O
proteolytic O
activity O
of O
cathepsin O
L O
to O
protect O
substrates, O
such O
as O
transcription O
factors, O
from O
proteolytic O
degradation. O
Cystatin O
C O
regulates O
cathepsin O
S O
activity O
and O
Ii O
processing O
in O
DCs O
[ O
57 O
]. O
During O
the O
process, O
any O
reduction O
in O
cystatin O
C-cathepsin O
S O
ratio O
may O
result O
in O
a O
substantial O
enhancement O
in O
active O
cathepsin O
S. O
Studies O
on O
cystatin O
C O
derived O
from O
human O
seminal O
plasma O
using O
the O
dot-blot O
technique O
revealed O
that O
cystatin O
C O
interacted O
with O
different O
HIV-1 O
proteins, O
such O
as O
gp160, O
gp120, O
p31, O
p24 O
including O
HIV O
protease. O
Importantly, O
HIV O
protease O
function O
relies O
on O
generating O
mature O
functional O
protein O
components O
of O
an O
infectious O
HIV O
virion. O
Authors O
have O
suggested O
that O
if O
cystatin O
C O
was O
able O
to O
inhibit O
HIV O
protease O
activity, O
it O
might O
prevent O
the O
normal O
function O
of O
the O
HIV O
protease O
and O
therefore O
would O
potentially O
prevent O
viral O
replication O
and O
transmission O
[ O
58 O
]. O
Our O
immunofluorescence O
analysis O
revealed O
evident O
co-localization O
of O
cathepsin O
L O
and O
partial O
co-localization O
of O
cystatin O
B O
with O
viral O
factories O
since O
early O
stages O
of O
ECTV O
infection O
in O
JAWS O
II O
and O
GM-BM O
cells. O
Although O
the O
distribution O
of O
cathepsin O
B O
was O
significantly O
reduced O
at O
each O
time O
point O
of O
infection, O
we O
did O
not O
observe O
co-localization O
between O
this O
protease O
and O
viral O
factories O
in O
tested O
cells. O
Fiegl O
and O
co-workers O
[ O
59 O
] O
have O
observed O
significant O
co-localization O
between O
Chlamydia O
psittaci O
and O
cathepsin O
D O
in O
JAWS O
II O
dendritic O
cell O
line O
at O
72 O
hpi. O
Moreover, O
authors O
have O
indicated O
that O
inhibition O
of O
cathepsin O
D O
or O
S O
decreased O
stimulation O
of O
Chlamydia-specific O
CD8 O
+ O
T O
cells, O
suggesting O
a O
crucial O
role O
of O
these O
proteases O
in O
efficient O
processing O
of O
chlamydial O
antigens. O

The O
catalytic O
activity O
of O
CYPs O
is O
dependent O
on O
their O

partners O
(McLean O

). O
CYPs O
are O
classified O
based O
on O
the O
type O
of O
redox O
systems O
they O
pair O
with. O
All O
Mtb O
CYPs O
belong O
to O
class O
I, O
meaning O
their O
catalytic O
activity O
is O
dependent O
on O
a O
NAD(P)H-ferredoxin-reductase O
(FNR) O
and O
a O
ferredoxin O
(Fd). O
Mtb O
encodes O
five O

(Rv0763c), O
FdxA O
(Rv2007c), O
FdxC O
(Rv1177), O
FdxD O
(Rv3503c), O

Rv1786; O
two O
FNRs O
namely O
FdrA O
(Rv0688) O
and O
FprA O
(Rv3106); O
and O
two O
Fd-FNR O
fusions, O
FdxB O
(Rv3554) O
and O

(Rv0886). O
Fdx, O

where O

and O

n O
indicates O
a O

This O

is O
consistent O
with O
a O
[3Fe-4S] O

which O
is O
conserved O
on O

On O
the O

allows O
fast O

(Baranska O

). O
In O
the O
analyzed O
A. O
thaliana O
wild-type O
plants, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
mutants, O
three O
bands O
have O
been O
identified O
for O
carotenoids O
(Fig. O
2 O
). O
The O
most O
intensive O
bands O
at O
1526 O
and O
1158 O
cm O
−1 O
could O
be O
assigned O
to O
C=C O
and O
C–C O
stretching O
vibration O
of O
the O
polyene O
chain, O
whereas O
the O
band O
at O
1002 O
cm O

was O
related O
to O
rocking O
modes O
of O
methyl O
groups O
attached O
to O
the O
C–C O

of O
the O
main O
chain O
(Schulz O
et O
al. O
2005 O
; O
Withnall O
et O
al. O
2003 O
). O
The O
main O
carotenoid O
pigments O
presented O
in O
the O
leaves O
are O
9-conjugated O
C=C O
carotenoid O
compounds, O
such O
as O
β-carotene O
(also O
α-carotene, O
usually O
in O
a O
much O
lower O
concentration), O
lutein, O
zeaxanthin O
or O
antheraxanthin, O
similar O
to O
the O
results O
obtained O
by O
Schulz O
et O

( O
2005 O
). O
In O
addition O
to O
carotenoid O
signals, O
other O
bands O
mainly O
in O
the O
800–1500 O
cm O
−1 O
regions O
were O
detected O
(Fig. O
2 O
). O
These O
bands O
could O
be O
attributed O
mostly O
to O
monosaccharides, O
disaccharides O
and O
polysaccharides O
and O
for O
this O
reason O
the O
region O
is O
called O
the O
fingerprint O
of O
carbohydrates. O
Bands O
at O
854 O
cm O
−1 O
could O
be O
assigned O
to O
C–O–C O
skeletal O
modes O
of O
sugars O
(mainly O
glucose O
and O
sucrose). O
Bands O
at O
866 O
cm O
−1 O
were O
related O
to O
the O
vibration O
of O
C–H, O
while O
the O
peaks O
at O
915 O
cm O
−1 O
were O
associated O
with O
both O
C–H O
and O
COH O
vibrations. O
The O
peaks O
around O
1260–1280 O
cm O
−1 O
represented O
the O
C–OH O
vibration O
modes, O
whereas O
the O
peaks O
at O
1443 O
cm O
−1 O
could O
be O
interpreted O
as O
the O
C–OH O
stretching O
vibrations. O

Moreover, O

is O
a O

The O

on O
the O

This O
in O

led O
us O
to O
query O
whether O
the O
administration O
of O

[ O

To O
answer O
that O
question O
we O
conducted O
experiments O
following O
an O
indirect O
approach O
based O
on O
the O

To O
that O

produce O
a O
positive-feedback O
upregulation O

via O

degradation O
of O

Because O
of O
specific O
binding O
between O

N-terminus O
of O
IκBɛ O
( O
Fig. O

), O
but O
not O
for O
other O
negative O
regulators O
such O
as O
IκBα, O
IκBɛ O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
only O
factor O
involved O
in O
the O
NFκB/REGγ O
regulatory O
loop. O
Identification O
of O
this O
non-canonical O
degradation O
pathway O
for O
IκBɛ O
may O
explain O
why O
the O
degradation O
dynamics O
are O
different O
between O
IκBɛ O
and O
IκBα. O
Given O
that O
IκBɛ O
shows O
slower O
regulatory O
dynamics O
than O
IκBα, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
regulation O
of O
IκBɛ O
may O
be O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
control O
of O
homoeostatic O
or O
chronic O
inflammation. O
Since O
both O
IκBɛ O
and O
REGγ O
are O
NFκB-response O
genes, O
the O
resulting O
feedback O
circuit O
may O
function O
to O
provide O
constitutive O
control O
but O
is O
subject O
to O
pathological O
derailment O
in O
inflammatory O
colitis. O
Consistent O
with O
this O
notion, O
we O
found O
increased O
expression O
of O
REGγ O
in O
colon O

in O
experimental O

as O

partially O
interpreting O
the O
tissue-specific O
and O
cell-specific O
effects O
of O
the O
REGγ-proteasome O
action. O
Abundant O
publications O
suggest O
that O
increased O
inflammation O
is O
closely O
associated O
with O
elevated O
NFκB O
signalling O
and O
tumourigenesis. O
We O
have O
recapitulated O
this O
scenario O
by O
demonstrating O
that O
REGγ O
depletion O
attenuates O
both O
intestinal O

and O
colon O

Our O
findings O
highlight O
a O
crosstalk O
between O
the O

As O
for O
the O

the O

had O
smaller O
endothelial O
cell O
densities O
compared O
to O
PLGA/aCaP O
without O

(Fig. O

). O
This O
stands O
in O
accordance O
with O
previous O
findings O
in O
our O
group O
26 O
and O
can O
be O
explained O
by O
steric O
hindrance: O
The O
cellular O
density O
in O
grafts O
with O
cells O
was O
so O
high O
that O
neo-vascularization O
was O
more O
challenging O
compared O
to O
scaffolds O
without O
cells, O
exhibiting O
open O
pores O
that O
were O
easily O
to O
access O
and O
infiltrate. O
Still, O
compared O
to O
the O
gold O
standard O
Gore-Tex, O
our O
novel O
ASC-seeded O
hybrid O
scaffold O
allowed O
significantly O
more O
vessel O
ingrowth O
because O
Gore-Tex O
does O
not O
allow O
any O
vessel O
to O
grow O
into O
the O
inert O
material. O
A O
hybrid O
scaffold O
made O
of O
electrospun O
PLGA/aCaP O
and O
a O
layer O
of O
pristine O
PLGA O
is O
a O
superior O
biomaterial O
for O
chest O
wall O
reconstruction O
compared O
to O
PLGA/aCaP O
without O
PLGA. O
The O
main O
and O
important O
advantage O
is O
its O
preserved O
mechanical O
stability, O
even O
after O
a O
two-week O
cell O
culture O
in O
vitro, O
allowing O
an O
easy O
application O
of O
ASCs O
or O
other O
cells O
in O
combination O
with O
the O
hybrid O
material. O
In O
vivo, O
this O
novel O
hybrid O
material O
successfully O
closes O
and O
repairs O
critical O
size O
chest O
wall O
defects O
in O
mice. O
The O
seeding O
of O
ASCs O
onto O
the O
hybrid O
scaffolds O
leads O
to O
an O
enhanced O
recruitment O
of O
hematopoietic O
cells, O
supporting O
the O
regeneration O
at O
the O
defect O
site. O
The O
technically O
easy O
isolation O
of O
ASCs O
from O
fat O
allows O
a O
viable O
option O
to O
seed O
such O
scaffolds O
and O
use O
them O
to O
close O
and O
reconstruct O
chest O
wall O
defects, O
e.g. O
after O
tumour O
resection O
in O
clinics O
which O
at O
the O
same O
time O
is O
the O
main O
indication O
for O
thoracic O
wall O
resection. O
Hence, O
patients O
with O
aggressive O
tumours O
would O
be O
the O
group O
of O
patients O
that O
would O
benefit O
from O
such O
a O
treatment. O

These O
results O
indicate O
that O
the O
Polr3b O
R103H O
mutation O
is O
embryonically O
lethal O
at O
or O
before O
mid-gestation, O
similarly O
to O
Polr3a O
−/− O
null O
mice O
[ O
6 O
]. O
This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
homozygous O
Polr3a O
G672E/G672E O
mice, O
which O
are O
viable O
and O
do O
not O
display O
any O
abnormalities O
at O
12 O
months O
of O

[ O

POLR3A O
and O

protein O

Thus, O
the O

At O

it O
remains O
unclear O
how O
EV71 O
can O
spread O
from O

to O
heart O

via O
an O

We O
proposed O
here O
that O
EV71 O
might O
initially O
infect O
leukocytes O
and O
macrophages O
in O
the O
intestine O
of O
orally O
infected O
mice, O
and O
was O
spread O
to O
multiple O
organs, O
including O
muscle, O

and O

by O

or O
lymphoid O

(Fig. O

This O
hypothesis O
is O
based O
on O
the O
following: O
(1) O
Viral O
RNA O
and O
infectious O
virus O
(pfu) O
can O
be O
detected O
in O
the O

The O
trend O
of O
increasing O
viral O
RNA O
in O

time O
course O
of O
infection O
suggests O
that O
EV71 O
could O
be O
proliferating O
somewhere O
in O
the O
intestine O
(e.g., O
Peyer’s O
patch), O
despite O
the O
lack O
of O

Discussion O
Identifying O
the O
genes O

for O
high O
cold O
resistance O
could O
help O
the O
breeding O
of O
new O
cultivar O
to O
extend O
tea O
plantations O
into O
cooler O
zones. O
To O
date, O
the O
expression O
of O
several O
genes O
[ O
26 O
] O
or O
miRNAs O
[ O
28 O
] O
were O
reported O
in O
response O
to O
cold O
stress O
in O
tea O
plant, O
but O
these O
studies O
did O
not O
take O
acclimation O
or O
cultivar O
differences O
into O
account. O
The O
transcriptome O
profile O
under O
natural O
temperature O
changes O
was O
reported O
in O
a O
tea O
variety O
between O
winter O
and O
early O
spring O
[ O
24 O
]. O
Here, O
the O
systematic O
transcriptome O
profiling O
in O
tea O
varieties O
responsible O
for O
high O
or O
low O
cold O
resistance O
capability O
under O
controlled O
cold O
acclimation O
was O
investigated. O
From O
the O
DEG O
comparisons O
between O
SCZ, O
with O
a O
high O
cold O
resistance, O
and O
YH9, O
with O
a O
low O
cold O
resistance, O
we O
conclude O
that O
at O
least O
two O
expression O
features O
associate O
with O
higher O
cold O
tolerance. O
First, O
less O
expression O
fluctuation O
in O
a O
short-term O
CS O
may O
reflect O
higher O
tolerance. O
This O
could O
be O
seen O
from O
less O
DEGs O
(879 O
vs. O
1589) O
in O
SCZ O
than O
in O
YH9 O
after O
short-term O
(6 O
h) O
CS. O
Second, O
more O
DEGs O
could O
be O
induced O
by O
a O
long-term O
cold O
acclimation O
in O
the O
greater O
cold O
tolerant O
variety, O
which O
may O
result O
in O
a O
better O
preparation O
for O
freezing O
stress, O
and O
thus O
a O
higher O
cold O
tolerance. O
This O
is O
demonstrated O
by O
2383 O
and O
381 O
DEGs O
in O
SCZ O
and O
YH9, O
respectively, O
after O
7-day O
long-term O
cold O
acclimation. O
The O
response O
of O
DEGs O
during O
the O
long-term O
cold O
acclimation, O
not O
the O
short-term O
CS, O
appears O
to O
be O
crucial O
for O
acquiring O
higher O
cold O
resistance. O
Future O
studies O
on O
the O
function O
of O
these O
25 O
DEGs O
in O
SCZ O
during O
the O
long-term O
cold O
acclimation O
should O
be O
of O
highest O
priority, O
including O
analysis O
by O
overexpression O
and/or O
knock-out O
mutations. O
However, O
the O
transformation O
of O
tea O
plants O
is O
still O
a O
big O
challenge. O
Cold O
acclimation O
is O
a O
complicated O
biological O
process O
that O
is O
expected O
to O
integrate O
multiple O
signals. O

The O

Production O

For O

up O

later, O
however O
even O
at O
24 O
h O
the O
cells O
still O
remain O
partially O
resistant O
to O
virus O
infection. O
Since O
acidification O
of O
vacuolar O
compartments O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
cellular O
processes O
we O
wondered O
where O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM O
could O
inhibit O
the O
antiviral O
state O
induced O
by O
interferon O
treatment. O
The O
results O
presented O
in O
Figure O
2a O
showed O
that O
a O
concentration O
of O
50 O
μg/ml O
of O
CDM O
alone O
or O
in O
combination O
with O
interferon O
did O
not O
affect O
uninfected O
cell O
viability. O
Moreover, O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM, O
either O
alone O
or O
in O
combination, O
for O
48 O
h O
(Figures O
2b O
and O
2c O
) O
contributes O
to O
protect O
cells O
from O
virus O
CPE. O
So, O
the O
results O
obtained O
were O
not O
perturbed O
by O
compounds O
cytopathicity. O

Histological O
changes O
observed O
in O
the O
ROO O
group O
were O
similar O
to O
mice O
receiving O
Ova O
alone O
(OVA O
group). O
The O
amount O
of O
airway O
remodeling O
observed O
was O
positively O
correlated O
with O
increased O
airway O
hyperresponsiveness O
to O
aerosolized O
MeCh O
and O
with O
macrophage/eosinophil O
ratios O
in O
the O
OVA O
and O
OOR O
groups. O
Our O
data O
(presented O
here O
and O
elsewhere[ O
20 O
]) O
along O
with O
the O
data O
of O
others[ O
26 O
] O
suggest O
that O
eosinophils O
play O
a O
prominent O
role O
in O
orchestrating O
the O
local O
pulmonary O
immune O
responses O
and O
pathologies O
associated O
with O
allergic O
inflammation O
(i.e., O
asthma). O
It O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
if O
the O
specific O
loss O
of O
eosinophils O
leads O
to O
improvement O
of O
pulmonary O
function O
parameters O
and O
pathologies O
associated O
with O
neonatal O
RSV O
infection. O
Analysis O
of O
cytokine O
data O
demonstrated O
elevations O
in O
both O
Th2 O
and O
Th1 O
cytokines. O
Previous O
studies O
have O
clearly O
demonstrated O
that O
TNF-α O
contributes O
to O
early O
clearance O
of O
RSV O
[ O
27 O
]; O
however, O
continued O
production O
of O
TNF-α O
exacerbates O
RSV-induced O
illness O
[ O
28 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
neutralization O
of O
TNF-α O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
clinical O
illness O
without O
an O
impairment O
on O
viral O
clearance[ O
29 O
]. O
Interestingly, O
the O
OOR O
group O
exhibited O
greater O
than O
10 O
times O
the O
amount O
of O
TNF-α O
observed O
in O
any O
other O
group. O
One O
might O
also O
argue O
that O
IFN-γ O
expression O
in O
the O
OOR O
group, O
which O
is O
upregulated O
almost O
500 O
fold O
over O
the O
OVA O
group, O
is O
important O
in O
the O
physiologic O
and O
histologic O
injury O
observed O
in O
the O
OOR O
group. O
However, O
TNF-α O
levels O
were O
still O
detectable O
at O
17.2 O
± O
2.4 O
pg/ml O
long O
after O
(i.e., O
8 O
days) O
IFN-γ O
expression O
was O
no O
longer O
detectable. O
Though O
the O
mechanisms O
are O
unclear, O
the O
data O
presented O
here O
suggest O
that O
the O
extended O
upregulation O
of O
TNF-α O
may O
be O
important O
in O
the O
lung O
injury O
and O
remodeling O
events O
observed O
in O
the O
OOR O
group. O

In O
nature, O
these O

F. O

A O
large O

was O
also O
observed O
among O

Interestingly, O
some O
of O
the O

that O

also O
best O
reciprocal O

between O
the O

and O
the O

identified O
as O

HGT O

an O
important O
mechanism O
providing O

The O
microbiome O
of O
F. O
candida O
contained O
several O
pathways O
responsible O
for O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
secondary O

This O
is O
a O
class O
of O
compounds O
that O
are O
often O
involved O
in O
competition O

interaction O
between O
species, O

they O
may O

through O
the O

. O
Secondary O
metabolites O
often O
find O
applications O
in O
the O
biotechnological O
and O

sector. O
The O
main O

to O
the O

seem O
to O
be O
Gordonia, O
Pseudomonas O

Bacillus O

A O
few O
of O
the O
identified O
pathways O
were O
represented O
by O
NRPSs, O
a O
class O
of O
enzymes O
responsible O
for O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
natural O

with O
a O
broad O
range O

Another O
NRPS O

Using O
RNA-sequencing O
(RNA-seq), O
we O
found O
that O
Polr3a O
and O
Polr3b O
mRNA O
levels O
were O
comparable O
in O
WT O
and O
DM O
mice O
(Fig. O

providing O
further O
evidence O
that O
the O
two O
missense O

do O
not O
alter O
mRNA O
stability. O
Furthermore, O
the O
three O
Pol O

transcripts O
detected O
by O
this O
technique O
(Rpph1, O

and O
Rn7sk) O
appeared O
unaffected O
by O
the O
Polr3a O
and O
Polr3b O
mutations O
(Fig. O

In O
addition, O
no O
protein-coding O

showed O
significant O
differences O

and O

between O

demonstrating O
that O
Polr3a O

R103H O
missense O
mutations O
do O
not O
have O
a O

We O
also O
measured O
the O
levels O
of O
one O

by O

found O
no O
change O
in O
their O

in O

suggesting O
that O
50% O

sufficient O
to O

Thus, O
our O
findings O

that O
adding O

However, O
as O
described O
by O
the O
authors, O
one O
significant O
limitation O
of O
the O
approach O
is O
that O
“decontam O
assumes O
that O
contaminants O
and O
true O
community O
members O
are O
distinct O
from O
one O
another.” O
In O
our O
view, O
such O
binary O
assignments O
are O
not O
realistic O
for O
a O
number O
of O
important O
microbes O
in O
numerous O
experimental O
situations. O
Consider O
the O
example O
of O
a O
human O
patient O
harboring O
an O
Escherichia B-PATH
coli I-PATH
bloodstream O
infection. O
As O
E. O

appears O
to O
be O
a O
ubiquitous O
laboratory O
contaminant, O
attempts O
to O
sequence O
the O
metagenome O
from O
a O
blood O
sample O
would O
produce O
a O
final O
E. O

sequencing O
count O
with O
contributions O
from O
both O
reagent O
contamination O
and O
the O
true O
microbiome. O
Disregarding O
E. O
coli O
as O
a O
component O
of O
the O
microbiome O
based O
on O
its O
identification O
as O
a O

would O
result O

a O

which O

in O

Similar O
vignettes O
can O

that O
are O
both O
pathogenic O
and O
common O
laboratory O
contaminants, O
including O
Staphylococcus B-PATH

We O
propose O
the O
following O
logical O
extension O
of O
Davis O
et O

After O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
inverse O
linear O
relationship O
between O

an O
experiment, O
the O
quantity O

reads O
for O
a O
given O
taxa O
in O
a O
given O
sample O
can O
be O
described O
according O
to O
its O
deviation O
from O
the O
value O
predicted O
by O
the O
above-described O
linear O
regression. O
Dividing O
this O
value O
by O
the O
standard O
error O
produces O
the O
studentized O
residual, O
which O
can O
serve O
to O

to O
the O

also O

at O

The O

the O

of O
the O

Such O
survival O
methods O
highlight O
the O
success O
of O
Cryptococcus O
as O
an O
environmental O
opportunistic O
pathogen, O
which O
can O
exploit O
a O
diverse O
range O
of O
host O
species. O
Intracellular O
growth O
of O
cryptococci O
in O
macrophages O
is O
one O
of O
the O
earliest O
described O
characteristics O
of O
human O
cryptococcal O
cellular O
pathogenesis O
24 O
, O
correlates O
with O
disease O
and O
is O
conserved O
in O
such O
diverse O
organisms O
as O
insect O
phagocytes O
25 O
and O
social O
amoebae O
26 O
. O
What O
then O
determines O
the O
resistance O
of O
avian O
macrophages O
to O
cryptococcal O
proliferation? O
Tolerance O
of O
relatively O
high O
body O
temperatures O
is O
the O
primary O
determinant O
of O
fungal O
infections O
in O
homoeothermic O
hosts O
and O
explains O
why O
so O
few O
fungi O
are O
pathogens O
of O
mammals O
21 O
. O
However, O
Cryptococcus O
neoformans O
is O
a O
remarkably O
thermotolerant O
yeast O
27 O
and O
this O
thermotolerance O
is O
the O
primary O
distinguishing O
feature O
for O
disease-causing O
cryptococcal O
species, O
even O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
other O
major O
virulence O
factors. O
The O
maximal O
growth O
range O
of O
Cryptococcus O
varies O
between O
strains O
and O
by O
growth O
environment O
but O
shows O
significant O
overlap O
with O
avian O
body O
temperature O
28 O
. O
In O
agreement O
with O
this O
we O
show O
that O
Cryptococcus O
is O
able O
to O
grow O
at O
42 O
°C O
in O
an O
extracellular O
niche. O
However, O
cryptococci O
were O
unable O
to O
grow O
intracellularly O
in O
avian O
macrophages O
and O
shifting O
avian O
macrophages O
to O
lower O
temperatures O
alone O
restored O
the O
intracellular O
proliferative O
capacity O
of O
cryptococci, O
thus O
demonstrating O
the O
essential O
contribution O
of O
this O
innate O
cellular O
immune O
response O
to O
suppression O
of O
cryptococcosis O
in O
birds. O
Remarkably, O
we O
also O
demonstrate O
that O
vomocytosis O
of O
intracellular O
cryptococci O
occurs O
in O
avian O
macrophages O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
indistinguishable O
from O
mammalian O
vomocytosis O
in O
either O
morphology O
or O
frequency. O
In O
addition, O
this O
process O
appears O
to O
be O
unaffected O
by O
temperature O
of O
the O
avian O
cell O
and O
when O
proliferation O
is O
severely O
restricted. O

The O
interviews O
took O
place O
after O
a O
particularly O
wet O
season, O
and O
at O
least O
two O
producers O
reported O
partial O
or O
complete O
crop O
failures. O
Rains O
before O
harvest O
resulted O
in O
crops O
that O
were O
too O
wet O
to O
satisfactorily O
harvest. O
Barley—like O
wheat O
in O
the O
USA—has O
low O
operating O
costs, O
high O
capital O
costs, O
and O
tends O
to O
be O
a O
low-margin O
or O
break-even O
crop. O
However, O
when O
overhead O
costs O
were O
factored O
in, O
the O
net O
margin O
was O
slightly O
negative O
given O
the O
relatively O
high O
capital O
investment O
costs. O
Organic O
wheat O
is O
similarly O
a O
low-margin O
crop O
when O
compared O
with O
maize O
and O
soybeans O
(McBride O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
Cost O
and O
return O
data O
are O
summarized O
in O
Table O

However, O
there O
were O
great O
regional O
differences O
in O
cost O
of O
production O
as O
well O
as O
return O
per O
acre. O
Irrigated O
farms O
had O
higher O
costs O
of O
production, O
but O
also O
higher O
returns O
and, O
based O
on O
the O
interviews, O
less O
risk O
of O
crop O
failure O
in O
a O
dry O
year. O

Discussion O
and O
conclusions O
The O
organic O
producers O
surveyed O
and O
interviewed O
view O
barley O
as O
a O
valuable O
crop O
in O
their O
rotation, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
not O
always O
a O
profitable O
one. O
Economic O
rather O
than O
agronomic O
factors O
were O
considered O
the O
biggest O
barriers O
to O
the O
expanded O
production O
of O
barley. O

Researchers O
sometimes O
raise O
concerns O
that O
data O
collected O
via O
online O
sampling O
might O
be O
of O
lower O
quality O
than O
that O
collected O
using O
more O
traditional O
methods O
(e.g. O
Matzat O
and O
Snijders O
2010 O
; O
Paolacci O
and O
Chandler O
2014 O
). O
Online O
participants O
do O
not O
have O
easy O
access O
to O
the O
researcher O
to O
raise O
queries, O
might O
enter O
data O
carelessly O
or O
thoughtlessly, O
or O
might O
have O
chosen O
to O
enter O
data O
merely O
in O
order O
to O
view O
the O
study O
content O
(Aust O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Accordingly, O
to O
test O
the O
quality O
of O
online O
data O
collection, O
various O
studies O
have O
compared O
data O
collected O
online O
and O
offline O
and O
concluded O
that O
in O
many O
instances O
the O
two O
sampling O
methodologies O
give O
rise O
to O
very O
similar O
outcomes O
(Krantz O
and O
Dalal O
2000 O
). O
For O
instance, O
judgements O
of O
the O
attractiveness O
of O
different O
female O
body O
shapes O
were O
similar, O
irrespective O
of O
whether O
data O
were O
collected O
from O
laboratory O
studies O
of O
psychology O
undergraduate O
students O
or O
online O
from O
visitors O
to O
psychology O
webpages O
hosted O
by O
the O
same O
university O
(Krantz O
et O
al. O
1997 O
). O
Nevertheless, O
data O
collected O
online O
and O
offline O
are O
not O
identical O
(Birnbaum O
2004 O
; O
Epstein O
et O
al. O
2001 O
). O
This O
is O
unsurprising, O
given O
that O
context O
and O
environment O
can O
influence O
behaviour. O
The O
demographic O
differences O
between O
people O
with O
and O
without O
internet O
access O
may O
be O
particularly O
stark O
in O
developing O
countries, O
and O
so O
online O
sampling O
may O
not O
be O
the O
most O
suitable O
way O
to O
reach O
diverse O
populations O
in O
those O
countries O
(Batres O
and O
Perrett O
2014 O
), O
and O
in O
some O
instances O
of O
course O
internet O
access O
can O
contribute O
to O
behaviour O
that O
we O
might O
want O
to O
assess; O
for O
example, O
media O
exposure O
appears O
to O
explain O
differences O
in O
preferences O
for O
faces O
and O
body O
types O
(Boothroyd O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
However, O
despite O
the O
differences O
between O
online O
and O
offline O
samples, O
one O
should O
not O
be O
seen O
as O
the O
poor O
cousin O
of O
the O
other; O
both O
have O
strengths O
and O
can O
be O
used O
in O
complementary O
fashion O
to O
rigorously O
test O
inferences. O
Implications O
of O
Relying O
on O
Restricted O
Samples O
From O
a O
statistical O
point O
of O
view, O
restricted O
sampling O
can O
lead O
to O
selection O
bias O
which O
in O
turn O
can O
lead O
to O
confounding O
(Bareinboim O
and O
Pearl O
2012 O
; O
Elwert O
and O
Winship O
2014 O
; O
Fiedler O
2000 O
; O
Rohrer O
2018 O
). O

We O
have O
no O
explicit O
hypotheses, O
but O
rather O
describe O
the O
samples O
used O
in O
these O
two O
journals O
according O
to O
their O
geographical O
origin, O
age O
group O
(adult O
or O
child), O
student O
status O
and O
source O
(online O
vs. O
offline). O
In O
addition, O
we O
test O
whether O
the O
sample O
sizes O
vary O
based O
on O
these O
categories. O
Our O
aim O
is O
to O
provide O
an O
up-to-date O
snapshot O
of O
contemporary O
evolutionary O
psychology O
sampling O
practice, O
while O
responding O
to O
calls O
to O
increase O
description O
within O
science O
(Scott-Phillips O
2018 O
); O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
move O
forward O
if O
we O
better O
know O
where O
we O
currently O
stand. O
Methods O
Coding O
As O
part O
of O
a O
larger O
project, O
data O
relevant O
to O
our O
research O
questions O
were O
captured O
from O
all O
of O
the O
articles O
published O
in O
2015 O
and O
2016 O
within O
the O
journals O
‘Evolutionary O
Psychology’ O
(EP, O
published O
by O
Sage) O
and O
‘Evolution O
&amp; O
Human O
Behavior’ O
(E&amp;HB, O
published O
by O
Elsevier). O
The O
2015 O
articles O
were O
coded O
by O
eight O
coders O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
the O
first O
author, O
and O
the O
2016 O
articles O
were O
coded O
by O
the O
first O
author. O
Of O
course, O
many O
key O
papers O
on O
evolutionary O
psychology O
are O
published O
in O
other O
outlets, O
such O
as O
‘Journal O
of O
Personality O
and O
Social O
Psychology’ O
(e.g. O
Buss O
and O
Shackelford O
1997 O
; O
Kenrick O
et O
al. O
1995 O
) O
or O
‘Psychological O
Science’ O
(e.g. O
Buss O
et O
al. O
1992 O
). O
However, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
assume O
that O
any O
article O
published O
in O
EP O
and O
E&amp;HB O
is O
allied O
to O
the O
discipline O
of O
evolutionary O
psychology, O
broadly O
conceived. O
In O
addition, O
the O
choice O
follows O
Kurzban’s O
( O
2013 O
) O
selection O
of O
E&amp;HB O
for O
analysis O
and O
the O
publication O
of O
his O
analysis O
within O
the O
Evolutionary O
Psychology O
blog, O
on O
the O
website O
of O
the O
eponymous O
journal. O
The O
coders O
recorded O
the O
geographical O
region O
from O
which O
the O
data O
originated O
based O
on O
the O
M49 O
UNDP O
codes O
(United O
Nations O
2013 O
: O
Africa, O
North O
America, O
Latin O
America O
and O
the O
Caribbean, O
Asia, O
Australia, O
Europe O
and O
Oceania O
(excluding O
Australia)). O
If O
a O
paper O
listed O
more O
than O
five O
countries, O
we O
labelled O
it O
‘cross-cultural’; O
we O
coded O
each O
sample O
individually O
for O
papers O
with O
one O
to O
four O
geographical O
samples. O

Interestingly, O
when O
cells O
were O
treated O
with O
CDM O
plus O
IFN O
combination O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
additive O
antiviral O
effect, O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
was O
confirmed O
by O
next O
experiments. O
We O
also O
tested O
if O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM O
under O
different O
experimental O
conditions O
could O
affect O
the O
antiviral O
action O
of O
IFNs O
on O
HSV-2 O
MS O
replication. O
Virus O
yields O
at O
24 O
h O
p.i. O
were O
determined O
in O
Vero O
cells O
treated O
with O
CDM O
as O
follows: O
i) O
for O
2 O
h O
prior O
to O
interferon O
induction O
and O
then O
removed, O
ii) O
added O
simultaneously O
with O
IFN O
and O
remained O
only O
for O
16 O
h O
before O
infection, O
iii) O
added O
after O
virus O
infection O
and O
remained O
to O
virus O
harvest, O
iiii) O
added O
with O
IFN O
16 O
h O
before O
infection, O
re-added O
after O
infection O
and O
remained O
to O
virus O
harvest. O
The O
results O
obtained O
following O
protocol O
i) O
are O
depicted O
in O
Figure O
3a O
. O
The O
antiviral O
effect O
due O
to O
interferon O
alone O
or O
in O
combination O
is O
2-fold O
increased O
in O
cells O
pretreated O
with O
CDM, O
as O
an O
indication O
that O
CDM O
treatment O
did O
not O
interfere O
with O
the O
antiviral O
activity O
displayed O
by O
IFN O
alone O
or O
in O
combination. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
we O
can O
speculate O
that O
the O
antiviral O
effect O
of O
CDM O
alone O
contributed O
in O
an O
additive O
manner O
to O
the O
overall O
antiviral O
activity. O
When O
CDM O
was O
present O
during O
the O
16 O
h O
IFN O
antiviral O
induction O
period, O
the O
interpretation O
of O
the O
results O
are O
rather O
complicated O
because O
of O
the O
antiviral O
effect O
of O
CDM O
per O
se O
which O
reduced O
HSV-2 O
replication O
by O
20-fold O
(Figure O
3b O
). O
Likewise, O
in O
the O
experiments O
described O
in O
Figure O
3a O
, O
there O
is O
an O
additive O
effect O
of O
CDM O
when O
cells O
were O
treated O
with O
both O
IFN-α O
or O
IFN-γ O
or O
their O
combination O
(Figure O
3b O
). O
When O
CDM O
was O
added O
after O
virus O
infection O
and O
remained O
until O
24 O
h O
p.i. O
or O
it O
was O
also O
present O
during O
the O
induction O
period, O
the O
antiviral O
effect O
of O
the O
compound O
was O
so O
high O
(100-fold O
and O
20.000-fold O
reduction O
virus O
yield O
respectively) O
that O
masked O
its O
interaction O
with O
IFNs O
(Figure O
3c O
and O
3d O
). O
For O
that O
reason, O
we O
repeated O
the O
experiment O
shown O
in O
Figure O
3c O
with O
lower O
concentrations O
of O
CDM. O

Accumulating O
evidence O
points O
to O
the O
gut O
microbiome O
being O
involved O
in O
CRC O
[ O
13 O
]. O
For O
example, O
some O
researchers O
have O
reported O
that O
Streptococcus O
bovis O
[ O
14 O
] O
and O
Streptococcus O
gallolyticus O
[ O
15 O
] O
are O
specific O
bacteria O
involved O
in O
colorectal O
cancer; O
Castellarin O
et O
al. O
[ O
16 O
] O
found O
that O
Fusobacterium B-PATH
nucleatum I-PATH
infection O
is O
prevalent O
in O
CRC O
tissue O
specimens O
and O
Kostic O
et O
al. O
[ O
17 O
], O
found O
that O
Fusobacterium B-PATH
nucleatum I-PATH
can O
generate O
a O
proinflammatory O
microenvironment O
that O
is O
conducive O
to O
the O
progression O
of O
CRC O
through O
recruitment O
of O
tumor-infiltrating O
immune O
cells. O
Moreover, O
many O
enzymes, O
peptides O
and O
small O
molecules O
secreted O
by O
the O
intestinal O
gut O
microbiome O
are O
involved O
in O
activating O
and O

important O

molecules O
and O
signaling O
pathways O
involved O
in O
the O
progression O
of O
CRC O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
Diarrhea O
and O
gut O
microbiome O
disorders O
interact O
as O
both O
cause O
and O
effect. O
Diarrhea O
can O
disrupt O
the O
balance O
of O
the O
gut O
microenvironment. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
invasion O
of O
exogenous O
pathogenic O
microorganisms O
and O
the O
imbalance O
of O
intestinal O
microbes O
can O
lead O
to O
diarrhea O
[ O

]. O
For O
example, O
the O
invasion O

The O

The O

holds O
true O
for O
its O
possible O
impact O
on O
animal O
health O
kept O
in O

(Mutschmann O

Nevertheless, O
Blastocystis O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
potentially O
pathogenetic O
protozoan O
species O
and O
infections O
should O
be O
considered O

Moreover, O
during O
dissections O
we O
here O
diagnosed O
Entamoeba O

in O
three O
(2.8%) O
animals. O
Several O

focused O
on O
gastrointestinal O
apicomplexan O
coccidian O
parasites O
in O
amphibians O
(Duszynski O
et O

). O
So O
far, O
monoxenous O
coccidian O
genera O
Eimeria, O
Goussia, O
Hyaloklossia, O
and O
Cystoisospora O
(former O

have O
been O
described O
in O
diverse O

and O
for O
further O
review O
a O
disposed O
online O
version O
( O
http://biology.unm.edu/coccidia/anura.html O
) O
is O
recommended. O
In O
accordance O
with O
these O
reports, O
we O
also O
diagnosed O
un-sporulated O
coccidian O
oocysts O
in O
one O
animal O
(0.6%), O
but O
amphibian O
oocysts O
were O
not O
fully O

to O

Furthermore, O
non-sporulated O
Eimeria O
spp. O
oocysts O
were O
found O
within O
gut O
lumen O
of O
one O
dissected O
fire O
salamander, O
(Salamandra O

but O
coccidian-derived O
death O
was O
ruled O
out O
as O
this O
animal O
was O
also O
co-infected O
with O
Aplectana O
spp., O
Spironucleus O

and O
Tritrichomonas O

and O
showed O
a O

Enteropathogenic O
apicomplexan O
Cryptosporidium O
is O
known O
to O
infect O
also O
the O
microvillus O
border O
of O
amphibian O
gastrointestinal O
epithelial O
cells O
(Jirků O
et O

2008 O
). O
Consistently, O
we O
diagnosed O
Cryptosporidium O
oocysts O
in O
an O
Australian O
frog O
(L. O
caerulea) O
via O
CFS O
analysis. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
genetic O
change O
needed O
by O
one O
of O
the O
most O
deeply O
rooted O
of O
all O
Y. O
pestis O
strains O
to O
cause O
a O
fulminant O
lung O
infection, O
and O
indicates O
that O
even O
during O
the O
transitional O
evolutionary O
state O
between O
Y. O
pseudotuberculosis O
and O
modern O
Y. O
pestis, O
this O
ancestral O
species O
was O
primed O
to O
cause O
pneumonic O
plague. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
addition O
of O
pPCP1 O
to O
Y. O
pseudotuberculosis O
does O
not O
result O
in O
proteolytically O
active O
Pla O
or O
enhance O
virulence O
in O
mice, O
as O
Pla O
produced O
by O
Y. O
pseudotuberculosis O
is O
sterically O
inhibited O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
O-antigen O
on O
the O
bacterial O
surface O
24 O
, O
43 O
, O
44 O
. O
While O
the O
pPCP1 O
plasmid O
itself O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
explain O
all O
of O
the O
differences O
in O
virulence O
between O
Y. O
pseudotuberculosis O
and O
Y. O
pestis, O
our O
data O
does O
indicate O
that O
ancestral O
strains O
could O
initiate O
epidemics O
of O
pneumonic O
plague O
as O
soon O
as O
pPCP1 O
was O
acquired. O
The O
origin O
of O
the O
pPCP1 O
plasmid O
remains O
unknown, O
although O
it O
encodes O
a O
ColE1-like O
origin O
of O
replication, O
suggesting O
a O
common O
ancestry O
with O
plasmids O
typically O
found O
in O
enteric O
organisms O
31 O
. O
The O
plasmid O
encodes O
three O
proteins; O
thus O
far O
Pla O
is O
the O
only O
virulence O
determinant O
encoded O
on O
pPCP1 O
shown O
to O
be O
important O
for O
development O
of O
enhanced O
disease O
by O
modern O
Y. O
pestis O
37 O
, O
45 O
, O
a O
conclusion O
that O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
this O
work. O
In O
addition, O
our O
data O
clearly O
indicate O
that O
not O
only O
the O
acquisition O
but O
also O
the O
modification O
of O
Pla O
was O
a O
crucial O
adaptation O
in O
the O
systemic O
spread O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
from O
both O
the O
lungs O
and O
the O
lymph O
node. O
The O
prominent O
function O
of O
Pla O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
proteolytic O
activation O
of O
host O
Plg O
into O
plasmin, O
which O
allows O
the O
bacteria O
to O
escape O
from O
immobilizing O
fibrin O
clots O
and O
potentiates O
fibrinolysis. O

However, O
the O
exact O
role O
of O
cathepsins O
during O
poxvirus O
infection O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
adequately O
investigated. O
The O
mousepox O
virus O
(ectromelia O
virus, O
ECTV) O
is O
a O
double O
stranded O
DNA O
virus O
that O
belongs O
to O
Poxviridae O
family O
of O
viruses O
in O
the O
genus O
Orthopoxvirus, O
the O
same O
genus O
that O
encompasses O
variola O
virus O
(VARV, O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
smallpox) O
and O
vaccinia O
virus O
(VACV) O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Infection O
of O
mice O
with O
ECTV O
causes O
symptoms O
much O
similar O
to O
those O
observed O
in O
people O
infected O
with O
VARV O
[ O
15 O
, O
16 O
]. O
Moreover, O
infection O
with O
ECTV O
is O
characterized, O
in O
contrast O
to O
VACV, O
by O
a O
narrow O
host O
range O
and O
the O
course O
of O
infection O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
that O
observed O
in O
humans O
infected O
with O
VARV O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Orthopoxviruses O
have O
well-evolved O
immune O
evasion O
strategies O
to O
elude O
and O
manipulate O
the O
host O
defense O
mechanisms O
[ O
18 O
– O
20 O
]. O
The O
activity O
of O
cysteine O
cathepsins O
is O
regulated O
by O
endogenous O
protein O
inhibitors O
called O
cystatins. O
There O
are O
three O
types O
of O
cystatins: O
type O
1 O
cystatins, O
also O
called O
stefins O
(A O
and O
B) O
are O
generally O
located O
intracellularly; O
type O
2 O
cystatins: O
C, O
D, O
E/M, O
F, O
S, O
SN O
and O
SA O
are O
extracellular O
proteins, O
and O
type O
3 O
cystatins O
– O
kininogens O
which O
are O
multifunctional O
plasma O
proteins O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Beyond O
regulation O
of O
cysteine O
cathepsins O
activity O
cystatins O
also O
protect O
host O
cells O
from O
pathogens O
that O
use O
cysteine O
proteases O
for O
cell O
entry O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Our O
previous O
studies O
showed O
that O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
level O
of O
cathepsin O
B, O
L O
and O
S O
was O
downregulated O
during O
infection O
of O
murine O
peritoneal O
macrophages O
with O
the O
mousepox O
virus. O
Furthermore, O
siRNA O
knockdown O
of O
cathepsin O
B O
and O
L O
in O
macrophage O
cell O
line O
RAW O
264.7 O
resulted O
in O
increased O
viral O
yield O
in O
supernatants O
collected O
48 O
h O
post O
infection O
(pi) O
with O
ECTV O
[ O
24 O
]. O

The O
distribution O
of O
aetiologic O
pathogens O
and O
foci O
might O
have O
been O
influenced O
by O
the O
restricted O
inclusion O
material O
comprising O
patients O
from O
medical O
wards O
and O
the O
ICU O
only. O
E. B-PATH
coli I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
pathogen, O
which O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
a O
previous O
study O
including O
all O
patients O
with O
bacteraemia O
in O
the O
same O
hospital O
[ O
41 O
]. O
S. B-PATH
aureus, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
was O
found O
in O
only O
six O
patients O
(7%). O
This O
incidence O
is O
lower O
than O
seen O
in O
many O
other O
studies O
(12–18%) O
based O
on O
positive O
blood O
cultures O
[ O
2 O
, O
41 O
, O

Our O
findings O
are O
supported O
by O
the O
National O
Register O
of O
Community-Acquired O
Sepsis O
of O
the O
Swedish O
Infectious O
Diseases O
Physicians O
Society, O
where O
S. B-PATH

was O
the O
causing O
pathogen O
in O
8–10% O
of O
cases O
during O
the O

period O

[ O

The O
high O
mortality O
in O
the O
subgroup O
of O
S. B-PATH

infections O
in O
our O
material O
(4/6) O
is O
deemed O
not O
to O
be O
representative O
but O
rather O
an O
effect O
of O
the O
small O
sample O
size. O
The O
prevalence O

in O

is O
low, O
and O
our O
finding O

low O

pathogens O
in O
this O
study O
is O
in O
line O
with O
Swedish O
resistance O
surveillance O
data O
[ O
43 O
]. O
Early O
antibiotic O
treatment O
was O
the O
main O
focus O
in O
this O
study, O
but O
data O
also O
revealed O
other O
important O
risk O
factors O
for O
mortality. O
Age, O
markers O
of O
severity O
of O
disease O
(maximum O
lactate O

and O
number O
of O
dysfunctioning O
organs) O
and O
treatment O
(limited O
level O
of O
care, O
haemodynamic O
stabilisation, O
administration O
of O
fluids O
and O
antibiotics) O
were O
all O
correlated O
to O
mortality O
in O
the O
univariate O
analysis. O
All O
are O
known O
risk O
factors O
relating O
to O
outcome O
[ O
39 O
, O
44 O
– O
47 O
]. O
The O
impact O
of O
treatment, O
including O
limit O
of O
level O
of O
care, O
is O
determined O
by O
the O
clinical O
management O
of O
the O
individual O
patient O
and O
thereby O
possible O
to O
modify O
in O
order O
to O
improve O
patient O
outcome. O
In O
the O
multivariable O
analysis, O
best O
fit O
was O
found O
for O
the O
model O
incorporating O
age, O
limited O
level O
of O
care O
and O
early O
appropriate O
antibiotic O
treatment O
as O
independent O
factors O
related O
to O
mortality. O
Patients O
with O

limitation O
had, O
as O
might O
be O
expected, O
a O
higher O
mortality O
rate O
[ O
46 O
, O
47 O
]. O
This O
is O
an O
important O
factor O
to O
consider. O

It O
is O
assumed O
that O
each O
species O
of O
the O
genus O
Steinernema O
establishes O
symbiosis O
with O
only O
one O
Xenorhabdus O
species; O
in O
turn, O
many O
Xenorhabdus O
species O
can O
be O
associated O
with O
several O
nematode O
species. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
symbiotic O
Heterorhabditis-Photorhabdus O
relationships O
are O
more O
flexible: O
many O
species, O
both O
bacteria O
and O
nematodes, O
are O
able O
to O
engage O
in O
symbiotic O
associations O
with O
multiple O
species O
of O
symbiotic O
partners O
(Koppenhöfer O
2007 O
; O
Koppenhöfer O
and O
Gaugler O
2009 O
). O
While O
plenty O
of O
data O
support O
this O
specificity O
pattern, O
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
it O
remain O
to O
be O
elucidated O
(Herbert O
and O
Goodrich-Blair O
2007 O
; O
Hillman O
and O
Goodrich-Blair O
2016 O
). O
Laboratory O
studies O
on O
the O
specificity O
of O
symbiotic O
associations O
are O
usually O
based O
on O
removal O
of O
native O
microsymbionts O
followed O
by O
re-association O
of O
nematode-bacterium O
pairs O
with O
non-native O
bacteria. O
Such O
experiments O
demonstrated O
strong O
partner O
preference, O
however O
with O
the O
potential O
for O
horizontal O
transfer O
of O
symbionts O
between O
different O
species O
of O
nematodes, O
depending O
on O
the O
bacterium-nematode O
pair O
used O
(e. O
g. O
Sicard O

Kazimierczak O

). O
In O
fact, O
the O
bacterial O
host-switching O
between O
nematode O
species, O
even O
those O
representing O
different O
clades, O
seems O
to O
be O
rare O
but O
possible, O
especially O
that O
associations O
of O
nematodes O
with O
new O
symbiotic O
partners O
may O
enable O
colonization O
of O
new O
niches O
or O
extend O
one O

conferring O
significant O
fitness O
benefits O
(Henry O
et O
al. O
2013 O
; O
Maher O
et O
al. O

). O
Nevertheless, O
the O
microsymbiont O
switching O
has O
most O
often O
a O
detrimental O
effect O
on O
the O
nematode O
host O
because O
association O
with O
non-cognate O
symbionts O
results O
in O
a O
decline O
in O
their O
reproduction O
fitness, O

carriage, O
and O
virulence. O

however, O

This O
observation O
can O

be O
explained O
by O
Pestoides O

maintaining O
specific O
variations O

Comparative O
genomics O

have O
revealed O
frameshifts, O

which O
may O
account O
for O

the O
ability O

has O
been O
lost O
by O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
although O
the O

this O

is O
not O
able O
to O

suggesting O
that O

in O
a O
way O
that O

ultimately O
reduced O

the O

The O
abundance O
of O
genes O
involved O
in O
carbohydrate O
and O
amino O
acid O
metabolism O
may O
suggest O
a O
nutritional O
role O
of O
the O
microbiota. O
The O
springtails O
used O
in O
this O
study O
were O
reared O
exclusively O
on O
baker’s O
yeast O
(Saccharomyces O

and O
specific O
microbial O
enzymes O
could O
aid O
in O
the O
breakdown O
of O
components O
of O
the O
fungal O
cell O

including O
various O
polysaccharides O
and O
glycoproteins O
47 O
. O
Natural O
populations O
of O
springtails O
may O
also O
benefit O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
such O
functions O
in O
their O
microbiome. O
In O
fact, O
carbohydrate-related O
functions O
are O
often O
enriched O
in O
the O
gut O
microbiome O
of O
different O
soil O
invertebrates, O
such O
as O

some O
of O
which O
rely O
on O

for O
the O
breakdown O
of O
long O

such O
as O

and O
other O
plant-derived O

F. O

is O
an O
euedaphic O
springtail O

whose O
natural O

includes O
not O
only O
yeasts O
and O
other O
fungi, O
commonly O
occurring O
in O
the O
soil O
environment, O
but O
also O
decaying O
plant O

Recently, O
the O
microbiota O
of O
another O
springtail O
species, O
the O
epiedaphic O
Orchesella O
cincta, O
was O
studied, O
and O
some O
of O
the O
main O
functions O
predicted O
based O
on O
the O
microbial O
community O
structure O
were O
related O
to O
the O
breakdown O
of O
dietary O
components O
and O
of O
plant O
secondary O
metabolites O
41 O
. O
In O
a O
previous O
study O
we O
observed O
substantial O
overlap O
in O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
bacterial O
communities O
between O
a O
lab-reared O
and O
a O
field O
population O
of O
springtails O
25 O
. O
This O
suggests O
that O
similar O
carbohydrate-degrading O
functions O
may O
be O
present O
in O
both O
lab-reared O
and O
field O
populations O
of O
springtails. O
Amino O
acid-related O
functions O
may O
also O
be O
beneficial O
for O
the O

Some O
intracellular O

biosynthesize O
essential O
amino O
acids O
that O
are O
lacking O
in O
the O
diet O
of O
their O
host O
2 O
and O
gut O
bacteria O
may O
exert O
similar O
functions O
50 O
. O
A O
contribution O
to O
the O

nutrition O
may O
also O
explain O
the O
abundance O
of O

Introduction O
Acinetobacter B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
is O
a O
growing O
threat O
that O
is O
responsible O
for O
numerous O
healthcare-associated O
infections, O
such O
as O
burn O
and O
wound O
infections O
[ O
1 O
]. O
It O
is O
among O
the O
leading O
causes O
of O
infections O
of O
the O
respiratory O
and O
urinary O
tracts, O
secondary O
meningitis, O
and O
sepsis O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Some O
strains O
of O
this O
widespread O
Gram-negative O
pathogen O
have O
been O
reported O
recently O
to O
be O
resistant O
to O
nearly O
all O
known O
antibiotics, O
and O
there O
is O
therefore O
an O
urgent O
need O
to O
find O
alternative O
treatments O
for O
these O
infections O
[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
1910s, O
it O
was O
suggested O
that O
bacteriophages O
could O
be O
used O
successfully O
for O
treatment O
of O
human O
infections O
[ O
5 O
]. O
In O
recent O
decades, O
several O
reports O
have O
revealed O
the O
existence O
of O
multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
strains O
with O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
resistance O
to O
β-lactam O
antibiotics, O
including O
cephalosporins O
and O
penicillins O
[ O
6 O
]. O
To O
combat O
MDR O
A. O
baumannii O
isolates, O
phages O
are O
now O
being O
considered O
as O
alternatives O
to O
antibiotics, O
a O
century O
after O
their O
discovery O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
recent O
decades, O
there O
has O
been O
increasing O
evidence O
of O
the O
feasibility O
of O
using O
phage O
therapy O
to O
treat O
drug-resistant O
bacterial O
infections O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Indeed, O
not O
only O
can O
active O
phage O
be O
applied O
directly O
in O
the O
clinic O
[ O
10 O
], O
but O
new O
potential O
phage-derived O
antimicrobial O
agents O
are O
being O
identified O
and O
certified O
[ O
11 O
]. O
Thus, O
bacteriophage O
therapy O
is O
a O
potential O
strategy O
to O
fight O
MDR O
A. O
baumannii. O
However, O
problems O
including O
narrow O
host O
range, O
unclear O
host-phage O
interactions, O
and O
safety O
issues O
largely O
limit O
its O
clinical O
application. O
Recently, O
we O
performed O
a O
national O
study O
of O
MDR O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
epidemiology O
in O
which O
a O
number O
of O
bacteriophages O
were O
screened O
and O
preserved. O
A O
novel O
phage O
with O
strong O
lytic O
efficiency O
in O
MDR O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
was O
isolated O
from O
wastewater O
from O
the O
intensive O
care O
unit O
of O
a O
burn O
treatment O
centre O
in O
southwestern O
China. O

NFκB O
luciferase O

Here, O
we O
present O
the O
characterization O
of O
a O
sRNA O
termed O
RssR O
that O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
MI O
degradation O
pathway O
in O
S. O
Typhimurium. O
We O
found O
that O
the O
sRNA O
RssR, O
whose O
gene O
rssR O
overlaps O
with O
the O
coding O
region O
and O
the O
3′-UTR O
of O
iolB, O
probably O
interacts O
with O
and O
stabilizes O
the O
mRNA O
of O
reiD O
via O
interaction O
with O
the O
5′-UTR, O
thus O
controlling O
the O
expression O
of O
this O
regulatory O
gene O
at O
the O
posttranscriptional O
level. O
Examples O
of O
sRNAs O
that O
activate O
gene O
expression O
upon O
interaction O
with O
a O
target O
mRNA O
by O
stemloop O
formation O
and O
via O
the O
5′-UTR O
have O
been O
described O
52 O
, O
58 O
. O
However, O
we O
do O
not O
exclude O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
phenotypes O
observed O
in O
this O
study O
are O
the O
indirect O
results O
from O
translation O
stimulation O
of O
reiD O
by O
sequestration O
of O
an O
anti-Shine O
Dalgarno O
sequence O
59 O
. O
In O
comparison O
with O
a O
strain O
lacking O
RssR, O
the O
presence O
of O
RssR O
results O
in O
a O
higher O
abundance O
of O
ReiD O
mRNA. O
The O
regulator O
then O
induces O
the O
genes O
iolE/iolG1 O
that O
are O
essential O
for O
MI O
degradation O
and O
encode O
the O
first O
enzymes O
of O
this O
pathway. O
Therefore, O
RssR O
positively O
regulates O
MI O
utilization O
by O
targeting O
reiD O
and O
promotes O
growth O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium O
in O
environments O
with O
MI O
as O
a O
carbon O
and O
energy O
source. O
Although O
the O
deletion O
of O
sRNA O
STnc1740 O
has O
a O
less O
prominent O
growth O
effect O
in O
comparison O
with O
that O
of O
RssR, O
its O
growth O
phenotype O
indicates O
that O
STnc1740 O
counteracts O
the O
effect O
of O
RssR O
by O
a O
yet O
unknown O
mechanism. O

However, O
the O

Cold O

is O
a O

Here, O

crucial O
roles O
in O
response O
to O
the O

of O

[ O

]. O
Evidences O

that O
Ca O
2+ O
influx O
was O
a O
very O
important O
change O
in O
membrane O
during O
cold O
stress O
[ O
36 O
]. O
Some O
genes O
have O
been O

to O
sense O

in O
intracellular O
Ca O
2+ O
levels O
via O

to O

[ O
37 O
]. O
In O
our O
study, O
we O
found O
related O
gene O
regulation O
for O
Ca O
2+ O
signaling. O
Calmodulin O
(CaM) O
gene O
was O
specifically O
found O
in O
SCZ O
and O
up-regulated O
during O
cold O
stress. O
Two O
calcineurin O
B-like O
protein O
(CBL) O
genes, O
three O
calcium-dependent O
protein O
kinase O
(CDPK) O
genes, O
one O
calmodulin-like O
protein O
(CML) O
genes O
and O
three O
CBL-interacting O
protein O
kinase O
(CIPK) O
genes O
were O
up-regulated O
during O
cold O
treatment O
in O
SCZ O
while O
only O
two O
CBP O
genes O
were O
up-regulated O
in O
YH9 O
(Additional O

In O
addition, O
fifteen O
receptor O

genes O
for O
phosphorylation O
were O
induced O
during O
cold O
treatment O
in O
SCZ O
and O
six O
were O
induced O
in O
YH9. O
Therefore, O
Ca O
2+ O

genes O
might O
contribute O
to O
higher O
cold O

in O
SCZ O
than O
YH9. O
FLS2, O

only O
SCZ, O
was O
a O
DEG O
involved O
in O
plant-pathogen O

in O

It O
is O
known O
that O
abiotic O

[ O

], O
perhaps O
as O
a O
way O
to O

We O
speculate O
that O
cold-induced O

may O
result O
from O
a O
common O
signaling O
process O
like O
those O
for O

It O
has O

. O
Similarly, O
we O
discovered O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
deletion O
in O
M. O
oryzae O
also O
resulted O
in O
fatty O
acids O
accumulation O
and O
utilization O
defects O
( O
Fig. O
3a,b O
). O
This O
result O
suggested O
the O
function O
of O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
in O
fatty O
acid O
metabolism O
was O
also O
conserved O
between O
human O
and O
M. O
oryzae. O
Furthermore, O
the O
deletion O
of O
M. O
oryzae O
ECH1, O
which O
catalyze O
the O
downstream O
of O
dehydrogenation O
in O
mitochondrial O
fatty O
acid O
β O
oxidation, O
displayed O
similar O
defects O
in O
fatty O
acid O
metabolism O
26 O
. O
These O
results O
further O
confirmed O
the O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
function O
in O
fatty O
acid O
metabolism. O
Human O
patients O
carrying O
ETFDH O
mutation O
were O
effectively O
cured O
by O
taking O
riboflavin O
over O
a O
long O
period O
33 O
, O
while O
our O
study O
did O
not O
find O
the O
exogenous O
riboflavin O
could O
rescue O
the O
defect O
of O
M. O
oryzae O
ETFDH O
mutant. O
This O
probably O
indicates O
a O
different O
riboflavin-response O
mechanism O
between O
human O
and O
fungal O
ETFDH. O
However, O
in O
M. O
oryzae, O
exogenously O
adding O
NaAC O
or O
Na O
2 O
CO O
3 O
could O
largely O
rescue O
the O
growth O
and O
conidiation O
defects O
in O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
( O
Fig. O
3b–d O
). O
As O
weak-base O
salts, O
NaAC O
or O
Na O
2 O
CO O
3 O
could O
counteract O
acids, O
so O
it O
can O
be O
concluded O
that O
the O
growth O
and O
conidiation O
defects O
of O
mutants O
were O
attributed O
to O
the O
fatty O
acids O
accumulation. O
Moreover, O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
released O
an O
unpleasant O
smell O
like O
butyrate O
when O
growing O
on O
CM O
medium, O
while O
the O
smell O
is O
relatively O
weak O
on O
MM O
medium. O
To O
confirm O
this O
smell, O
butyrate O
was O
added O
to O
MM O
medium O
as O
sole O
carbon O
source O
to O
test O
its O
effect O
to O
fungal O
growth. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
mutant O
growth O
and O
conidiation O
were O
obviously O
inhibited O
by O
butyrate O
as O
sole O
carbon O
source O
( O
Figs O
3a O
and O
S9a), O
which O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
effect O
when O
growing O
on O
CM O
medium. O

Areas O
that O
have O
received O
specific O
criticism O
due O
to O
their O
reliance O
on O
student O
sampling O
include O
research O
on O
economic O
decision O
making O
(Levitt O
and O
List O
2007 O
), O
socio-political O
attitudes O
(Schultz O
1969 O
), O
the O
psychological O
processes O
relating O
to O
prejudice O
(Henry O
2008 O
) O
and O
industrial O
and O
organisational O
psychology O
(Bergman O
and O
Jean O
2016 O
). O
Effect O
sizes O
calculated O
from O
student O
data O
can O
differ O
from O
other O
populations O
not O
merely O
in O
magnitude, O
but O
also O
in O
direction O
(Peterson O
2001 O
). O
Further, O
if O
researchers O
are O
interested O
in O
features O
of O
a O
variable O
(e.g. O
its O
range, O
distribution, O
mean), O
then O
it O
will O
not O
be O
possible O
to O
assess O
that O
accurately O
from O
a O
sample O
that O
is O
partially O
selected O
in O
relation O
to O
that O
variable: O
thus, O
population-level O
IQ O
scores O
cannot O
be O
assessed O
from O
student O
samples. O
Implications O
of O
Relying O
on O
Online O
Samples O
Our O
survey O
pointed O
to O
a O
substantial O
reliance O
(around O
one-quarter O
of O
all O
samples) O
on O
online O
data O
collection. O
It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
internet O
offers O
a O
practical O
solution O
to O
reliance O
upon O
WEIRD O
samples O
(Gosling O
et O
al. O
2004 O
). O
Advantages O
of O
online O
sampling O
include O
cheap, O
quick O
and O
convenient O
access O
to O
participants O
who O
can O
often O
be O
recruited O
in O
larger O
numbers O
than O
are O
readily O
available O
for O
offline O
studies, O
and O
this O
ease O
of O
access O
to O
large O
online O
samples O
appears O
to O
be O
reflected O
in O
our O
analyses O
above. O
Indeed, O
online O
sampling O
can O
reach O
a O
greater O
diversity O
of O
participants, O
including O
some O
difficult-to-reach O
and O
under-represented O
populations O
(Andrews O
et O
al. O
2003 O
). O
Further, O
the O
anonymous O
setting O
of O
an O
online O
survey O
might O
arguably O
provoke O
more O
honest O
answers O
to O
questions O
on O
sensitive O
topics, O
compared O
with O
lab O
data O
collection O
(Joinson O
1999 O
). O
From O
another O
perspective O
though, O
internet O
sampling O
is O
limited O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
kinds O
of O
research O
tools O
that O
can O
be O
used, O
and O
in O
addition O
internet O
access O
itself O
is O
only O
available O
to O
a O
proportion O
of O
the O
population O
(and O
in O
some O
countries, O
a O
smaller O
proportion O
of O
the O
population O
than O
those O
who O
constitute O
undergraduate O
samples O
in O
other O
countries), O
meaning O
that O
the O
sample O
is O
still O
restricted O
(Gosling O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Researchers O
sometimes O
raise O
concerns O
that O
data O
collected O
via O
online O
sampling O
might O
be O
of O
lower O
quality O
than O
that O
collected O
using O
more O
traditional O
methods O
(e.g. O
Matzat O
and O
Snijders O
2010 O
; O
Paolacci O
and O

There O
are O
some O
studies O
of O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
associated O
with O
drug O
injection O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
]. O
One O
study O
found O
that O
54% O
of O
drug O
users O
with O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
developed O
the O
infection O
at O
an O
injection O
site O
[ O
10 O
]. O
The O
same O
study O
showed O
that O
S. O
pyogenes O
was O
the O
third O
most O
frequently O
detected O
gram-positive O
aerobe, O
following O
Staphylococcus O
aureus O
and O
viridans O
streptococci. O
Another O
study O
revealed O
that O
patients O
with O
a O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
after O
injection O
or O
infiltration O
therapy O
have O
a O
poor O
prognosis O
in O
terms O
of O
survival O
and O
amputation O
rate O
[ O
11 O
]. O
In O
our O
case, O
redness O
and O
swelling O
spread O
from O
peripheral O
infusion O
cannulation O
sites O
on O
both O
forearms. O
Thus, O
the O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
infection O
might O
have O
originated O
from O
the O
injection O
sites. O
However, O
it O
is O
considered O
that O
the O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
was O
spread O
from O
primary O
peritonitis O
via O
bloodstream O
infection O
which O
caused O
septic O
shock O
at O
ICU O
admission. O
The O
reason O
is O
that O
S. O
pyogenes O
species O
which O
had O
the O
same O
sensitivity O
to O
antibiotics O
were O
detected O
from O
ascites, O
blood, O
and O
skins O
in O
both O
arms. O
Then, O
as O
of O
ICU O
admission, O
there O
were O
no O
inflammation O
signs O
in O
the O
limbs O
even O
though O
peritonitis O
and O
sepsis O
had O
already O
occurred. O
Furthermore, O
she O
developed O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
concurrently O
in O
both O
arms O
which O
were O
apart O
from O
each O
other. O
It O
seems O
questionable O
if O
the O
bacteria O
involved O
in O
the O
fasciitis O
invaded O
from O
the O
skin. O
Additionally, O
this O
S. O
pyogenes O
lineage O
comprised O
emm89-type O
strains O
and O
carried O
a O
mutation O
in O
covS O
gene. O
This O
group O
produces O
many O
surface-bound O
and O
extracellular O
virulence O
factors O
that O
contribute O
to O
pathogenesis O
in O
complex O
ways. O
CovS/CovR O
is O
a O
key O

system O
of O

hospitalized O
in O
the O
Internal O
Ward, O
but O
no O
tentative O
diagnosis O
was O
established, O
except O
chronic O
tonsillitis O
(he O
was O
classified O
among O
surgery O
treatment). O
Previously, O
he O
was O
also O
suffered O
from O
skin O
Streptococcus B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
and O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
mixed O
infection. O
No O
history O
of O
previous O
travels. O
On O
admission O
to O
the O
Clinic, O
he O
was O
afebrile. O
Physical O
examination O
revealed O
presence O
of O
cervical O
and O
axillar O
lymphadenopathy O
and O
increased O
bowel O
movements. O
Blood O
tests O
confirmed O
an O
internal O
inflammation O
(elevated O
levels O
of O
ESR O
36 O
mm/h, O

31.8 O

Because O
of O
diarrhea, O
stool O

was O
performed. O
Bacteriological O
culture O
according O
to O
enteropathogenic O
bacteria O
(Salmonella O

Shigella O
spp., O
E.coli O
ETEC, O
Yersinia O
spp., O
Campylobacter O
spp., O
Clostridium O
difficile) O
was O
negative. O

This O
latter O
woman O
also O
affirmed O
that, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
that O
event, O
she O
would O
no O
longer O
eat O
any O
kind O
of O
mushroom. O
This O
story O
had O
repercussions O
because O
the O
sale O
of O
white O
button O
mushrooms O
was O
then O
halted O
in O
the O
markets O
and O
stores O
of O
the O
municipality. O
Accordingly, O
and O
since O
then, O
it O
is O
not O
common O
to O
find O
this O
product O
and O
when O
on O
sale O
the O
locals O
do O
not O
buy O
it. O
Furthermore, O
it O
was O
believed O
among O
some O
families O
that O
domestic O
animals O
could O
take O
possession O
of O
the O
sickness O
and O
sacrifice O
themselves O
for O
their O
owners. O
In O
one O
reported O
case O
of O
intoxication, O
a O
mestizo O
child O
was O
considered O
to O
have O
only O
suffered O
minor O
complaints O
because O
his O
horse O
had O
died O
to O
save O
him. O
The O
transmission O
of O
knowledge O
of O
how O
to O
recognize O
mushrooms O
had O
not O
been O
significantly O
modified O
in O
the O
region. O
The O
Wixaritari O
were O
able O
to O
identify O
clear O
distinctive O
characteristics O
of O
toxic O
versus O
edible O
mushrooms, O
mainly O
using O
visual O
clues O
and O
smell, O
but O
not O
the O
taste. O
This O
could O
explain O
why O
the O
intoxications O
reported O
by O
the O
Wixaritari O
were O
only O
caused O
by O
species O
of O
Russula. O
Species O
with O
red O
caps O
(pilei) O
which O
are O
traditionally O
eaten O
could O
be O
confused O
with O
the O
R. O
emetica O
group, O
which O
are O
similar O
at O
first O
sight O
but O
can O
be O
distinguished O
by O
their O
peppery O
taste O
(Hallock O
2007 O
). O
Amanita O
species O
with O
white O
basidiomes O
from O
the O
A. O
bisporigera O
group O
were O
seen O
in O
the O
study O
area O
but O
not O
collected O
as O
neither O
the O
Wixaritari O
nor O
the O
mestizos O
recognized O
them O
and O
did O
not O
give O
them O
any O
attention. O
The O
treatment O
of O
intoxications, O
including O
the O
perception O
of O
the O
intoxication, O
differed O
between O
the O
cultural O
groups. O
Nevertheless, O
in O
both O
vomiting O
was O
seen O
as O
the O
remedy O
when O
symptoms O
presented; O
specific O
remedies O
to O
treat O
intoxications O
were O
not O
recorded. O
Hierophanic O
mushrooms O
We O
obtained O
a O
testimony O
of O
the O
use O
of O
psychoactive O
mushrooms O
by O
an O
elderly O
Wixarika O
woman O
as O
a O
hierophanic O
agent O
—one O
that O
gave O
a O
view O
of O
the O
divine. O
According O
to O
this O
woman O
and O
her O
family, O
the O
mushrooms O
selected O
her O
because O
their O
consumption O
by O
her O
was O
not O
premeditated. O

Yet, O

on O
a O

Background O
Although O
infrequent, O
non-typhoidal O
salmonellae O
are O
important O
causes O
of O
bacterial O

[ O

The O
emergence O
of O
non-typhoidal O
Salmonella O

in O
HIV O

poses O
a O
significant O
therapeutic O
challenge. O
These O

morbidity O
and O
mortality, O
despite O
prompt O
and O
appropriate O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
[ O

This O
is O

true O
for O

who O
present O
with O
a O

Colistin O

human O
non-typhoidal O

but O
has O
been O
increasingly O
reported O
in O
animal O

posing O
a O
potential O

to O
humans O
[ O

]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
increasing O
emergence O

threatens O
the O
future O
utility O
of O
this O
essential O

[ O

We O
report O
an O
interesting O
case O
of O
fatal O
meningitis O
caused O
by O
a O
colistin O

Salmonella O

in O
a O

Case O

A O
34-year-old O
male O
presented O
to O
the O

at O
a O
tertiary O

in O
Pretoria, O
South O

with O
a O
one-month O
history O
of O
headache, O
non-productive O
cough, O
fever, O
loss O
of O
weight O
and O
generalised O
body O
pain. O
The O
symptoms O
worsened O
over O
the O
preceding O
week, O
notably O
the O
fever O
and O
headache O
with O
associated O
neck O
pain O
and O
acute O
confusion. O
It O
was O
not O
known O
if O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
history O
of O
diarrhoea O
preceding O
presentation O
to O
hospital. O
He O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
HIV O
infection O
approximately O
2 O
years O
prior. O
His O
CD4 O
count O
was O
2 O
cells/μL O
on O
admission O
and O
HIV O
viral O
load O
was O
49,925 O
copies/mL O
6 O
months O
earlier. O
His O
accompanying O
relative O
reported O
that O
he O
had O
been O
taking O
fixed O
dose O
combination O
antiretroviral O
therapy O
i.e., O
tenofovir, O
emtricitibine O
and O
efavirenz, O
but O
had O
defaulted O
treatment. O
On O
examination, O
vital O
signs O
were O
all O
within O
normal O
limits. O

It O
is O
postulated O
that O
insertion O
of O
an O
IS O
element O
in O
the O
spaC O
promoter O
region O
in O
both O
L. O

allows O
the O
expression O
of O
the O

genes O
(Douillard O
et O
al. O
2013 O
; O
Aleksandrzak-Piekarczyk O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Notably, O
the O
upstream O
region O
of O
the O
IBB3423 O
spaCBA O
operon O
harbored O
by O
pLCAKO.2 O
also O
contains O
an O
insertion O
element O
indicating O
that O
it O
likely O
is O
functional. O
Indeed, O
the O
removal O
of O
pLCAKO.2 O
led O
to O
a O
marked O
decrease O
of O
IBB3423 O
hydrophobicity O
and O
adhesiveness O
to O
biotic O
and O
abiotic O
surfaces. O
The O
presence O
of O
such O
a O
plasmid O
should O
therefore O
facilitate O
colonization O
and O
ensure O
longer O
persistence O
in O
the O
host’s O
gut O
thereby O
conferring O
a O
competitive O
advantage O
over O
other O
bacteria. O
It O
can O
also O
increase O
the O
range O
of O

Plasmidic O
localization O
of O
the O
spaCBA O
operon, O
such O
as O
in O
IBB3423, O
is O
extremely O

albeit O
not O

In O
conclusion, O
the O
newly O

dairy O
strain O
L. O
paracasei O
subsp. O
paracasei O
IBB3423 O
presents O
genomic O
and O
functional O
features O
making O
it O
a O
very O
promising O

probiotic. O
Owing O
to O
its O
high O
adhesiveness O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
the O
benchmark O

L. O
rhamnosus O
GG O
and O
the O
ability O
to O
use O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
saccharides O
including O
inulin, O
it O
should O
be O
able O
to O
compete O
with O
other O
commercially O
applied O
strains. O
However, O
additional O
functional O
studies O
in O

and O
in O
vivo O
should O
be O
performed O
to O
determine O
whether O
IBB3423 O
can O
persist O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
and O
exhibits O
health-promoting O
action. O

The O
discrimination O
of O
the O
different O
serotypes O
depends O
on O
type-specific O
capsular O
polysaccharides O
that O
constitute O
also O
a O
virulence O
factor, O
through O
which O
GBS O
eludes O
the O
host O
immune O

[ O

However, O
the O
expression O
of O

polysaccharides O
at O
the O
extracellular O
level O
is O
not O
the O
only O
invasion O

Indeed, O
analogously O
to O

S. O

is O
able O
to O

Despite O
these O
pathogenic O
features, O
S. O
agalactiae O
is O
generally O
harmless O
for O
human O
health, O
being O
a O
commensal O
commonly O
present O
in O
the O
lower O
genital O
and O
gastroenteric O
tract O
of O
healthy O
women O
[ O

]. O
The O
screening O
for O
the O
identification O
of O
GBS O
becomes O
essential O
in O
pregnant O
women, O
due O
to O
a O
serious O
risk O
for O
newborn O
to O
contract O
the O
infection O
during O
birth. O
Data O
regarding O
the O
incidence O
of O
S. B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
infections O
in O
newborns O
are O
decidedly O
not O
encouraging. O
Accordingly, O
S. B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
is O
responsible O
for O
between O
114,000 O
and O
204,000 O
invasive O
cases O
and O
147,000 O
stillbirths O
and O
infant O
deaths O
every O
year O
worldwide. O
Furthermore, O
the O
neonatal O
mortality O
rates, O
ranging O
from O
10 O
to O
15% O
and O
40 O
to O
58% O
in O
developed O
and O
developing O
countries, O
respectively, O
clearly O
confirm O
that O
vertical O
transmission O
of O
S. B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
still O
represents O
an O
emergency O
worldwide O
[ O
8 O
– O

These O
numbers O
reflect O
a O
diffused O
and O
homogeneous O
vaginal O
and O

GBS O
colonization O
among O
pregnant O
women O
worldwide, O
with O
some O
variations O
between O
the O
different O
regions O
of O
the O

In O
Europe, O
the O
variation O
of O
the O

rate O
is O
around O
7.1 O
to O
16% O
[ O
11 O
, O

Interestingly, O
although O
S. O
agalactiae O
colonization O
rates O
are O
similar O
worldwide, O
serotype O

is O
geographically O
high O

[ O

In O
Europe O
and O

Presently, O
more O
than O
20 O
Leishmania O
species O
are O
known O
to O
infect O
humans O
via O
the O
female O
phlebotomine O
sandflies. O
Looking O
at O
their O
geographical O
distribution O
and O
the O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
the O
infection, O
these O
parasites O
are O
among O
the O
most O
diverse O
human O
pathogens. O
Clinically, O
we O
have O
visceral O
leishmaniasis O
(VL) O
which O
is O
the O
most O
serious O
form O
of O
the O
disease, O
cutaneous O
leishmaniasis O
(CL), O
the O
most O
common O
and O
mucocutaneous O
leishmaniasis O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Worldwide, O
350 O
million O
people O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
acquiring O
these O
diseases. O
In O
2017, O
97 O
countries O
and O
territories O
were O
endemic O
for O
leishmaniasis. O
20792 O
new O
cases O
were O
reported O
among O
which O
22145 O
(94%) O
occurred O
in O
seven O
countries O
including O
Brazil, O
Ethiopia, O
India, O
Kenya, O
Somalia, O
South O
Sudan O
and O
Sudan O
[ O
14 O
]. O
In O
disease-endemic O
areas, O
many O
infected O
individuals O
remain O
asymptomatic O
for O
prolonged O
durations O
[ O
15 O
]. O
However, O
in O
a O
state O
of O
compromised O
immunity O
such O
as O
in O
HIV O
infection, O
the O
progression O
from O
the O
asymptomatic O
to O
symptomatic O
visceral O
or O
cutaneous O
forms O
can O
substantially O
increase O
[ O
16 O
, O
17 O
]. O
The O
HIV O
patients O
co-infected O
with O
VL O
are O
particularly O
difficult O
to O
treat O
and O
are O
also O
associated O
with O
increased O
rates O
of O
relapse, O
mortality O
and O
high O
transmission O
[ O
18 O
, O
19 O
]. O
Presently, O
treatments O
for O
leishmaniasis O
are O
limited O
to O
a O
few O
drugs O
including O
pentavalent O
antimonials, O
amphotericin O
B, O
paromomycin, O
and O
miltefosine, O
the O
only O
oral O
treatment O
available. O
However, O
serious O
drawbacks O
including O
prolonged O
treatment O
duration, O
parenteral O
administration, O
low O
tolerability, O
teratogenicity, O
treatment O
failures, O
the O
requirement O
for O
cold O
storage O
and O
high O
cost O
have O
been O
reported O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
Moreover, O
the O
efficacy O
of O
these O
drugs O
varies O
from O
one O
geographical O
location O
to O
another O
[ O
22 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
low-cost, O
safe, O
effective, O
oral, O
short-course O
drug O
and O
suitable O
for O
use O
in O
pregnancy O
is O
desperately O
needed O
[ O

Their O

due O

However, O
when O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
from O
either O
fungi O
or O
plants O
are O
expressed O
in O
the O
normally O
CLO/PXG O
genes-deficient O
yeast, O
Saccharomyces O
cerevisiae, O
the O
genes O
are O
expressed O
and O
active O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
are O
produced, O
leading O
to O
increased O
accumulation O
of O
intracellular O
lipid O
droplets O
that O
harbour O
these O
proteins O
[ O
2 O
, O
47 O
]. O
Another O
interesting O
CLO/PXG-containing O
fungus O
is O
the O
basidiomycetous O
yeast, O
Rhodosporidium O
toruloides, O
which O
has O
biotechnological O
uses O
as O
a O
producer O
of O
carotenes O
and O
triacylglycerols. O
Although O
the O
genome O
of O
this O
species O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
fully O
sequenced, O
laboratory O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
are O
highly O
induced O
in O
response O
to O
nitrogen O
starvation O
and O
that O
the O
resultant O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
are O
one O
of O
the O
two O
major O
components O
of O
the O
lipid O
droplet O
proteome O
[ O
11 O
]. O
Since O
the O
overexpression O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
in O
Saccharomyces O
cerevisiae O
leads O
to O
increased O
triacylglycerol O
accumulation O
[ O
2 O
, O
47 O
], O
the O
manipulation O
of O
these O
genes O
in O
other O
commercially O
useful O
lipogenic O
fungi O
could O
be O
part O
of O
a O
biotechnological O
approach O
to O
increasing O
lipid O
production O
for O
use O
in O
oleochemicals, O
foods O
or O
biofuels. O
Given O
our O
recent O
demonstration O
of O
the O
close O
relationship O
between O
CLO/PXG O
proteins, O
lipid O
droplet O
dynamics O
and O
aflatoxin O

and O
export O
in O
A. O

[ O

], O
further O
studies O
on O
the O
wider O
roles O
of O
these O
proteins O
are O
definitely O
merited. O
In O
terms O
of O
the O
origins O
and O
current O
distribution O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
in O
eukaryotes O
we O
suggest O
that O
these O
genes O
were O
present O
in O
the O
last O
eukaryote O
common O
ancestor O
(LECA) O
that O
pre-dated O

Retracing O
the O

of O

since O
its O

that O

For O

investigations O
into O
the O

have O
uncovered O
only O

genetic O

The O
increasing O
genomic O

of O
global O
Y. O
pestis O
isolates O
have O
revealed O
that O
it O
has O
evolved O
clonally O
with O
little O
genetic O
diversity; O
however, O
it O
is O
becoming O
apparent O
that O
these O
small O
genetic O

resulting O
in O
the O
change O
of O
its O
transmission O
have O
been O
strongly O
positively O
selected O
for O
during O
its O
evolution. O
The O
emergence O
of O

has O
been O
directly O
linked O
with O
both O
the O
gain O
and O
loss O
of O
genetic O
elements O
by O
bacteria O
that O
were O
previously O
thought O
to O
be O
non-virulent O

. O
Moreover, O

been O

fundamental O
effects O
on O
an O

evolutionary O
adaptation O

52 O

Indeed, O
our O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
emergence O
of O

could O
occur O
similarly O
via O
relatively O
small O

Taken O
together, O
our O

that O

to O
cause O
an O
acute O

early O
on O

Background O
Nitrogen O
is O
an O
indispensable O
element O
for O
all O
living O
organisms, O
and O
its O
uptake O
and O
utilization O
are O
the O
major O
limiting O
factors O
for O
plant O
growth O
and O

yield O
[ O

As O
an O

nitrogen O
is O
the O
key O
component O
of O
biological O
macromolecules O
such O
as O
proteins, O
nucleic O

vitamins O
and O
hormones. O
Thus, O
uptake O
and O
utilization O
of O
nitrogen O
affect O
nearly O
all O
biological O
processes O
and O
are O
tightly O
regulated O
[ O

Ammonium O

which O
are O
absorbed O
and O
transported O
into O
plant O

by O
AMTs O
and O
NRTs O
(nitrate O

respectively, O
are O
the O
main O
plant O
available O
inorganic O
forms O
of O
nitrogen O
in O

Because O

[ O

After O

is O
assimilated O
into O
glutamate O
via O
the O

for O
the O

In O

[ O

According O
to O
their O

these O

into O
two O
subfamilies, O
AMT1 O

The O
virulence O
genes O
of O
the O
mutant O
strain O
in O
this O
study O
were O
worth O
exploring O
at O
the O
transcription O
level. O
Although O
both O
the O
parental O
and O
mutant O
strains O
were O
cleared O
at O
a O
very O
low O
level, O
the O
decrease O
in O
the O
viable O
count O
of O
the O
parental O
strain O
within O
24 O
h O
was O
gradual, O
and O
the O
number O
of O
colonies O
was O
gradually O
reduced O
from O
10 O
3 O
CFU O
to O
10 O
1 O
CFU. O
However, O
there O
were O
two O
mutant O
strains O
that O
were O
both O
at O
very O
low O
levels. O
In O
particular, O
its O
colonization O
could O
not O
complete O
within O
the O
trachea, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
mutant O
strain O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
able O
to O
fight O
clearance O
from O
the O
immune O
system. O
Studies O
in O
E. O
coli O
Δlon O
strains O
suggested O
that O
rpoB O
mutants O
could O
reduce O
the O
expression O
of O
capsular O
polysaccharide O
synthesis O
genes O
in O
this O
strain. O
Capsular O
polysaccharides O
could O
help O
the O
cells O
to O
fight O
immune O
mechanisms O
in O
vivo O
[ O
35 O
]. O
Considering O
the O
crucial O
role O
of O
RNA O
polymerase O
in O
transcription, O
studying O
transcriptome O
changes O
in O
mutants O
would O
provide O
useful O
information. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
ability O
of O
mutants O
to O
resist O
hydrogen O
peroxide O
and O
NO O
was O
decreased O
in O
an O
in O
vitro O
sensitivity O
experiment. O
This O
result O
also O
supported O
the O
results O
of O
colonization O
experiments O
in O
vivo. O
Both O
active O
oxygen O
and O
reactive O
nitrogen O
in O
vivo O
were O
the O
environmental O
pressures O
that O
the O
bacteria O
would O
encounter. O
The O
defense O
against O
oxidative O
stress O
was O
crucial O
for O
the O
survival O
of O
bacteria O
in O
the O
body O
[ O
36 O
]. O
So O
far, O
the O
rpoB O
mutant O
has O
not O
been O
characterized O
in O
detail O
and O
may O
lack O
sufficient O
attention. O
The O
lacking O
dose O
of O
rifampin O
in O
use O
and O
the O
residual O
drug O
in O
the O
environment O
may O
provide O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
with O
the O
stress O
condition O
required O
for O
spontaneous O
mutation. O
The O
fitness O
cost O
of O
rpoB O
mutation O
may O
be O
due O
to O
changes O
in O
gene O
transcription O
level, O
and O
transcriptome O
analysis O
of O
mutant O
strains O
will O
be O
of O
great O
value. O
Therefore, O
further O
investigation O
and O
evaluation O
are O
necessary. O
Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
R. O
anatipestifer O
rifampin O
resistance O
is O
mainly O
derived O
from O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
mutation, O
whose O
types O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
strain O
background O
and O
environment O
stress. O
The O
spontaneous O
mutation O
of O
rpoB O
gene O
is O
concentrated O
in O
the O
mutation O
type O
with O
low O
fitness O
cost. O

Indeed, O
as O
adulthood O
approaches, O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
stabilizes, O
becomes O
more O
diverse, O
and O
can O
resist O
detrimental O
environmental O
elements O
such O
as O
antibiotics O
and O
stress O
by O
restoring O
its O
diverse O
and O
stable O
‘normal’ O
core O
microbiota O
(Palmer O
et O
al., O
2007 O
; O
Rajilic-Stojanovic O
et O
al., O
2011 O
). O
However, O
as O
we O
age, O
the O
diversity O
and O
stability O
of O
our O
microbiota O
will O
decline O
(Biagi O
et O
al., O
2010 O
), O
moreover O
there O
is O
an O
associated O
increase O
in O
number, O
size O
and O
activation O
of O
microglia O
that O
can O
lead O
to O
an O
increased O
inflammatory O
tone O
named O
‘inflammaging’ O
(Franceschi, O
2007 O
; O
von O
Bernhardi O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
There O
is O
high O
heterogeneity O
of O
microglia O
in O
several O
neurodegenerative O
diseases, O
including O
AD O
and O
those O
phenotypes O
share O
common O
characteristics O
with O
aging O
(Bachstetter O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
In O
normal O
aging, O
close O
crosstalk O
with O
astrocytes, O
neurons O
and O
other O
brain O
cells O
serve O
crucial O
functions O
as O
the O
scavenger O
system O
of O
the O
CNS, O
providing O
beneficial O
functions O
such O
as O
tissue O
repair O
in O
the O
CNS. O
However, O
chronic, O
dysregulated O
activation O
of O
microglia O
can O
lead O
to O
elevated O
inflammatory O
tone O
ultimately O
resulting O
in O
the O
malfunction O
or O
damage O
of O
brain O
cells. O
The O
role O
of O
the O
microbiota O
in O
addition O
to O
what O
drives O
this O
dysregulation O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
fully O
understood. O
AD O
mice O
and O

A O
recent O

between O

and O
healthy O

and O
strongly O
advocated O
that O
a O

the O

it O

that O

In O
the O

Davis O
et O

present O
an O
elegant O
approach O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
contamination O
in O
metagenomic O
sequencing O
results O
[ O
22 O
]. O
Their O
approach O
relies O
on O
two O
core O
principles: O
first, O
that O
contaminant O
sequences O
are O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
total O
sequencing O
reads O
(the O
frequency-based O
approach), O
and O
second, O
that O
contaminant O
sequences O
are O
present O
in O
more O
controls O
than O
samples O
(the O
prevalence-based O
approach). O
Their O
work O
employs O
several O
statistical O
methods O
that O
culminate O
in O
a O
classification O
threshold O
ranging O
from O
0 O
to O
1. O
Once O
the O
threshold O
is O
set O
(the O
authors O
recommend O
0.1 O
to O
start), O
a O
list O
of O
contaminant O
DNA O
can O
be O
compiled. O
Analyzing O
sequences O
according O
to O
these O
principles O
eliminates O
the O
need O
to O
assign O
an O
arbitrary O
threshold O
for O
removing O
sequences O
and O
reduces O
reliance O
on O
an O
a O
priori O
set O
list O
of O
known O
contaminants. O
Davis O
et O
al. O
then O
provide O
a O
user-friendly O
R O
package O

their O
approach O
on O
multiple O

in O
both O
shotgun O
and O

The O
approach O
employed O
by O
Davis O

is O
particularly O
useful O
in O
identifying O
contamination O
in O
low O
biomass O
samples, O
and O
the O
authors O
rightly O
point O
out O
that O
the O
assumptions O
of O
their O
approach O
break O
down O
when O
the O

mass O
(C) O

the O

Introduction O
The O

protects O
from O

agents, O
and O
regulate O
immune O
and, O
most O
likely, O
nerve O

to O
them O
1 O
– O
3 O
. O
There O
are O
two O
important O
barrier O
structures O
in O
the O
epidermis O
of O
the O
skin, O
the O
cornified O

and O
tight O

(TJs) O
formed O
in O
the O
granular O
layer O
(stratum O

right O
underneath O
the O
cornified O
layer. O
The O
genetic O
polymorphism O
affecting O
the O
cornified O

integrity O
has O
been O
found O
to O
be O
a O
causal O
factor O
of O
atopic O
dermatitis O
(AD) O
1 O
. O
In O
addition, O
decreased O
expression O
of O
the O
key O
TJ O
protein O
has O
been O
suggested O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
development O
of O
AD O
4 O
– O
6 O
. O
Epidermal O
nerve O
fibers O
are O
unencapsulated O
nerve O
endings O
that O
detect O
noxious O
stimuli O
to O
conduct O
pain. O
In O
addition, O
sensory O
neurons O
innervating O
the O
epidermis O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
itch O
induction O
7 O
, O
8 O
. O
Although O
unproven, O
it O
has O
been O
suspected O
that O
epidermal O
nerves O
are O
aberrantly O
activated O
by O
overexposure O
to O
environmental O
stimuli O
during O
the O
development O
of O
AD O
due O
to O
the O
impaired O
protection O
by O
the O
epidermal O
barrier O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
For O
the O
protection O
of O
epidermal O
nerves, O
the O
barrier O
structure O
should O
homeostatically O
cover O
over O
the O
nerves. O
However, O
anatomical O
relationship O
between O
the O
barrier O
structures O
and O
epidermal O
nerves O
during O
turnover O
of O
the O
epidermis O
has O
not O
been O
demonstrated. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
show O
that O
epidermal O
sensory O
nerves O
are O
contained O
underneath O
keratinocyte O
TJs O
in O
the O
normal O
skin, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
at O
least O
partly O
due O
to O
nerve O
pruning O
at O
newly O
forming O
TJs. O
Our O
data O
also O
suggest O
that O
during O
the O
development O
of O
chronic O
itch O
caused O
by O
epidermal O
barrier O
impairment, O
this O
dynamic O
anatomical O
relationship O
is O
disrupted, O
and O
epidermal O

are O
aberrantly O
activated. O

Thus, O
φAbp2 O
was O
designated O
to O
the O

φAbp2 O
The O
life O
cycle O
of O
φAbp2 O
was O
investigated O
by O
performing O
a O
one-step O
growth O
experiment. O
The O
duration O
of O
the O
latent O

was O
short O
(~ O

and O
was O
followed O
by O
a O

lasted O
50 O

The O
burst O
size O
was O
222 O
phage O
particles O

infected O
cell O
after O
100 O
min O
(Supplementary O

Moreover, O
φAbp2 O
was O
stable O
at O
temperatures O
ranging O
from O
-80 O
to O
20 O
°C. O
However, O
the O
viral O

decreased O
slightly O
at O

°C O
and O
were O
reduced O
dramatically O
at O
60 O

(Supplementary O

In O
addition, O
the O
pH O
tolerance O
of O
φAbp2 O
was O
stable O
over O
a O
broad O
range O
(from O
5.0–10.0). O
However, O
the O
titre O
dropped O
significantly O
at O
pH O
4.0 O
and O

11.0 O
(Supplementary O

All O

the O

that O

In O
Ethiopia, O
rigorous O
decontamination O
of O
reusable O
medical O
equipment O
is O
an O
important O
part O
of O
infection O
prevention O
and O
patient O
safety O
strategy O
[ O
8 O
]. O
However, O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
effort O
have O
not O
been O
felt O
across O
the O
country O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
healthcare O
workers O
have O
sub-optimal O
infection O
prevention O
practice O
in O
Ethiopia O
[ O
10 O
, O
13 O
– O
15 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
contamination O
of O
medical O
equipment O
with O
potential O
pathogens O
like O
S. B-PATH
aureus, I-PATH
Klebsiella O
spp., O
Citrobacter O
spp., O
Salmonella O
spp., O
Proteus O
spp., O
Enterobacter O
spp., O
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa, I-PATH
and O
E. B-PATH
coli I-PATH
is O
reported O
[ O
16 O
]. O
Moreover, O
concerns O
have O
been O
raised O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
HAIs O
[ O
17 O
– O
19 O
]. O
Given O
the O
reality O
that O
poor O
decontamination O
of O
patient O
equipment O
can O
result O
in O
a O
range O
of O
infections O
and O
contributing O
factor O
for O
HAIs O
[ O
3 O
, O
20 O
]. O
So O
far O
different O
studies O
were O
conducted O
in O
the O
area O
of O
infection O
prevention O
in O
Ethiopia O
[ O
13 O
– O
15 O
, O
21 O
]. O
However, O
none O
of O
the O
previously O
conducted O
studies O
assessed O
the O
decontamination O
practice O
of O
healthcare O
workers O
particularly O
among O
nursing O
staffs; O
where O
decontamination O
most O
commonly O
performed O
by O
nurses O
in O
hospital O
settings O
in O
Ethiopia. O
The O
only O
available O
study O
in O
the O
country O
on O
instrument O
processing O
practice O
does O
not O
include O
hospitals O
[ O
10 O
]. O
And O
it O
identified O
factors O
that O
influenced O
decontamination O
practice O
such O
as; O
high-risk O
perception, O
knowledgeable O
on O
instrument O
processing, O
attitude O
towards O
infection O
prevention, O
and O
presence O
of O
SOP O
or O
guideline O
in O
workplace O
targeted O
on O
instrument O
decontamination O
[ O
10 O
]. O
Even O
though O
these O
factors O
are O
from O
a O
single O
study O
conducted O
in O
the O
health O
centers, O
my O
study O
has O
included O
and O
attested O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
variables O
in O
the O
hospital O
setting. O
As O
far O
as O
I O
know, O
in O
southeast O
Ethiopia, O
there O
is O
no O
available O
information O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
issues O
of O
medical O
equipment O
decontamination O
practice O
among O
nurses. O
As O
a O
result, O
assessment O
of O
the O
current O
reusable O
medical O
equipment O
decontamination O
practice O
is O
timely. O
Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
assess O
decontamination O
practice O
and O
associated O
factors O
among O
nurses O
in O
hospitals O
of O
the O
southeast, O
Ethiopia. O

HCA O

showed O
similar O

CA O

It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
cancer O
was O
more O
commonly O
associated O
with O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
bacteremia O
patients O
than O
CA O
bacteremia O
patients O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
, O
25 O
]. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
however, O
cerebral O
vascular O
disease O
and O
hypertension O
were O
more O
associated O
with O
HCA O
infections O
compared O
to O
CA O
infections. O
This O
discrepancy O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
regional O
differences O
in O
underlying O
diseases. O
Indeed, O
cerebral O
vascular O
disease O
and O
hypertension O
are O
epidemics O
in O
Chinese O
communities O
[ O
26 O
, O
27 O
]. O
Patients O
with O
these O
diseases O
have O
a O
greater O
demand O
for O
medical O
care O
services. O
In O
this O
study, O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
rates O
were O
similar O
for O
patients O
with O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
infections O
and O
both O
patients O
exhibited O
significantly O
higher O
30-day O
mortality O
rates O
than O
CA O
infection O
patients. O
These O
results O
were O
similar O
to O
other O
studies O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
] O
and O
may O
largely O
be O
due O
to O
the O
variation O
in O
underlying O
diseases O
between O
the O
three O
groups, O
which O
are O
classical O
risk O
factors O
for O
prognosis O
of O
infectious O
diseases. O
An O
important O
finding O
in O
this O
study O
was O
that O
HCA O
K. O
pneumoniae O
strains O
exhibited O
similar O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
patterns O
with O
nosocomial O
strains, O
and O
both O
the O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
strains O
were O
significantly O
more O
resistant O
than O
the O
CA O
strains. O
This O
observation O
indicates O
that O
clinicians O
should O
consider O
similar O
empirical O
therapy O
for O
patients O
with O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections. O
A O
recent O
study O
in O
Taiwan O
reported O
that O
the O
rate O
of O
resistance O
in O
the O
group O
of O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
bacteremia O
was O
between O
those O
groups O
of O
nosocomial O
and O
CA O
bacteremia O
[ O
28 O
]. O
This O
discrepancy O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
different O
infection O
types O
of O
the O
population O
studied, O
or O
the O
regional O
differences O
of O
resistance O
characteristics O
in O
K. O
pneumoniae. O

Subsequently, O
a O
polyphasic O
approach O
was O
introduced O
to O
classify O
prokaryotes O
based O
on O
integration O
of O
different O
kinds O
of O
phenotypic O
and O
genotypic O
data. O
It O
was O
followed O
by O
16S O
rRNA O
gene O
sequence O
analysis O
and O
DNA/DNA O
hybridization O
(DDH), O
which O
have O
become O
“the O
gold O
standard” O
in O
the O
taxonomy O
of O
bacteria O
(Rosselló-Mora O
and O
Amann O
2001 O
; O
Stackebrandt O
et O
al. O
2002 O
; O
Stackebrandt O
and O

). O
To O
accomplish O
the O
new O
species O
concept, O
the O
16S O
rDNA O
sequence O
similarity O
threshold O
97%, O
later O
changed O
into O
98.7%, O
was O
applied O
in O
recognizing O
new O
species O
of O
EPN O
symbionts O
(Farmer O

Additionally, O

introduced O

(Wayne O

and O
the O
80% O
DDH O

proposed O
by O
Vandamme O
et O
al. O
( O
1996 O
) O
effectively O
complemented O
the O
minimal O
standards O
in O
the O
taxonomy O
of O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus, O
respectively. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
rapid O
development O
of O
the O
gene O
sequencing O
techniques O
changed O
the O
approach O
to O
the O
definition O
of O
bacterial O
species. O
It O
became O
apparent O
that O
using O
solely O
ribosomal O
subunit O
sequences O
for O
taxonomic O
purposes O
was O
not O
suitable O
due O
to O
their O
low O
variation O
and O
lateral O
gene O
transfer O
(LTG) O
among O
different O
bacterial O
species O
(Akhurst O
et O

2006 O
; O
Lee O
and O
Stock O
2010a O
; O
Tailliez O
et O

2010 O
). O
To O
overcome O
this O
limitation, O
a O
more O
robust O
phylogenetic O
relationship O
framework O
for O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
was O
developed O
by O
comparing O
the O

Hence, O
optimizing O
mineral O
nutrition O
of O
medicinal O
plants O
during O
hydroponics, O
aeroponics O

pose O

For O

of O

but, O

was O
the O

However, O

can O
be O
encountered O
in O

For O

In O

the O
most O
employed O

the O

For O

[ O

Furthermore, O
AOM O

DSS-treated O
REGγ O

such O

In O
summary, O
our O
findings O
indicate O
that O
REGγ O
deficiency O
results O
in O
a O
less O
inflammatory O
micro-environment, O
attenuated O

and O
a O

, O

, O
we O
next O
tested O
the O
role O
of O
IκBɛ O
in O
inflammation-driven O
colon O
tumourigenesis. O
Following O
tumour O
induction O
in O
mice O
with O
different O
genotypes, O
we O
found O
that O
both O
WT O
mice O
and O
REG O
γ/IκBɛ O
double-KO O
mice O
had O
more O
colon O
tumours O
than O
REGγ O
−/− O
mice O
( O

Moreover, O
the O
REGγ/IκBɛ O
double-KO O
mice O
had O
comparative O
tumour O
sizes O
with O
that O
observed O
in O
WT O
mice, O
both O
having O
larger O
tumours O
than O
REGγ O
−/− O
mice O
( O
Supplementary O

Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
IκBɛ O
contributes O
to O
the O
protective O
role O
against O
colitis-associated O
tumourigenesis O
in O
REGγ O

mice O
by O
suppressing O
NFκB O
activity. O
To O
validate O
the O
specific O
regulation O
of O
IκBɛ O
by O
REGγ, O
we O
performed O
a O
‘rescue’ O
experiment O
in O
REGγ/IκBɛ O
double-KOt O
mice. O
Simultaneous O
deletion O
of O
REGγ O
and O
IκBɛ O
nearly O
abolished O
the O
protection O
in O
REGγ O
−/− O
mice O
for O
the O

of O
colitis, O
suggesting O
a O
key O
role O

function O
in O
our O

Evolutionary O
Psychology O
as O
an O
Exception? O
Since O
its O
inception, O
evolutionary O
psychology O
has O
stressed O
the O
importance O
of O
human O
universals O
(e.g. O
Buss O
1989 O
, O
1994 O
, O
1995 O
; O
Cosmides O
and O
Tooby O
1997 O
; O
Tooby O
and O
Cosmides O
1990 O
). O
Empirical O
examples O
where O
researchers O
have O
evaluated O
whether O
universals O
exist O
by O
testing O
across O
different O
populations O
include O
studies O
of O
homicide O
(Daly O
and O
Wilson O
1988 O
), O
economic O
behaviour O
(e.g. O
Henrich O
et O
al. O
2005 O
) O
and O
mate O
preferences O
(e.g. O
Buss O
et O
al. O
2000 O
; O
Buss O
1989 O
; O
Schmitt O
2005 O
; O
Shackelford O
et O
al. O
2005 O
). O
Cross-cultural O
universals O
(see O
for O
example O
those O
listed O
in O
Brown O
1991 O
, O
2000 O
) O
are O
often O
used O
by O
evolutionary O
psychologists O
as O
evidence O
for O
adaptive O
psychological O
mechanisms O
(e.g. O
Buss O
1995 O
). O
It O
would O
thus O
seem, O
as O
Apicella O
and O
Barrett O
( O
2016 O
: O
p. O
92) O
have O
argued, O
that O
‘perhaps O
no O
field O
of O
psychology O
is O
more O
strongly O
motivated O
and O
better O
equipped O
than O
evolutionary O
psychology O
to O
respond O
to O
the O
recent O
call O
for O
psychologists O
to O
expand O
their O
empirical O
base O
beyond O
WEIRD O
(Western O
Educated O
Industrialized O
Rich O
Democratic) O
samples’. O
Similarly, O
Kurzban O
( O
2013 O
) O
argued O
on O
the O
Evolutionary O
Psychology O
blog O
that O
‘adding O
evolution O
to O
psychology O
makes O
the O
science O
less O
WEIRD’. O
He O
found O
that O
for O
the O
2012 O
volume, O
65% O
of O
the O
articles O
in O
the O
journal O
‘Evolution O
&amp; O
Human O
Behavior’ O
were O
WEIRD, O
which O
contrasts O
favourably O
with O
data O
for O
other O
fields O
as O
cited O
above. O
This O
initial O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
evolutionary O
psychology O
is O
indeed O
less O
WEIRD O
than O
some O
subdivisions O
of O
psychology. O
Here, O
we O
examine O
the O

used O
in O
two O
leading O
evolutionary O

in O
more O

We O
have O
no O
explicit O

but O
rather O
describe O
the O

in O
these O
two O

to O
their O
geographical O
origin, O

However, O
the O
mechanisms O
and O
roles O
of O
NFκB O
signalling O
in O
intestinal O
immunity O
remain O
less O
clear. O
Several O
studies O
suggest O
that O
NFκB O
activation O
may O
have O
an O
essential O
protective O
role O
against O
intestinal O
inflammation. O
For O
example, O
mice O
lacking O
NEMO O
in O
IEC O
(NEMO O
IEC-KO O
) O
displayed O
a O
spontaneous O
development O
of O
colon O
inflammation O
47 O
. O
Furthermore, O
mice O
with O
IEC-specific O
ablation O
of O
IKK2 O
developed O
more O
severe O
DSS-induced O
colitis O
38 O
and O
had O
excessive O
production O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
Th1 O
cytokine O
with O
parasite O
infection O
48 O
. O
These O
observations O
suggest O
that O
NFκB O
activation O
in O
epithelial O
cells O
is O
necessary O
for O
preserving O
intestinal O
immune O
homoeostasis, O
while O
other O
reports O
indicate O
constitutive O
NFκB O
activation O
may O
induce O
inflammation O
and O
tissue O
damage O
49 O
, O
50 O
. O
An O
important O
question O
is O
how O
to O
reconcile O
these O
seemingly O
contradictory O
observations. O
Perhaps O
maintaining O
NFκB O
activity O
within O
a O
normal O
range O
is O
crucial O
for O
natural O
defense O
against O
intestinal O
inflammation. O
Either O
too O
much O
or O
too O
little O
NFκB O
activation O
might O
be O
detrimental O
to O
the O
intestinal O
homoeostasis. O
Consistent O
with O
these O
notions, O
reciprocal O
positive-feedback O
regulation O
between O
REGγ O
and O
NFκB O
in O
IEC O
harbours O
the O
risk O
for O
run-away O
NFκB O
overactivation O
and O
development O
of O
bowel O
inflammation O
and O
CAC O
in O
DSS O
models. O
By O
analysing O
the O
correlation O
between O
REGγ O
and O
IBD O
in O
published O
database O
(ID:GSE10616), O
we O
found O
no O
significant O
changes O
in O
REGγ O
expression O
between O
CD O
and O
normal O
controls. O
However, O
the O
UC O
group O
had O
elevated O
REGγ O
expression, O
suggesting O
that O
CD O
and O
UC O
are O
two O
different O
forms O
of O
IBD. O
The O
UPS O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
activation O
of O
the O
NFκB O
pathway. O
Ubiquitin-dependent O
degradation O
of O
IκBs O
is O
central O
to O
activating O
NFκB. O
However, O
we O
now O
further O
reveal O
that O
IκBɛ O
is O
subject O
to O
REGγ-proteasome-dependent O
degradation, O
which O
thereby O
neutralizes O
these O
protective O
effects O
in O
WT O
mice. O

For O
these O
sorts O
of O
reasons, O
classic O
studies O
that O
seek O
to O
test O
adaptive O
reasoning O
have O
taken O
pains O
to O
survey O
different O
populations O
(e.g. O

(Henrich O

As O
an O
additional O
step, O
WEIRD O

(including O
ourselves) O
could O
usefully O
reach O
out O

Henrich O

( O

that O

can O
be O
more O
or O
less O

upon O
the O

and O
goes O
on O

where O

To O

Henrich O

that O

Similarly, O
folkbiological O

differently O
in O
rural O
American O

with O

Further, O

between O
the O
original O

collected O
from O

later O
among O

In O

that O
assumed O

the O

the O

some O

Changes O
in O
the O
taxonomy O
of O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
- O
historical O
overview O
Symbiotic O
bacteria O
isolated O
from O
the O
nematode O
Steinernema O
carpocapse O
were O
described O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
1965 O
(Poinar O
and O
Thomas O
1965 O
; O
Poinar O
and O
Thomas O
1966 O
). O
They O
were O
named O
Achromobacter O
nematophilus, O
later O
transferred O
to O
a O
newly O
created O
genus O
Xenorhbdus O
and O
renamed O
as O
Xenorhabdus O
nematophilus, O
and O
finally O
renamed O
as O
Xenorhabdus O
nematophila O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
bacteriological O
nomenclature O
(Thomas O
and O
Poinar O
1979 O
; O
Euzéby O
and O
Boemare O
2000 O
). O
Meanwhile, O
symbiotic O
glowing O
bacteria O
isolated O
from O
Heterorhabditis O
bacteriophora O
were O
included O
into O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus O
as O
Xenorhabdus O
luminescensens O
(Thomas O
and O
Poinar O
1979 O
). O
Therefore, O
up O
to O
1993, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
bacterial O
species O
in O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus, O
i.e. O
Xenorhabdus O
nematophila O
(type O
species) O
and O
Xenorhabdus O
luminesces, O
which O
comprised O
symbionts O
of O
Steinernema O
and O
Heterorhabditis O
nematodes, O
respectively O
(Akhurst O
1983 O
; O
Akhurst O
and O
Boemare O
1988 O
; O
Boemare O
and O
Akhurst O
1988 O
; O
Farmer O
et O
al. O
1989 O
). O
However, O
the O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
phenotypic O
and O
molecular O
traits O
between O
these O
two O
species O
resulted O
in O
the O
transfer O
of O
all O
Heterorhabditis O
nematode O
symbionts O
into O
a O
new O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
as O
Photorhabus O
luminescens O
(Boemare O
et O
al. O
1993 O
). O
Although O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus O
was O
found O
to O
be O
more O
homogenous O
than O
Photorhabdus, O
it O
quickly O
became O
relatively O
rich O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
number O
of O
species O
(Akhurst O
et O
al. O
1996 O
). O
At O
first, O
using O
a O
polyphasic O
approach, O
3 O
new O
species O
were O
described O
by O
elevating O
the O
X. O
nematophila O
subspecies O
to O
the O
species O
level, O
i.e. O

We O
found O
that O
Acc16485.1 O
(alpha-glucan O
phosphorylase) O
and O
Acc03527.1 O
(AGAMOUS-like) O
were O
significantly O
upregulated O
in O
P1 O
at O
0 O
and O
24 O
h O
post-infection O
compared O
with O
‘Hort16A’ O
suggesting O
that O
their O
expression O
is O
naturally O
higher O
in O
the O
resistant O
parent O
or O
suppressed O
in O
the O
susceptible O
parent O
and O
is O
not O
induced O
by O
pathogen O
infection O
(Supplementary O

The O
remaining O
candidate O
genes O
were O
not O
differentially O
expressed O
between O
the O
two O
parents O
at O
either O
time O
point, O

for O

(Ammonium O

Recipes O
form O
part O
of O
the O
cultural O
patrimony O
and O
the O
traditional O
knowledge O
transmitted O
orally O
through O
cultural O
practices O
that O
have O
endured O
for O
many O
decades O
(Sánchez-Martínez O
2006 O
). O
The O
mushroom O
recipes O
we O
encountered O
had O
been O
inherited O
and O
passed O
down O
for O
more O
than O
three O
generations O
by O
both O
women O
and O
men. O
In O
general, O
only O
one O
species O
was O
used O
per O
dish, O
and O
the O
modes O
of O
preparation O
were O
quite O
simple. O
They O
used O
elements O
within O
their O
reach, O
including O
different O
inexpensive O
ingredients O
typical O
of O
Mexican O
food O
such O
as O
tomatoes, O
onions, O
and O
chillis. O
The O
most O
elaborate O
dish O
was O
mushrooms O
with O
mole O
(a O
sauce O
prepared O
with O
many O
kinds O
of O
chillis) O
seasoned O
with O
wild O
plants O
such O
as O
jocoyole O
(Oxalis O
corniculata). O
However, O
simple O
recipes O
were O
preferred O
in O
which O
the O
flavour O
of O
the O
mushrooms O
stood O
out, O
so O
they O
were O
commonly O
prepared O
only O
with O
salt O
without O
any O
other O
seasoning O
or O
ingredient. O
The O
Wixaritari O
consumed O
Ustilago O
maydis O
as O
a O
food O
or O
as O
ceremonial O
drink, O
commonly O
called O
tsinari. O
According O
to O
Torres O
( O
2000 O
), O
tsinari O
is O
a O
drink O
(atole) O
made O
from O
the O
flour O
of O
white O
maize O
that O
is O
consumed O
for O
breakfast O
and, O
following O
Kindl O
( O
2003 O
), O
it O
is O
a O
bitter O
atole O
for O
ritual O
use. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
tsinari O
was O
found O
to O
be O
a O
maize O
drink O
containing O
U. O
maydis, O
known O
among O
the O
interviewees O
as O
atole O
negro O
(black O
atole), O
similar O
to O
the O
report O
of O
Villaseñor-Ibarra O
et O
al. O
( O
2018 O
; O
as O
“chinari”). O
It O
was O
made O
from O
flour O
of O
nixtamalized O
maize O
—that O
goes O
through O
a O
chemical O
process O
in O
alkali O
solutions O
that O
increases O
its O
nutritional O
value— O
cooked O
with O
water O
in O
a O
clay O
pot O
over O
a O
fire O
until O
the O
mixture O
boiled O
and O
thickened. O

Some O
efficacy O
was O
also O
observed O
with O
NNV003, O
probably O
due O
to O
an O
immunotherapeutic O
effect O
of O
the O
antibody. O
In O
another O
i.v. O
model O
using O
DOHH-2 O
cells, O
the O
anti-tumour O
effect O
of O
NNV003 O
was O
equal O
to O
the O
effect O
of O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
(Online O
Resource, O
Fig. O
S3b O
). O
However, O
in O
a O
s.c. O
model O
mimicking O
a O
bulkier O
disease, O
there O
was O
no O
effect O
of O
NNV003 O
alone, O
even O
at O
a O
clinically O
relevant O
dose O
of O
10 O
mg/kg. O
In O
this O
model, O
the O
immunotherapeutic O
effect O
was O
not O
potent O
enough, O
while O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
delayed O
tumour O
growth O
and O
prolonged O
survival O
significantly. O
All O
animal O
models O
utilized O
mouse O
strains O
with O
functional O
NK-cells O
and O
macrophages, O
capable O
of O
ADCC O
and O
ADCP O
activity O
[ O
31 O
, O
32 O
]. O
We O
observed O
a O
modest O
and O
temporary O
reduction O
in O
white O
blood O
cell O
counts O
after O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
treatment. O
Additionally, O
while O
some O
biochemical O
indication O
of O
hepatotoxicity O
was O
seen, O
no O
abnormal O
findings O
of O
the O
liver O
were O
observed O
by O
histopathological O
examination O
of O
organs. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
treatment O
related O
changes O
were O
mainly O
seen O
in O
the O
ovaries, O
consistent O
with O
pre-clinical O
studies O
with O
177 O
Lu-lilotomab O
satetraxetan O
[ O
33 O
]. O
No O
treatment O
related O
changes O
were O
identified O
in O
the O
bone O
marrow, O
possibly O
attributed O
to O
bone O
marrow O
regeneration O
due O
to O
the O
long O
study O
duration. O
In O
a O
phase O
1/2a O
clinical O
trial O
of O
177 O
Lu-lilotomab O
satetraxetan O
for O
treatment O
of O
patients O
with O
relapsed O
indolent O
NHL, O
reversible O
thrombocytopenia O
and O
neutropenia O
were O
the O
most O
common O
adverse O
events O
observed O
[ O
21 O
]. O
The O
favourable O
efficacy O
and O
toxicity O
profile O
of O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
suggests O
a O
beneficial O
therapeutic O
window. O
Moreover, O
this O
compound O
binds O
to O
a O
different O
antigen O
than O
CD20, O
which O
is O
the O
most O
common O
target O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
B O
cell O
malignancies. O
Accordingly, O
most O
NHL O
patients O
with O
recurrent O
disease O
will O
become O
refractory O
to O
treatments O
targeting O
CD20 O
[ O
12 O
]. O

that O

Our O

related O
to O
the O

the O

This O
begs O
the O

as O
to O
whether O
CLO/PXG O

We O

Some O

[ O

Finally, O
if O

In O
all O

Conclusion O
– O
the O
future O
for O
the O
microbiome O
and O
immunotherapy O
Given O
the O
intricacy O
of O
the O
microbiome, O
it O
will O
be O
challenging O
to O
tease O
out O
the O
essential O
mechanistic O
elements O
in O
such O
a O
complex O
system. O
Even O
if O
two O
individuals O
harbor O
the O
same O
species O
of O
bacteria, O
there O
can O
be O
variation O
of O
each O
bacterium O
at O
the O
strain O
level, O
which O
could O
yield O
divergent O
functions O
upon O
interaction O
with O
the O
host. O
Moreover, O
two O
identical O
strains O
in O
two O
disparate O
communities O
may O
contribute O
differently O
to O
their O
collective O
consortium O
and O
thus O
function O
differently O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
host. O
As O
such, O
tremendous O
care O
will O
need O
to O
be O
taken O
when O
assigning O
specific O
functional O
attributes O
to O
given O
commensal O
bacteria. O
Furthermore, O
a O
large O
majority O
of O
focus O
on O
cancer O
immunotherapy O
and O
the O
microbiome O
has O
investigated O
the O
contribution O
of O
bacteria O
but O
has O
yet O
to O
thoroughly O
investigate O
non-bacterial O
components O
including O
viruses, O
fungi O
and O
protozoa. O
Evidence O
in O
non-cancer O
disease O
models O
has O
indicated O
that O
the O
mycobiome O
(fungi) O
and O
the O
virome O
(viruses) O
can O
regulate O
systemic O
immunity. O
For O
example, O
manipulation O
of O
the O
mycobiome O
by O
oral O
antifungal O
drugs O
increased O
the O
severity O
of O

And O
that O
indicated O
that O
mutation O
from O
the O
wild O
type O
to O
H531C O
required O
a O
step-by-step O
process. O
In O
addition, O
as O
environmental O
conditions O
could O
affect O
protein O
stability O
and O
activity, O
rpoB O
mutations O
might O
affect O
the O
function O
of O
RNAP O
at O
different O
temperatures O
[ O
27 O
, O
28 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
selected O
rpoB O
mutations O
were O
specific O
under O
certain O
environmental O
pressures O
[ O
29 O
, O
30 O
], O
which O
also O
provided O
an O
explanation O
for O
the O
differences O
in O
detected O
rpoB O
mutations. O
Above O
all, O
the O
spontaneous O
mutation O
test O
in O
this O
study O
was O
carried O
out O
on O
solid O
medium O
without O
antibiotics O
at O
37 O
°C O
lacking O
clinically O
specific O
environmental O
pressures, O
making O
all O
mutations O
possible O
to O
survive, O
which O
had O
little O
to O
do O
with O
their O
respective O
fitness. O
Studies O
in O
F. O
psychrophilum O
suggested O
that O
strains O
under O
the O
rifampin O
pressure O
were O
prone O
to O
enrich O
more O
single-nucleotide O
polymorphism, O
which O
would O
be O
associated O
with O
weakened O

[ O

]. O
Therefore, O
the O
types O
of O
rpoB O
mutations O
obtained O
from O
spontaneous O
mutation O
tests O
were O
various, O
while O
the O
types O
identified O
in O

were O
relatively O
concentrated. O
Due O
to O
the O
frequency O
of O

mutation O
sites O
(the O
sum O
of O
different O

and O
the O
distribution, O
the O
frequency O
of O

in O

was O
as O
high O
as O
98.8%. O
These O

The O

was O
only O
0.4%. O
The O
type O
of O

S539F, O
and O
no O

was O
detected O

It O
was O

that O

the O

In O

Recently, O

By O

S. O

The O

increase O

[ O

Although O
most O

have O
been O
well O
studied, O
the O
function O

a O
few O
TCSs O

AirSR O

the O

Subsequently, O
AirSR O

as O
an O

that O

Moreover, O

These O

a O

during O

Therefore, O
in O
the O

of O

our O

that O

but O
may O
also O
provide O
a O
more O

This O
statement O
is O

The O
data O

show O
that O
oxylipins O
decrease O
the O
aflatoxicogenicity O
of O

in O

probably O
via O
the O
down-regulation O

AfPXG. O
As O

treatment O
of O

with O
oxylipins O
extracted O

While O
the O

as O

the O

sporulated O
less O
actively O
under O
such O

This O
was O
found O
in O
all O
of O

In O

the O

was O
reduced O
by O

In O

Because O
they O
are O
relatively O
low-cost, O
low-input, O
and O
low-risk O
compared O
with O
other O
organic O
crops, O
small O
grains O
can O
be O
extremely O
beneficial O
to O
growers O
(Wiersma O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Small O
grains O
help O
to O
promote O
soil O
aggregation O
more O
than O
many O
cash O
crops, O
which O
contributes O
to O
the O
overall O
soil O
health O
of O
the O
system O
(Drinkwater O
1999 O
). O
In O
regions O
where O
grains O
can O
successfully O
overwinter, O
fall-planted O
grains O
can O
fit O
into O
production O
windows O
not O
available O
to O
other O
crops. O
Additionally, O
winter O
small O
grains O
can O
help O
suppress O
weeds O
in O
subsequent O
crops O
(Teasdale O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Anderson O

Baker O

). O
Disease O
and O
insect O
pests O
can O
be O
managed O
effectively O
by O
choosing O
resistant O
varieties O
and O
using O
cultural O
control O
methods O
(Wiersma O

Barley O
(Hordeum O
vulgare O
L.) O
offers O
many O
benefits O
for O
organic O
farming O
systems. O
In O
regions O
where O
it O
is O
suitable O
as O
a O
winter O
grain, O
barley O
establishes O
rapidly O
in O
the O
fall O
and O
can O
out-compete O
annual O
winter O
weeds. O
Because O
of O
its O
quick O
canopy O
growth O
after O
seeding, O
barley O
can O
be O
quite O
competitive O
against O
weeds. O
Many O
diseases O
and O
insects O
that O
affect O
barley O
are O
regionally O
specific, O
but O
this O
pressure O
can O
generally O
be O
managed O
effectively O
using O
integrated O
pest O
management O
strategies. O
However, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
most O
currently O
available O
varieties O
have O
been O
selected O
for O
conventional O
growing O
conditions O
and O
many O
may O
not O
always O
be O
the O
best O
suited O
for O
organic O
farming O
conditions; O
breeding O
new O
varieties O
under O
organic O
conditions O
can O
help O
remedy O
this. O
Barley O
offers O
some O
advantages O
over O
other O
small O
grains: O
it O
requires O
less O
nitrogen O
than O
wheat O
and O
matures O
more O
quickly O
than O
other O
small O
grains, O
which O
allows O
subsequent O
crops O
to O
be O
planted O
earlier O
(Wiersma O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Because O
it O
can O
be O
malted O
for O
brewing O
and O
distilling, O
eaten O
as O
a O
food O
grain, O
and O
fed O
to O
livestock, O
barley O
provides O
diverse O
marketing O
options. O
It O
can O
also O
be O
intercropped O
with O
legumes, O
which O
gives O
producers O
the O
option O
to O
till O
it O
in O
as O
a O
green O
manure O
cover O
crop, O
harvest O
before O
maturity O
as O
a O
green O
chop O
fed O
to O
livestock, O
or O
grow O
to O
maturity O
to O
market O
as O
a O
mixed O
feed O
grain, O
depending O
on O
soil O
needs O
and O
market O
conditions. O

Importantly, O
we O
show O
more O
efficient O
replication O
of O
ECTV O
in O
JAWS O
II O
and O
GM-BM O
cells O
with O
the O
minimal O
level O
of O
cathepsin O
B, O
L O
or O
S. O
These O
results O
show O
that O
ECTV O
may O
impair O
the O
function O

Fig. O

that O

However, O
at O

the O

higher O
in O
ECTV-infected O

In O
our O

we O
reported O
that O
GM-BM O

ECTV O
at O

did O

therefore, O
in O
the O

study O
(GM-BM O

we O
evaluated O
the O
apoptotic O

only O
at O
24 O

(Fig. O

The O

not O
significantly O
(p O

increased O
in O
GM-BM O

Taken O
together, O
our O

that O

The O

combined O
with O
mutations O
in O

the O

can O
be O
associated O

[ O

, O
34 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
overexpression O
of O
efflux O

in O

may O
also O
lead O
to O
carbapenem O
resistance. O
However, O
both O
porin O
Ompk35 O
and O

were O
present O
in O
the O
other O
four O
CRKP O
strains O
with O
ESBL-positive O
in O
this O
study O
(data O
not O

Further O
studies O
should O
be O
conducted O
to O
assess O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
mutations O
in O
strains O
isolated O
in O
the O
current O
investigation. O
This O
study O
showed O
that O
the O
ESBL-producing O
strains O
were O
prevalent O
both O
in O
medical O
and O
community O
settings. O
Previous O
studies O
by O
Zhang O
et O
al. O
[ O
35 O
] O
and O
Quan O
et O
al. O
[ O
36 O
] O
also O
reported O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
ESBL-positive O
strains O
in O
community-onset O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
ESBL O
producers O
have O
disseminated O
to O
the O
community, O
which O
poses O
a O
challenge O
to O
resistance O
control. O
Bla O
CTX-M O
was O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
ESBL O
gene O
among O
ESBL O
producers O
in O
our O
study. O
This O
is O
accordance O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
CTX-M O
is O
the O
most O
common O
ESBL O
genotype O
in O
China O
[ O
36 O
]. O
No O
significant O
differences O
were O
observed O
in O
the O
distribution O
of O
bla O
CTX-M O
, O
bla O
SHV O
and O
bla O
TEM O
genes O
among O
isolates O
from O
the O
three O
groups, O
suggesting O
the O
wide O
dissemination O
of O
these O
genes O
possibly O
via O
horizontal O
transfer O
in O
different O
populations. O
Interestingly, O
the O
CTX-M-1 O
variant O
was O
more O
frequently O
detected O
among O
CA O
strains O
than O
among O
nosocomial O
strains, O
whereas O
the O
CTX-M-9 O
variant O
was O
more O
common O
in O
nosocomial O
strains O
than O
in O
CA O
strains. O
This O
suggests O
that O
nosocomial O
and O
CA O
ESBL-producing O
strains O
may O
carry O
different O
plasmids, O
which O
carried O
the O
different O
subtype O
of O
CTX-M O
genes. O
Overall, O
the O
PFGE O
typing O
showed O
a O
high O
clonal O
diversity O
among O
the O
ESBL-producing O
and O
CRKP O
strains O
isolated O
from O
the O
three O
different O
groups, O
indicating O
the O
variety O
of O

sources O
acquired O
by O
the O
three O
populations. O

According O
to O
Balin O
et O
al O
and O
other O
studies, O
amyloid O
proteins O
play O
a O
part O
in O
the O
disease, O
but O
only O
in O
response O
to O
the O
initial O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
the O
microbial O
infection, O
that O
is O
attacking O
the O
brain O
(Balin O
and O
Hudson, O
2014 O
). O
Recent O
study O
showed O
that O
Aβ O
may O
play O
a O
protective O
role O
in O
innate O
immunity O
and O
infectious O
or O
sterile O
inflammatory O
stimuli O
may O
drive O
amyloidosis O
and O
that O
Aβ O
oligomerization, O
a O
behavior O
traditionally O
viewed O
as O
intrinsically O
pathological, O
may O
be O
necessary O
for O
the O
antimicrobial O
activities O
of O
the O
peptide, O
which O
mean O
that O
Aβ O
serves O
to O
protect O
the O
brain O
from O
invading O
microbes O
(Kumar O
et O
al., O
2016 O
). O
In O

study O
of O
Chlamydia O
pneumoniae O
showed O
that O
the O
infection O
of O
monocytes O
could O
stimulate O
innate O
and O
adaptive O
immune O
responses O
relevant O
to O
those O
in O
AD O
(Balin O

Hudson, O
2014 O
; O
Lim O
et O
al., O
2014 O
; O
Little O
et O

). O
Hoban O
et O

elucidated O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
microbial O
influence O
by O
investigating O
changes O
in O
the O
homeostatic O
regulation O
of O
neuronal O
transcription O
of O
germ-free O
mice O
within O
the O
prefrontal O
cortex, O
and O
showed O
that O
the O
microbiome O
is O
necessary O
for O
appropriate O
and O
dynamic O
regulation O
of O
myelin-related O
genes O
(the O
formation O
of O
fatty O
sheathing O
that O
insulates O
nerve O
fibres), O
with O
clear O
implications O
for O
cortical O
myelination O
at O
an O
ultrastructural O
level O
(Hoban O
et O
al., O
2016 O
). O
Experiments O
by O
Lee O
et O
al O
also O
showed O
that O
the O
germ-free O
mice O
were O
protected O
from O
causing O
the O
case O
experimentally, O
similar O
to O
multiple O
sclerosis, O
characterized O
by O
the O
demise O
of O
myelin, O
which O
encases O
nerve O
fibers O
(Lee O
et O
al., O
2011 O
). O
There O
is O
also O
the O
possibility O
that O
these O
hypothetical O
pathways O
are O
tangled O
and O
that O
e.g. O
Aβ O
deposits O
in O
the O
cerebrovascular O
wall O
will O
elicit O
a O
peripheral O
inflammatory O
response O
that O
will O
in O

enhance O

Discussion O
Our O
study O
shows O
a O
direct O
connection O
between O
cell O
wall O
metabolism O
and O
AirSR. O
More O
than O
20 O
genes O
that O
are O
related O
to O
cell O
wall O
metabolism O
were O
down-regulated O
in O
the O
airSR O
mutant, O
as O
shown O
by O
microarray O
analysis. O
Real-time O
RT O
PCR O
experiments O
confirmed O
the O
transcript O
level O
changes O
of O
several O
genes O
(cap5B, O
cap5D, O
tagA, O
SAOUHSC_00953, O
pbp1, O
murD, O
ftsQ, O
and O
ddl). O
Real-time O
RT O
PCR O
indicated O
that O
the O
transcription O
of O
a O
major O
autolysin, O
LytM, O
was O
down-regulated O
in O
the O
airSR O
mutant. O
This O
result O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
observation O
of O
a O
decreased O
autolysis O
rates O
induced O
by O
Triton O
X-100 O
in O
the O
airSR O
mutant. O
The O
gel-shift O
assays O
indicated O
that O
AirR O
can O
directly O
bind O
to O
the O
promoter O
regions O
of O
cap, O
ddl, O
pbp1, O
and O
lytM. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
AirSR O
enhances O
cell O
wall O
synthesis O
and O
degradation. O
We O
performed O
the O
phylogenetic O
footprinting O

According O
to O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
primary O
peritonitis O
caused O
by O
streptococcus, O
16% O
of O
patients O
developed O
streptococcal O
toxic O
shock O
syndrome O
(STSS) O
from O
an O
ascending O
infection O
originating O
from O
the O
vagina, O
9% O
of O
patients O
developed O
it O
from O
a O
droplet O
infection, O
6% O
of O
patients O
developed O
it O
from O
pharyngitis, O
and O
69% O
of O
patients O
developed O
it O
via O
an O
unknown O
route O
[ O
9 O
]. O
In O
our O
case, O
we O
could O
not O
determine O
the O
primary O
site O
of O
infection; O
we O
should O
have O
collected O
a O
vaginal O
culture O
to O
confirm O
whether O
the O
infection O
originated O
in O
the O
vaginal O
tract. O
For O
the O
same O
reason, O
we O
should O
have O
collected O
a O
pharynx O
culture. O
The O
diagnosis O
of O
peritonitis O
was O
based O
on O
the O
presence O
of O
purulent O
ascites O
cultures O
with O
increased O
lactate O

(LDH) O
and O

Necrotizing O
fasciitis O
is O
an O
infection O
of O
the O
deeper O
subcutaneous O
tissue O
and O
fascia O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
rapidly O
spreading O
necrosis O
of O
the O
skin. O
The O
successful O
management O
of O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
is O
dependent O
on O
early O
recognition, O
but O
classical O
signs O
of O
a O
necrotizing O
process O
are O
not O
initially O
apparent. O
If O
the O
patients O
have O
a O
defined O
portal O
of O
entry, O
such O
as O
a O
surgical O
incision, O
burn, O
insect O
bite, O
or O
varicella O
lesion, O
the O
skin O
around O
will O
be O
red O
with O
severe O
pain O
and O
swelling. O
However, O
in O
the O
50% O
of O
patients O
who O
develop O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
without O
a O
defined O
portal O
of O
entry, O
the O
infection O
begins O
deep O
in O
the O
tissues, O
frequently O
at O
the O
site O
of O
a O
hematoma, O
muscle O
strain, O
or O
traumatic O

are O

of O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
associated O
with O

[ O

One O
study O
found O
that O
54% O

Barley O
offers O
some O
advantages O
over O
other O
small O
grains: O
it O
requires O
less O
nitrogen O
than O
wheat O
and O
matures O
more O
quickly O
than O
other O
small O
grains, O
which O
allows O
subsequent O
crops O
to O
be O
planted O
earlier O
(Wiersma O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Because O
it O
can O
be O
malted O
for O
brewing O
and O
distilling, O
eaten O
as O
a O
food O
grain, O
and O
fed O
to O
livestock, O
barley O
provides O
diverse O
marketing O
options. O
It O
can O
also O
be O
intercropped O
with O
legumes, O
which O
gives O
producers O
the O
option O
to O
till O
it O
in O
as O
a O
green O
manure O
cover O
crop, O
harvest O
before O
maturity O
as O
a O
green O
chop O
fed O
to O
livestock, O
or O
grow O
to O
maturity O
to O
market O
as O
a O
mixed O
feed O
grain, O
depending O
on O
soil O
needs O
and O
market O
conditions. O
Despite O
its O
benefits, O
many O
organic O
farmers O
have O
been O
reluctant O
to O
plant O
barley. O
New O
varieties O
bred O
for O
organic O
systems O
that O
meet O
quality O
standards O
to O
be O
sold O
into O
multiple O
markets O
may O
encourage O
farmers O
to O
add O
barley O
to O
their O
rotation. O
In O
principle, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
breed O
a O
naked O
barley O
suitable O
for O
feed, O
food, O
and O
malting O
that O
will O
perform O
well O
in O
organic O
systems O
(Meints O
and O

In O

the O

and O
to O
understand O
what O
qualities, O

to O
detect O
one O
or O
more O
of O
these O
motifs O
but O
manual O
inspection O
revealed O
that O
this O
was O
due O
to O
small O
changes O
in O
a O
few O
amino O
acids O
that O
resulted O
in O
a O
lack O
of O
recognition O
of O
the O
motif O
by O
MEME O
although O
its O
major O
features O
were O
in O
fact O
present O
and O
intact. O
For O
example, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
basal O
species, O
Rozella O
allomyces, O
three O
of O
the O
five O
major O
CLO/PXG O
motifs O
appear O
to O
be O
missing O
according O
to O
MEME O
(final O
line O
in O
Fig. O

), O
but O
manual O
inspection O
shows O
that O
the O
‘missing’ O
motifs O
2, O
4 O
and O
5 O
are O
essentially O
present, O
albeit O
in O
somewhat O
modified O
form O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
fungal O
sequences. O
Despite O
extensive O
trials, O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
find O
any O
better O
motif O
prediction O
software O
than O
MEME O
for O
this O
particular O
analysis O
but O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
even O
MEME O
is O
not O
always O
fully O
reliable. O
Nevertheless, O
the O
method O
is O
still O
useful O
for O
a O
broad-brush O
analysis O
of O
large O
numbers O
of O
sequences, O
with O
the O
proviso O
that O
manual O
curation O
is O
still O
required O
for O
more O
accurate O
results. O
One O
example O
of O
a O
useful O
prediction O
from O
MEME O
was O
the O
discovery O
of O

The O

no O

It O
was O
worth O
noting O
that O
two O

had O
been O
detected. O
One O
was O
the O
insertion O
of O
a O

at O
the O

the O
other O
was O
the O

the O
amino O

Their O
biological O
characteristics O
were O
mainly O
manifested O
in O
the O
impairment O

The O

by O
gene O
mutations O

often O
accompanied O
by O

In O
the O
absence O

From O
this O

there O
was O
no O

the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
fitness O

of O
the O
mutation O
and O
the O
level O
of O

Except O
for O
H491D O
and O
485::TAA, O
most O
of O
the O
mutants O
had O
no O
obvious O
damage O
to O
growth O
performance O
in O

Studies O
in O
Neisseria O
meningitidis O
indicated O
that O
the O
growth O
of O
mutation O
S487F O
at O
37 O
°C O
was O
significantly O
inhibited O
and O
had O
a O
high O
fitness O
cost O
[ O
12 O
], O
but O
the O
same O
mutation O
in O
R. O
anatipestifer O
was O
more O
normal. O
As O
with O
the O
study O
in O
M. O
tuberculosis, O
the O
fitness O
costs O
of O
different O
rpoB O
mutations O
were O
different, O
and O
the O
relative O
fitness O
of O
the O
H491D O
mutant O
was O
always O
the O
lowest O
of O
all O
mutation O
types O
at O
this O
site O
(equivalent O
to O
H526D O
in O
this O
study) O
[ O
32 O
]. O
However, O
colonization O
experiments O
in O
ducklings O
showed O
that O
whether O
R494K, O
whose O
in O

growth O
and O
competitive O
ability O
were O
similar O
to O
the O
parental O
strain, O
or O
H491D, O
whose O
growth O
and O
competition O
abilities O
decreased, O
both O
of O
their O

abilities O
were O
deduced O
in O

This O
suggests O
that O
all O
of O
the O

in O
the O

in O
the O

In O
fact, O
the O

which O
again O
suggested O
that O

CYP125A1 O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
Mtb O
growth O
in O

Its O
downregulation O
under O

is O
consistent O
with O
the O
capability O
of O
the O
bacteria O
to O
distinguish O
different O
stresses, O
triggering O
specific O
transcriptomic O
responses O
(Griffin O
et O
al. O
2011 O
). O
The O
transcriptional O

was O
opposite O
to O
the O

presented O
in O
Fig. O

for O
the O

cyp141a1 O
were O

whereas O
cyp125a1 O
and O
FdxE O
were O
clearly O

This O

In O

it O
could O
be O
the O

decreased O
protein O
synthesis O
due O
to O
downregulation O

(Koul O

Due O

In O
particular, O
CYP121A1 O
and O
CYP125A1/CYP142A1 O
are O
considered O
promising O
drug-targets, O
because O
several O

and O

bind O

This O
suggests O
that O
nosocomial O
and O
CA O
ESBL-producing O
strains O
may O
carry O
different O
plasmids, O
which O
carried O
the O
different O
subtype O
of O
CTX-M O
genes. O
Overall, O
the O

showed O
a O
high O
clonal O
diversity O
among O
the O
ESBL-producing O
and O
CRKP O
strains O
isolated O
from O
the O
three O
different O
groups, O
indicating O
the O
variety O
of O

sources O
acquired O
by O
the O
three O
populations. O
Of O
note, O
the O
clonal O
dissemination O
of O
ESBL-producing O
strains O
has O
occurred O
in O
the O
hospital O
as O
indicated O
by O
the O
three O
identical O
profiles O
observed O
in O
cluster O
C13. O
Further O
study O
is O
needed O
to O
investigate O
the O
origin O
and O
the O
route O
of O
the O
transmission. O
In O
cluster O
C82-II O
and O
cluster O
C82-III, O
the O
HCA O
strains O
and O
nosocomial O
strains O
showed O
the O
same O
PFGE O
profiles, O
suggesting O
the O
cross O
transmission O
of O
CRKP O
among O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
patients. O
CRKP O
strains O
could O
be O
introduced O
into O
the O
hospital, O
then O
spread O
within O
the O
institution O
and O
might O
cause O
nosocomial O
infections O
during O
the O
entry O
of O
HCA O
patients O
with O
CRKP O
infections, O
of O
which O
we O
should O
keep O
alert. O
Identical O
profiles O
among O
HCA O
CRKP O
isolates O
implies O
the O
clonal O
spread O
of O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
among O
HCA O
patients. O
It O
suggests O
the O
healthcare-associated O
transmission O
of O
CRKP O
strains O
in O
the O
local O
area. O
In O
addition, O
the O
same O
PFGE O
profiles O
were O
observed O
in O
strains O
carrying O
different O
resistance O
gene O
profiles, O
suggesting O
later O
acquisition O
of O
the O
resistance O
genes O
via O
horizontal O
transfer O
under O
antibiotic O
selection O
pressure. O
The O
main O
finding O
in O
the O
present O
study O
was O
that O
the O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
of O
HCA O
isolates O
was O
similar O
in O
severity O
to O
nosocomial O
isolates. O
This O
study O
was O
conducted O
at O
a O
tertiary O
hospital O
in O
Guangzhou O
city, O
Guangdong O
province, O
where O
more O
severe O
patients O
from O
all O
over O
the O
province O
or O
neighboring O
provinces O
had O
been O
hospitalized O
and O
approximately O
20% O
had O
been O
referred O
from O
other O
hospitals, O
which O
could O
explain O
the O
serious O
drug O
resistance O
in O
the O
HCA O
group O
in O
our O
study. O
Given O
distinct O
features O
of O
K. O
pneumoniae O
strains O
from O
different O
regions, O
more O
epidemiological O
data O
on O
nosocomial, O
HCA, O
and O
CA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections O
are O
needed O
to O
better O
manage O
patients. O

Similar O
to O
cathepsin O
B, O
down-regulation O
of O
cathepsin O
L O
also O
promotes O
replication O
of O
some O
viruses O
[ O
55 O
]. O
Cathepsin O
L-deficient O
C57BL/6 O
mice O
(Ctsl O
−/− O
) O
infected O
with O
influenza O
A O
(H1N1) O
virus O
were O
not O
able O
to O
limit O
viral O
replication O
during O
early O
stages O
of O
infection. O
Moreover, O
Ctsl O
−/− O
mice O
exhibited O
larger O
viral O
loads O
in O
lungs O
and O
had O
higher O
mortality O
rates O
than O
infected O
Ctsl O
+/+ O
mice. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
a O
critical O
role O
of O
cathepsin O
L O
during O
influenza O
A O
virus O
infection O
in O
mice, O
as O
this O
protease O
appears O
to O
support O
both O
innate O
and O
adaptive O
antiviral O
immune O
responses O
[ O
55 O
]. O
Therefore, O
in O
the O
light O
of O
earlier O
findings O
by O
others, O
our O
observations O
suggest O
that O
decreased O
expression O
of O
cathepsins O
and O
cystatins O
induced O
by O
ECTV O
in O
JAWS O
II O
and O
GM-BM O
cells O
may O
serve O
not O
only O
to O
abrogate O
antiviral O
immune O
response O
initiated O
by O
these O
cells, O
but O
may O
also O
provide O
a O
more O
suitable O
environment O
for O
efficient O
replication O
in O
infected O
cDCs. O
This O
statement O
is O
supported O
by O
our O
results O
concerning O
increased O
ECTV O
titer O
in O

after O
removal O
of O
cathepsin O
B, O

showed O
that O

in O

therefore O
this O

play O
an O
important O
role O
in O

the O

Aside O
from O
protozoans, O
nematodes, O
cestodes, O
and O
trematodes, O
no O
acanthocephalan O
infections O
were O
here O
detected. O
Nonetheless, O
during O
necropsies, O
also O
cestode-parasitized O
animals O
were O
found. O
As O
such, O
in O
three O
dissected O
animals O
(2.8%), O
various O
long O
cestode O
specimens O
containing O
mature O
proglottids O
were O
diagnosed. O
Noteworthy O
was O
a O
heavily O
Nematotaenia-infected O
male O
Dyeing O
dart O
frog O
(Dendrobates O
tinctorius), O
which O
showed O
obstipation O
and O
congestion O
of O
ground O

in O
the O
gut O
lumen. O
Amphibians O
are O
known O
to O
be O
infected O
by O
different O
cestode O
genera, O
i.e., O
Proteocephalus, O
Ophiotaenia, O
Cephalochlamys, O
Bothriocephalus, O
Nematotaenia, O
Distoichometra, O
Cylindrotaenia, O
and O
Baerietta. O
Clinical O

manifest O
in O
affected O
animals O
during O
stress O
and/or O
in O
case O
of O
heavy O
infections O
(Mutschmann O
2010 O
). O
Then, O
ileus O
with O
obstipation, O
blood O
loss, O
necrosis O
of O
intestinal O
mucosa, O
edema O
or O
even O
death O
may O
also O
occur O
if O
untreated O
(Mutschmann O
2010 O
). O
Interestingly, O
a O
digenean O
trematode O
infection O
was O
found O
in O
a O
deceased O
yellow-bellied O
toad O
(Bombina O
variegata), O
showing O
clinical O
symptoms, O
including O
hydrocoeloma, O
generalized O
edema, O
and O
pathohistological O
findings, O
such O
as O
hepatitis, O
enteritis, O
nephritis, O
and O
a O
bacterial O
co-infection O
(Citrobacter O
spp. O
+). O
Amphibians O
represent O
not O
only O
intermediate O
hosts O
for O
various O
digenean O
trematode O
orders O
(e.g., O
Amphistomida, O
Echinostomatida, O
Gasterostomida, O
Hemiurida, O
Holostomida, O
Plagiorchida) O
but O
also O
second O
or O
even O
final O
hosts. O

Interestingly, O
however, O
two O
of O
the O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
from O
the O
basal O
species, O
Mitosporidium O
daphniae O
and O
Paramicrosporidium O
saccamoebae O
are O
also O
intronless. O
Since O
it O
is O
thought O
that O
intron O
loss O
is O
normally O
a O
derived O
character O
in O
fungal O
genomes, O
and O
occurs O
more O
frequently O
in O
the O
more O
recently O
evolved O
Ascomycetes O
[ O
81 O
], O
it O
is O
interesting O
that O
even O
highly O
basal O
clades O
might O
be O
subject O
to O
similar O
processes. O
Functional O
analysis O
of O
CLO/PXG-like O
proteins O
in O
fungi O
The O
A. O
flavus O
CLO/PXG O
has O
specific O
functions O
in O
sporulation O
and O
aflatoxin O
production O
There O
are O
several O
physiological O
roles O
of O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
that O
are O
specific O
to O
fungal O
development. O
For O
example, O
in O
the O
common O
pathogenic O
fungus, O
Aspergillus O
flavus, O
they O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
various O
aspects O
of O
aflatoxin O
storage, O
transport O
and O
secretion O
that O
have O
only O
been O
recognised O
very O
recently O
[ O
2 O
, O

] O
where O
it O
was O
reported O
that O
the O
silencing O
of O
A. O
flavus O
caleosin O
AfPXG O
or O
AflCLO, O
the O
first O
characterized O
fungal O
caleosin O
with O
an O
experimentally O
proven O
PXG O
activity O
[ O
82 O
], O
reduced O
fungal O
aflatoxicogenicity O
and O
its O
capacity O
to O
infect O
maize O
[ O

]. O
A O
similar O
role O
for O
A. O
parasiticus O
caleosin O
gene O
was O
also O
suggested O
[ O
83 O
]. O
The O
data O
presented O
in O
Fig. O
5 O
show O
that O
oxylipins O
decrease O
the O
aflatoxicogenicity O
of O
A. O
flavus O
in O
vitro, O
probably O
via O
the O
down-regulation O
of O
the O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
gene, O
AfPXG. O
As O
shown O
in O

a, O
in O

treatment O
of O
A. O
flavus O
with O
oxylipins O
extracted O
from O

development. O
While O
the O

Kristen O
Panfilio O
set O
the O
scene O
for O
evolutionary O
comparisons O
in O
her O
talk O
early O
in O
the O
meeting, O
discussing O
the O
analogies O
between O
insect O
and O
mammalian O
extraembryonic O
membranes. O
Although O
these O
tissues O
have O
different O
evolutionary O
and O
developmental O
origins, O
they O
can O
be O
considered O
functionally O
analogous. O
Indeed, O
it O
has O
been O
proposed O
that O
the O
evolution O
of O
extraembryonic O
membranes O
in O
insects O
facilitated O
the O
radiation O
of O
insects O
on O
land O
(Jacobs O
et O
al. O
2013 O
; O
Zeh O
et O
al. O
1989 O
) O
as O
one O
of O
these O
membranes, O
the O
serosa, O
protects O
against O
desiccation O
(Jacobs O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Similarly, O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
amniote O
egg O
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
supporting O
the O
radiation O
of O
vertebrates O
on O
land O
(reviewed O
in O
Ferner O
and O
Mess O
2011 O
). O
The O
field O
of O
evolution O
and O
development O
(Evo-Devo) O
has O
highlighted O
aspects O
of O
development O
that O
are O
conserved O
amongst O
phylogenetically O
diverse O
animals O
and O
therefore O
were O
likely O
present O
in O
the O
bilaterian O
ancestor; O
for O
example O
the O
role O
of O
BMP O
signalling O
in O
dorsoventral O
axis O
specification O
and O
the O
subdivision O
of O
the O
dorsoventral O
axis O
into O
distinct O
ectodermal O
domains O
(reviewed O
in O
Bier O
and O
De O
Robertis O
2015 O
). O
However, O
questions O
remain O
over O
how O
novelties, O
such O
as O
the O
extraembryonic O
membranes O
of O
insects O
and O
vertebrates, O
evolved O
and O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
that O
underpin O
these O
novelties. O
Understanding O
the O
molecular O
and O
evolutionary O
origins O
of O
the O
extraembryonic O
membranes O
and O
the O
intricate O
interplay O
between O
these O
membranes O
and O
the O
embryo O
in O
normal O
development O
and O
morphogenesis, O
in O
a O
phylogenetically O
diverse O
range O
animals, O
will O
allow O
us O
to O
examine O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
these O
molecular O
mechanisms O
overlap O
or O
converge. O
These O
comparisons O
may O
allow O
general O
inferences O
to O
be O
made O
about O
the O
evolution O
of O
novel O
cell O
types, O
cell O
fate O
and O
lineage O
specification O
as O
well O
as O
the O
role O
of O
co-option O
of O

such O
as O

Our O
previous O
studies O
showed O
that O
mRNA O

was O
downregulated O
during O

Furthermore, O

Interestingly, O
Wang O
and O
co-authors O
[ O

indicated O
that O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
level O
of O
cathepsins O
B, O

is O
reduced O
in O
human O

during O

which O
probably O
alters O
the O

However, O
it O
is O
not O
known O
if O
cathepsin O
expression O
in O
conventional O
DCs O
(cDCs) O
is O
affected O
during O
infection O

In O
the O

we O
asked O
whether O
cathepsins O
are O
targeted O
by O
the O
replicating O

in O
cDCs O
in O
in O

conditions. O
For O
this O
purpose O
we O
used O
an O

The O

what O

In O

The O

But O
how O
to O
choose O
an O

material O
to O

The O
heterogeneous O
structure O
of O
the O

for O

A O

36 O
, O
but O
also O
the O
application O
of O
cell-free O

is O
suitable. O
Due O
to O
its O

without O
any O

In O
addition, O
a O
good O
material O
for O
thoracic O

replacement O
should O
be O
stable O
and O

the O

thus O

Additionally, O
it O

Forty-five O

between O
November O

The O

were O
almost O

The O
main O

of O
the O

was O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
the O

that O
organic O

The O

The O
interviews O
were O
structured O
in O
three O

The O
first O
was O
a O
narrative O
description O
about O
how O
barley O
fits O
into O
the O

system. O
The O
second O
involved O
detailed O

and O
returns O
for O
growing O
barley. O

Validation O
of O
the O
LG27 O
QTL O

for O
susceptibility O

Since O
the O
QTL O
identified O
in O
‘Hort16A’ O
has O
the O
greatest O
effect, O
we O
predicted O
that O
this O
locus O
might O
be O
linked O
to O
susceptibility O
observed O
in O
diploid O
kiwifruit O
breeding O

For O
this O
purpose, O
we O
performed O
validation O
of O
the O
LG27 O
QTL O
in O
four O
different O

The O

and O
located O
within O
~300 O

on O
the O

(Supplementary O

The O

is O
a O

(which O
is O
a O

Similarly, O
the O

Conclusion O

The O
influence O

to O
plant O
physiology O
associated O
with O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O

multi-faceted, O
and O
increasing O

from O
recent O
literature O
reports O
suggest O
the O
crucial O
role O
played O
by O
stress O

in O
their O
production. O
Ample O
number O
of O
the O
studies O
(e.g. O
Tables O
1 O
and O
2 O
) O
have O
shown O
that O
both O
stress O
and O
defense O
responses O
are O
involved O
in O
SM O
in O
plants, O
although O
stress O
is O
the O
most O
investigated O
and O
understood. O
Because O
the O
responses O
are O
induced O
at O
subcellular O
level, O
their O
study O
is O
challenging. O
Thus, O
the O
use O
of O
biochemical O
and O
metabolic O
markers O
remains O
the O
most O
employed O
approach O
in O
drawing O
inferences O
on O
the O

of O
the O

of O
the O
reported O
studies O
using O

evaluated, O
rarely O
with O
whole O

or O
cellular O
levels. O
During O
both O
responses, O
specific O
and O
non-specific O
reactions O
that O
permit O
adjustment O
of O
resource O
utilization O
by O
the O

from O
primary O

(Fig. O

) O
may O
occur, O
with O
possible O
impact O
on O
biomass O
and O
SMs O
production. O
The O
responses O
are O
dependent O
on O
the O
metabolic O
capacity O
of O
the O
studied O
plant O
determined O
by O
the O
genetic O
background, O
depending O
on O
the O
genus, O
species, O

investigated, O
environmental O

and O

The O

the O

The O

AD; O
no O

The O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
to O
the O
accumulating O
Aβ O
and O
tau O
deposits O
worsens O
the O
pathological O
process O
and O
that O

may O
alleviate O
the O
process O
by O
inhibiting O
the O

and/or O
inhibiting O

(Wang O

evidence O
supporting O

the O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
ability O
of O
mutants O
to O
resist O
hydrogen O
peroxide O
and O
NO O
was O
decreased O
in O
an O
in O

sensitivity O
experiment. O
This O
result O
also O
supported O
the O
results O
of O
colonization O
experiments O
in O
vivo. O
Both O
active O
oxygen O
and O
reactive O
nitrogen O
in O
vivo O
were O
the O
environmental O
pressures O
that O
the O
bacteria O
would O
encounter. O
The O
defense O
against O
oxidative O
stress O
was O
crucial O
for O
the O
survival O
of O
bacteria O
in O
the O
body O
[ O

]. O
So O
far, O
the O
rpoB O
mutant O
has O
not O
been O
characterized O
in O
detail O
and O
may O
lack O
sufficient O
attention. O
The O
lacking O
dose O
of O
rifampin O
in O
use O
and O
the O
residual O
drug O
in O
the O
environment O
may O
provide O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
with O
the O
stress O
condition O
required O
for O
spontaneous O
mutation. O
The O
fitness O
cost O
of O
rpoB O
mutation O
may O
be O
due O
to O
changes O
in O
gene O
transcription O
level, O
and O
transcriptome O
analysis O
of O
mutant O
strains O
will O
be O
of O
great O
value. O
Therefore, O
further O
investigation O
and O
evaluation O
are O
necessary. O
Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
R. O
anatipestifer O
rifampin O
resistance O
is O
mainly O
derived O
from O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
mutation, O
whose O
types O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
strain O
background O
and O
environment O
stress. O
The O
spontaneous O
mutation O
of O
rpoB O
gene O
is O
concentrated O
in O
the O
mutation O
type O
with O
low O
fitness O
cost. O
And O
different O
rpoB O
mutations O
confer O
different O
fitness O

Our O

The O
relationship O
of O
excrement O
with O
toxicity O
occurs O
in O
many O
communities, O
for O
instance O
in O
a O
tropical O
community O
in O
southern O
Mexico O
(Ruan-Soto O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
We O
observed O
that O
in O
communities O
settled O
in O
rocky O
soils O
without O
grasslands, O
terrestrial O
mushrooms O
were O
considered O
toxic, O
thus O
only O
lignicolous O
ones O
were O
consumed. O
In O
addition, O
a O
belief O
that O
no O
toxic O
mushrooms O
existed O
was O
also O
recorded; O
in O
that O
case, O
mushrooms O
were O
perceived O
to O
only O
cause O
illness O
in O
individuals O
who O
do O
not O
consume O
them O
regularly. O
For O
the O
Wixaritari, O
a O
divine O
mushroom O
similar O
to O
each O
edible O
mushroom O
also O
exists. O
These O
mushrooms O
were O
considered O
God’s O
property, O
and O
people O
could O
become O
ill O
after O
consuming O
these O
species. O
When O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
visually O
distinguish O
a O
divine O
mushroom O
from O
an O
edible O
one O
by O
macromorphology, O
they O
used O
smell. O
Similar O
practices O
are O
recorded O
in O
the O
temperate O
zones O
of O
central O
Mexico O
where O
an O
unpleasant O
smell O
and O
taste O
are O
associated O
with O
toxic O
mushrooms O
(Ramírez-Terrazo O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
some O
species O
considered O
toxic O
by O
the O
Wixaritari O
are O
consumed O
in O
other O
areas O
in O
Mexico. O
For O
example, O
Cantharellus O
cinnabarinus O
is O
traditionally O
consumed O
in O
Oaxaca O
(Garibay-Orijel O
et O
al. O
2006 O
) O
but O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
Hongo O
de O
Dios O
(mushroom O
of O
God) O
or O
the O
Dueño O
(owner) O
of O
C. O
cibarius O
in O
Villa O
Guerrero. O
Despite O
the O
lack O
of O
official O
records, O
testimonies O
of O
three O
individuals O
who O
suffered O
mycetism O
or O
heard O
of O
cases O
of O
intoxications O
with O
mushrooms O
were O
recorded, O
although O
the O
places O
and O
names O
of O
those O
affected O
were O
uncertain. O
Mestizos O
considered O
cultivated O
white O
button O
mushrooms O
to O
be O
toxic O
because O
of O
stories O
in O
which O
one O
woman O
died O
after O
consuming O
them O
and O
another O
woman O
from O
the O
locality O
of O
Santa O
Rita O
fell O
ill O
after O
consuming O
them O
in O
a O
restaurant. O
This O
latter O
woman O
also O
affirmed O
that, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
that O
event, O
she O
would O
no O
longer O
eat O
any O
kind O
of O
mushroom. O
This O
story O
had O
repercussions O
because O
the O
sale O
of O
white O
button O
mushrooms O
was O
then O
halted O
in O
the O
markets O
and O
stores O
of O
the O
municipality. O
Accordingly, O
and O
since O
then, O
it O
is O
not O
common O
to O
find O
this O
product O
and O
when O
on O
sale O
the O
locals O
do O
not O
buy O
it. O

the O

an O

are O
epidemics O
in O

[ O

]. O
Patients O
with O
these O
diseases O
have O
a O
greater O
demand O
for O
medical O
care O
services. O
In O
this O
study, O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
rates O
were O
similar O
for O
patients O
with O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
infections O
and O
both O
patients O
exhibited O
significantly O
higher O
30-day O
mortality O
rates O
than O
CA O
infection O
patients. O
These O
results O
were O
similar O
to O
other O
studies O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
] O
and O
may O
largely O
be O
due O
to O
the O
variation O
in O
underlying O
diseases O
between O
the O
three O
groups, O
which O
are O
classical O
risk O
factors O
for O
prognosis O
of O
infectious O
diseases. O
An O
important O
finding O
in O
this O
study O
was O
that O
HCA O
K. O
pneumoniae O
strains O
exhibited O
similar O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
patterns O
with O
nosocomial O
strains, O
and O
both O
the O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
strains O
were O
significantly O
more O
resistant O
than O
the O
CA O
strains. O
This O
observation O
indicates O
that O
clinicians O
should O
consider O
similar O
empirical O
therapy O
for O
patients O
with O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections. O
A O
recent O
study O
in O
Taiwan O
reported O
that O
the O
rate O
of O
resistance O
in O
the O
group O
of O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
bacteremia O
was O
between O
those O
groups O
of O
nosocomial O
and O
CA O
bacteremia O
[ O
28 O
]. O
This O
discrepancy O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
different O
infection O
types O
of O
the O
population O
studied, O
or O
the O
regional O
differences O
of O
resistance O
characteristics O
in O
K. O
pneumoniae. O
In O
our O
study, O
29.7% O
of O
the O
HCA O
isolates O
were O
carbapenem O
resistant, O
35.9% O
expressed O
ESBL, O
and O
52.3% O
were O
MDR, O
indicating O
the O
severe O
drug O
resistance O
in O
isolates O
from O
the O
HCA O
infections. O
The O
high O
degree O
of O
antibiotic O
resistance O
in O
HCA O
strains O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
frequent O
contact O
with O
healthcare O
facilities O
among O
HCA O
patients, O
where O
the O
drug-resistant O
bacteria O
could O
spread. O
In O
addition, O
other O
factors O
such O
as O
overuse O
of O
antibiotics O
might O
also O
responsible O
for O
developing O
antimicrobial O
resistance. O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
increased O
attention O
should O
be O
paid O
to O
the O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections. O
The O

The O

was O
that O
the O
antimicrobial O

HCA O

was O
similar O

This O

at O

where O
more O

had O
been O

and O
approximately O

which O
could O
explain O
the O
serious O

in O

Given O
distinct O

more O
epidemiological O

on O
nosocomial, O

K. B-PATH

are O
needed O
to O

Conclusions O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections O
were O
similar O
to O
nosocomial O
infections O
regarding O
clinical O
features O
and O
antimicrobial O
resistance, O
and O
were O
different O
to O
CA O
infections. O
CRKP O
and O
ESBL-producing O
strains O
were O
mainly O
prevalent O
in O
patients O
with O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
infections, O
showing O
genetic O
diversity. O
Identical O
profiles O
observed O
in O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
CRKP O
strains O
suggested O
the O
transmission O
of O
CRKP O
among O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
patients. O
These O
findings O
indicate O
that O
empirical O
antimicrobial O
treatment O
for O
patients O
with O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections O
should O
be O
similar O
to O
those O
for O
patients O
with O
nosocomial O
infections O
and O
great O
attention O
should O
be O
paid O
to O
these O
infections O
due O
to O
the O
possible O
dissemination O
of O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
among O
them. O

The O
polygenic O
nature O
of O
resistance O
to O
the O
pathogen O
is O
both O
an O
advantage O
and O
a O
disadvantage O
for O
breeders. O
Quantitative O
resistances O
that O
aggregate O
small O
effects O
from O
multiple O
genes O
are O
relatively O
durable O
in O

to O
qualitative O

Furthermore, O

in O
the O

These O

such O

However, O

only O

a O

(Smokvina O

Also O

Among O

To O

fibronectin-binding O

A O
key O
role O
in O

has O
also O
been O
established O
for O
so-called O

in O
a O
number O
of O
lactobacilli O
such O
as O
L. O

(Hynonen O

Some O
probiotic O

the O

encode O
an O
aggregation-promoting O
factor O
sharing O
several O
features O
with O
the O
S-layer O
proteins O
(Turpin O
et O

However, O
previous O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
there O
is O
a O
testosterone O
surge O
in O
male O
mice O
shortly O
after O
delivery, O
with O
levels O
returning O
to O
baseline O
and O
no O
longer O
different O
from O
females O
by O
4–6 O
hours O
of O
life O
108 O
, O
109 O
. O
Furthermore, O
serum O
estrogen O
levels O
are O
similar O
in O
male O
and O
female O
neonatal O
rats O
110 O
. O
Thus, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
confluence O
of O
the O
developing O
innate O
immune O
system O
and O
relatively O
similar O
levels O
of O
sex O
hormones O
present O
in O
the O
early O
neonatal O
period O
obviate O
the O
sex O
differences O
reported O
with O
post-pubertal O
LPS O
challenge. O
There O
are O
important O
limitations O
to O
the O
current O
study. O
Here, O
we O
used O
systemic O
LPS O
challenge O
to O
stimulate O
the O
TLR4 O
mediated O
innate O
immune O
response. O
There O
are O
limitations O
to O
using O
endotoxemia O
as O
a O
clinically O
relevant O
model O
111 O
. O
Namely, O
LPS O
challenge O
is O
a O
single O
exposure O
to O
a O
sterile O
stimulus. O
While O
it O
is O
very O
useful O
to O
interrogate O
TLR O
signaling, O
because O
there O
is O
no O
ongoing O
bacterial O
presence O
as O
there O
is O
with O
an O
active O
infection, O
the O
conclusions O
that O
can O
be O
drawn O
are O
limited. O
Thus, O
while O
these O
studies O
represent O
a O
first O
step, O
more O
work O
must O
be O
done O
using O
more O
complex O
models O
to O
interrogate O
sex-differences O
in O
the O
innate O
immune O
response. O
Additionally, O
we O
assessed O
the O
transcriptional O
response O
at O
1 O
and O
5 O
hours O
after O
exposure O
to O
systemic O
LPS. O
It O
is O
quite O
likely O
that O
significant O
changes O
occur O
before O
the O
one-hour O
time O
point, O
and O
beyond O
the O
5 O
hour O
time O
point. O
One O
important O
remaining O
area O
to O
investigate O
is O
sex-differences O
in O
the O
factors O
controlling O
resolution O
of O
inflammation O
112 O
. O
Importantly, O
we O
did O
not O
assess O
any O
markers O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
responsible O
for O
the O
resolution O
of O

Overall, O

In O

Interestingly, O
in O
an O

the O

have O
indicated O
the O
presence O
of O
a O

extract O
that O
can O
activate O

but O
they O
did O
not O
identify O
this O

[ O

]. O
Based O
on O
these O
observations, O
we O
tried O
to O
verify O
whether O
this O
unknown O
water-soluble O
factor O
could O
be O
cyt O
c O
present O
in O
the O

of O

not. O
Efforts O

using O
an O

were O
not O
successful O
(Additional O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
under O
our O
test O
conditions, O
the O
protein O
is O
not O
secreted O
into O
the O

However, O
the O
possibilities O
that O
the O

might O
be O
secreted O
in O

to O
some O

ruled O
out. O
In O

As O
a O
broad-spectrum O
protease, O
PLG O
has O
many O
physiological O
functions, O
and O
it O
is O
understood O
that O
PLG O
interacts O
with O
cell O
surfaces O
for O
many O
of O
these O
roles. O
PLG, O
considered O
a O
proinflammatory O
cell O
activator, O
is O
a O
potent O
chemoattractant O
for O
monocytes, O
macrophages, O
and O
dendritic O
cells O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
There O
is O
also O
evidence O
that O
PLG O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
innate O
immunity O
by O
regulating O
macrophage O
phagocytosis O
[ O
15 O
] O
and O
can O
affect O
inflammatory O
cell O
function O
through O
the O
production O
of O
cytokines, O
reactive O
oxygen O
species, O
and O
other O
inflammatory O
mediators O
[ O
16 O
]. O
Previous O
work O
in O
our O
lab O
has O
shown O
that O
PLG O
−/− O
mice O
have O
a O
decreased O
neuroimmune O
response O
following O
hippocampal O
injection O
of O
LPS O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
however, O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
distinguish O
between O
the O
roles O
of O
brain- O
and O
liver-derived O
PLG O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
this O
response. O
We O
extended O
this O
study O
by O
using O
an O
ASO O
that O
specifically O
targets O
liver-produced O
PLG O
and O
found O
that O
it O
is O
plasma O
PLG O
that O
is O
crucial O
to O
regulating O
this O
response. O
Furthermore, O
we O
found O
that O
systemic O
challenge O
with O
LPS O
is O
sufficient O
to O
drive O
a O
neuroinflammatory O
response, O
and O
direct O
injection O
into O
the O
brain O
is O
not O
required. O
This O
situation O
better O
recapitulates O
what O
happens O
physiologically O
in O
the O
body O
in O
response O
to O
pathogens. O
PLG O
receptors O
are O
distributed O
broadly O
on O
many O
types O
of O
cells, O
including O
monocytes, O
macrophages, O
endothelial O
cells, O
and O
platelets O
[ O
16 O
]. O
The O
proteolytic O
functions O
of O
PLG O
allow O
it O
to O
degrade O
extracellular O
matrices O
and O
activate O
growth O
factors O
that O
aid O
in O
cell O
migration. O
Studies O
with O

we O

Studies O

These O
various O

Xenorhabdus O

The O
recognition O
of O
the O

was O
linked O
with O
the O
application O
of O
MLSA O
and O
whole O

data O
to O
EPN O
symbionts. O
Currently, O
26 O
species O
representing O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus O
have O
been O
described O
(Table O
1 O
). O
After O
establishment O
of O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
in O
1993, O
bacteria O
of O
the O
only O
species O
P. O
luminescens O
were O
divided O
into O
two O
groups, O
i.e. O
Heterorhabditis O
nematode O
symbionts O
and O
human O
clinical O
isolates O
(Akhurst O
et O
al. O
1996 O
). O

In O
P. O
chabaudi-infected O
mice, O
Fxr O
was O
downregulated O
at O
all O
three O
time O
points O
measured O
when O
compared O
to O
naïve O
control O
mice. O
Car O
was O
also O
down-regulated, O
but O
only O
at O
8 O
days O
post-infection O
and O
Rxrα, O
Pxr O
and O
Lxrα O
followed O
the O
same O
trend. O
Rxrα O
suppression O
was O
dramatic O
with O
expression O
levels O
less O
than O
1% O
of O
that O
measured O
in O
naïve O
control O
animals. O
While O
this O
might O
contribute O
to O
DME O
down-regulation O
at O
8 O
and O
12 O
days, O
it O
cannot O
explain O
the O
down-regulation O
of O
transcription O
of O
some O
DMEs O
at O
6 O
days O
post O
infection. O
The O
data O
shows O
that O
expression O
of O
Lxrα O
trended O
towards O
downregulation O
(Fig. O
4 O
). O
This O
was O
coupled O
with O
a O
&gt; O
10-fold, O
biphasic O
upregulation O
of O
Sult2b1 O
(Fig. O
3 O
). O
Among O
other O
functions, O
Sult2b1 O
sulfates O
oxysterols O
[ O
31 O
] O
and O
as O
noted O
above, O
reduced O
cellular O
oxysterol O
levels O
caused O
by O
increased O
expression O
of O
Sult2b1 O
have O
been O
associated O
with O
reduced O
expression O
of O
Lxr O
target O
genes. O
The O
observations O
of O
reduced O
expression O
of O
the O
Lxr O
target O
Cyp7a1 O
[ O
44 O
] O
(Fig. O
2 O
) O
and O
Apoe O
[ O
45 O
] O
(Additional O
file O
5 O
) O
are O
consistent O
with O
this O
idea O
and O
also O
with O
the O
observation O
that O
Lxrα O
itself O
was O
down-regulated. O
However, O
another O
Lxr O
target O
gene, O
Abcg1 O
[ O
45 O
] O
was O
upregulated O
more O
than O
fivefold, O
whilst O
transcription O
of O
both O
Srbp1c O
[ O
31 O
] O
and O
Abca1 O
[ O
46 O
] O
were O
comparatively O
unaffected O
by O
infection, O
suggesting O
that O
there O
may O
be O
redundancy O
in O
the O
Lxr O
pathway O
involved O
in O
regulation O
of O
these O
genes O
during O
Plasmodium O
infection. O
The O
upregulation O
of O
Sult2b1 O
is O
a O
novel O
observation O
that O
suggests O
a O
possible O
role O
of O
this O
enzyme O
in O
the O
host O
response O
to O
Plasmodium O
infection. O

As O
the O
original O
k13 O
PCR O
strategy O
was O
not O
altered O
[ O
8 O
], O
the O
improvement O
in O
sensitivity O
was O
achieved O
by O
optimizing O
the O
extraction O
efficiency O
from O
DBS. O
This O
was O
performed O
by O
taking O
a O
two-step O
approach: O
first, O
by O
using O
a O
qPCR O
strategy O
for O
an O
established O
parasite O
marker O
such O
as O
18S O
rDNA, O
extraction O
conditions O
that O
incrementally O
improved O
parasite O
DNA O
recovery O
were O
identified; O
second, O
these O
conditions O
were O
combined O
and O
then O
tested O
for O
their O
impact O
on O
the O
k13 O
PCR O
assay. O
In O
nearly O
all O
instances, O
conditions O
that O
improved O
DNA O
recovery O
in O
the O
first O
step O
also O
performed O
similarly O
in O
the O
second. O
However, O
in O
one O
instance, O
that O
of O
incubation O
time, O
it O
was O
found O
that O
a O
2 O
h O
incubation O
at O
65 O
°C O
was O
superior O
to O
1 O
h. O
This O
appears O
to O
be O
specific O
for O
the O
k13 O
PCR, O
as O
a O
2-h O
incubation O
did O
not O
improve O
the O
quantitative O
recovery O
of O
18S O
rDNA O
as O
assessed O
by O
qPCR O
(Additional O
file O
2 O
) O
or O
18S O
rRNA O
as O
previously O
reported O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Importantly, O
overnight O
incubations O
were O
found O
to O
be O
highly O
detrimental O
in O
all O
instances O
and O
thus O
should O
be O
avoided. O
This O
new O
protocol O
vastly O
outperforms O
Qiagen O
kit-based O
methods O
currently O
used O
for O
DBS, O
allowing O
for O
the O
successful O
amplification O
of O
parasitaemias O
as O
low O
as O
500 O
parasites/mL. O
This O
may O
have O
ramifications O
for O
current O
surveillance O
efforts O
for O
drug O
resistance O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
and O
other O
low-transmission O
settings O
where O
parasitaemias O
tend O
to O
be O
low O
in O
both O
clinical O
and O
asymptomatic O
infections, O
as O
compared O
to O
higher O
transmission O
settings O
[ O
15 O
, O
16 O
]. O
A O
recent O
study O
reported O
an O
average O
parasite O
density O
of O
approximately O
5000 O
parasites/mL O
for O
asymptomatic O
P. O
falciparum O
infections O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
[ O
16 O
]. O
It O
is, O
therefore, O
notable O
that O
the O
current O
protocol O
was O
able O
to O
amplify O
all O
DBS O
samples O
containing O
5000 O
and O
2000 O
parasites/mL, O
respectively. O
For O
future O
studies, O
it O
will O
be O
important O
to O
determine O
how O
this O
method O
performs O
in O
samples O
obtained O
from O
the O
field. O

Typhimurium) O

An O
example O
of O

the O

Discussion O
This O
initial O
study O
conducted O
in O
France O
on O
the O
costs O
of O
community O
UTIs O
in O
women O
over O
18 O
years O
of O
age O
estimated O
a O
total O
cost O
from O
the O
societal O
perspective O
of O
€58 O
million O
in O
2012, O
€44 O
million O
for O
direct O
costs O
and O
€14 O
million O
for O
indirect O
costs. O
Half O
of O
this O
cost O
was O
supported O
by O
the O
French O
National O
Health O
Insurance, O
and O
half O
was O
supported O
by O
the O
patients O
(before O
private O
complementary O
health O
insurance O
participation). O
Visits O
represented O
the O
largest O
expense O
item O
followed O
by O
sick O
leave O
and O
prescription O
drugs. O
Although O
very O
expensive, O
hospitalizations O
were O
rare O
and O
therefore O
represented O
the O
smallest O
expense O
item. O
The O
costs O
for O
75 O
% O
of O
the O
women O
were O
below O
the O
mean O
cost. O
Additional O
visits O
with O
specialist O
physicians, O
ultrasounds, O
hospitalizations O
and O
sick O
leave O
concerned O
less O
than O
one O
quarter O
of O
the O
women. O
The O
important O
costs O
of O
these O
additional O
health O
care O
procedures O
clearly O
increased O
the O
mean O
UTI O
cost. O
An O
important O
strength O
of O
this O
study O
was O
the O
use O
of O
a O
sampling O
design. O
This O
allowed O
to O
correct O
the O
bias O
due O
to O
drop-outs O
and O
geographical O
repartition O
and O
to O
generalize O
with O
caution O
the O
cost O
of O
UTIs O
to O
the O
population O
of O
women O
over O
18 O
years O
of O
age O
who O
visit O
GPs O
for O
presumed O
UTIs. O
Furthermore, O
to O
estimate O
the O
possible O
costs O
according O
to O
expense O
items O
as O
accurately O
as O
possible, O
the O
maximum O
amounts O
of O
data O
from O
the O
French O
National O
Health O
Insurance O
and O
the O
French O
National O
Institute O
of O
Statistics O
and O
Economic O
Studies O
were O
used. O
The O
use O
of O
the O
EGB O
allowed O
for O
the O
accounting O
of O
possible O
differences O
in O
care O
consumption O
according O
to O
gender O
and O
excess O
fees O
according O
to O
medical O
specialties O
and O
French O
departments, O
particularly O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
costs O
of O
physician O
visits O
[ O

]. O
The O
systematic O
collection O
of O
urine O
sample O
from O
all O
women O
who O
visited O
their O
GPs O
for O
suspected O
UTIs O
permitted O
the O
distinction O
between O
clinical O
UTIs O
with O
positive O
urine O
cultures O
from O
clinical O
UTIs O
with O
negative O
urine O
cultures O
and O
the O
estimation O
of O
their O
related O
costs. O
Furthermore, O
to O
estimate O
the O
real O
cost, O
the O
women’ O
declarations O
were O
preferred O
to O
the O
GPs’ O
declaration O
to O
account O
only O
for O
prescriptions O
that O
were O
actually O
utilized O
or O
purchased. O
This O
study O
has O
some O
limitations O
that O
might O
have O
resulted O
in O
the O
over- O
or O
underestimation O
of O
the O
costs O
of O
UTIs. O

Many O
species O
of O

form O
intimate O

with O

and O
algae O
that O
range O
from O

However, O
while O
both O
the O

Oxylipin O

both O

crucial O
roles O

In O
several O

in O

has O
been O
reported O
that O
CLO/PXG O

plays O
a O

role O

Examples O

the O

of O

by O
the O

Puccinia O

and O

[ O

In O
line O

this, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
A. O

has O
peroxygenase O
activity O
and O
mediates O
fungal O
development O
and O
aflatoxin O

[ O

Our O

So O
far, O
only O
some O
strains O
of O
L. O
casei O
have O
been O
found O
to O
metabolize O
MI O
with O
poor O
efficiency. O
One O
should O
note O
that O
even O
the O
presence O
of O
genes O
encoding O
enzymes O
for O
MI O
metabolism O
may O
not O
be O
sufficient O
to O
confer O
an O
ability O
to O
utilize O
MI O
(Zhang O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Vinay-Lara O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
Moreover, O
we O
identified O
glgBCDAP-amyB O
genes O
connected O
with O
glycogen O
metabolism O
(LCAKO_2211 O
to O
LCAKO_2216) O
organized O
identically O
to O
operons O
of O
other O
Lactobacillus O
species O
(Goh O
and O
Klaenhammer O
2014 O
). O
It O
remains O
to O
be O
determined O
why O
IBB3423 O
cannot O
utilize O
glycogen O
despite O
having O
the O
relevant O
genes. O
Several O
reasons O
could O
be O
at O
play, O
including O
a O
lack O
of O
expression O
of O
these O
genes O
or O
their O
mutation. O
Adherence O
to O
the O
intestinal O
surface O
is O
considered O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
features O
of O
probiotic O
bacteria, O
as O
it O
facilitates O
colonization O
of O
the O
host O
and O
thus O
persistent O
protection O
against O
pathogens O
(Jankowska O
et O
al. O
2008 O
; O
Lim O
2012 O
). O
Bacteria O
of O
the O
genus O
Lactobacillus O
are O
able O
to O
adhere O
to O
various O
surfaces, O
but O
this O
feature O
is O
highly O
variable O
due O
to O
the O
variable O
presence O
of O
genes O
involved O
in O
adhesion. O
The O
adherence O
of O
L. O
paracasei O
subsp. O
paracasei O
IBB3423 O
to O
most O
surfaces O
is O
even O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
the O
best O
adhesive O
L. O
rhamnosus O
GG O
strain. O
Such O
high O
adhesiveness O
of O
a O
dairy O
strain O
is O
unexpected, O
as O
strains O
deriving O
from O
milk O
environments O
typically O
display O
weaker O
adhesion O
efficiency O
than O
those O
isolated O
from O
intestines/feces O
(Douillard O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
The O
very O
high O
adhesive O
capacity O
of O
IBB3423 O
appears O
to O
reflect O
the O
presence O
of O
as O
many O
as O
59 O
genes O
encoding O
proteins O
containing O
putative O
adhesion O
domains, O
among O
them O
are O
SpaCBA O

In O
this O

viable O

were O
hypothesized O
to O
gain O

the O
cancerous O

via O
a O
retrograde O

In O
terms O
of O

on O

function, O
it O
was O
experimentally O
shown O
that O
bacterial O
translocation O

and O

generated O
a O
Th1 O
memory O

to O
the O

In O
the O
scenario O
of O
bacterial O
translocation, O
live O
bacteria O
gaining O
access O
to O
spleen, O
lymph O
nodes, O
or O
tumor O
may O
initiate O
a O
strong O
immune O
response O
by O
providing O
both O
foreign O
antigens O
and O
adjuvants O
(MAMPs/PAMPs). O
Consequently, O
tumor O

may O
ensue O
due O
to O
T O
cell O
cross-reactivity O
or O
bystander O
activation O
within O
the O
tumor O

(TME). O
Thus, O
commensals O

bolster O
anti-tumor O

through O
both O

antigenicity O
as O

Under O
this O

In O

study O
of O
464 O
IDUs O
in O
Kabul, O
the O
prevalence O
of O
HBsAg O
and O

were O
6.5% O
(95% O

In O
another O

the O
prevalence O
of O

were O
36.0% O
(95% O

found O
in O

the O

Therefore, O
HIV, O
HCV O
and O
HBV O
prevention O
programs O
are O
urgently O
needed O
in O
Afghanistan O
and O
regional O
variations O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
programming O
to O
prevent O
transmission O
of O
blood-borne O
disease. O
Yet O
in O
Afghanistan, O
there O
are O
no O
accurate O
reports O
of O
prevalence O
of O
blood-borne O
viruses O
in O
hemophilia O
patients. O
In O
the O
present O
paper, O
we O
determine O
the O
prevalence O
of O
transfusion-transmitted O
diseases O
including O
HIV, O
HCV, O
HBV, O
HTLVI O
and O
parvovirus O
B19 O
among O
80 O
Afghanistan O
hemophilia O
patients. O
Result O
A O
total O
of O
80 O
hemophilia O
male O
patients O
screened O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
age O
range O
was O
2 O
to O
38 O
years O
with O
a O
mean O
age O
of O
13.66 O
(SD O
8.95). O

Although O
compelling O
evidence O
in O
support O
of O
the O
later O
hypothesis O
comes O
from O
recently O
published O
data O
[ O
13 O
], O
we O
did O
not O
find O
evidence O
of O
this O
in O
our O
studies O
using O
weanling O
mice. O
It O
is O
important O
to O
point O
out O
that O
this O
may O
be O
due O
entirely O
to O
age O
at O
primary O
infection, O
since O
data O
from O
other O
labs[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
] O
and O
unpublished O
data O
from O
our O
laboratory O
demonstrate O
that O
infections O
at O
earlier O
time O
points O
(i.e., O
7 O
days O
post-partum) O
leads O
to O
long-term O
immune O
and O
pulmonary O
consequences O
for O
the O
host. O
Respiratory O
tract O
viral O
infections O
account O
for O
approximately O
85% O
of O
asthma O
exacerbations O
in O
children, O
and O
80% O
of O
those O
children O
have O
allergic O
asthma[ O
11 O
, O
38 O
, O
39 O
, O
42 O
, O
43 O
]; O
therefore, O
it O
is O
imperative O
that O
we O
understand O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
viral O
infections O
lead O
to O
asthma O
exacerbations. O
Although O
it O
remains O
unclear O
what O
is O
responsible O
for O
RSV-enhanced O
allergic O
inflammation O
in O
the O
lung, O
what O
is O
obvious O
is O
that O
AHR O
in O
RSV O
and O
Ova O
exposed O
mice O
does O
not O
correlate O
with O
RSV O
titer. O
In O
contrast, O
AHR O
does O
appear O
to O
correlate O
with O
increased O
pulmonary O
eosinophilia, O
lymphocyte O
cell O
numbers, O
a O
decrease O
in O
macrophage O
numbers, O
and O
most O
importantly O
pulmonary O
remodeling. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
exposure O
to O
allergens O
and O
RSV O
leads O
to O
increased O
structural O
changes O
in O
the O
conducting O
airways. O
And O
it O
is O
these O
structural O
changes O
in O
the O
developing O
lung O
that O
may O
be O
ultimately O
responsible O
for O
the O
progressive O
development O
of O
the O
chronic O
inflammatory O
disease O
state O
known O
as O
adult O
asthma. O
Conclusion O
Weanling O
mice O
exposed O
to O
allergen O
and O
RSV O
exhibit O
enhanced O
immune O
cell O
responses, O
which O
are O
accompanied O
by O
long-term O
changes O
in O
airway O
structure O
and O
function. O
Although O
this O
increased O
pathologic O
response O
was O
associated O
with O
RSV O
infection, O
the O
enhanced O
pathologies O
were O
not O
dependent O
upon O
pulmonary O
viral O
titer. O
Airway O
remodeling O
was O
evident O
in O
the O
lungs O
of O
adult O
mice O
exposed O
to O
RSV O
and O
Ova O
and O
may O
provide O
an O
explanation O
for O
observations O
suggesting O
that O
viral O
exacerbations O
of O
asthma O
have O
long-term O
physiological O
consequences. O
Airway O
remodeling O
was O
correlated O
with O
elevated O
levels O
of O
TNF-α O
in O
the O
lungs. O

Among O
them, O
the O

In O
this O
experiment, O
we O
investigated O
the O
differences O
in O
the O
competitiveness O
of O
the O
mutant O
and O
parental O
strains O
in O

The O
data O
were O

literature O
[ O

and O
the O
results O
are O
shown O
in O
Table O

This O
result O
was O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
the O
individual O
growth O
performance, O
and O
most O
mutant O
strains O
had O
similar O
growth O
abilities O
to O
their O
parental O
strains. O
The O
relative O
fitness O
of O
the O
10 O
types O
of O
mutations O
was O
more O
than O
0.9, O
the O
relative O
fitness O
of O
the O
3 O
types O
of O
mutations O
was O
slightly O
reduced, O
the O
size O
ranged O
from O
0.8 O
to O
0.9, O
and O
two O
types O
of O
mutations O
(H491D O
and O
535::G) O
were O
severely O
impaired O
in O
fitness O
and O
decreased O
to O
approximately O
0.6. O
Combined O
with O
the O
growth O
characteristics O
of O
each O
strain, O
the O
mutants O
can O
be O
roughly O
divided O
into O
three O
categories: O
(i) O
the O
strains O
whose O
growth O
was O
similar O
to O
the O
parental O
strain O
and O
with O
low O
fitness O
cost, O
such O
as O
R494K O
and O
H491Y; O
(ii) O
the O
strains O
whose O
growth O
was O
similar O
to O
the O
parental O
strain O
and O
had O
a O
certain O
fitness O
cost, O
such O
as O
S496 O
L O
+ O
535::G; O
(iii) O
the O
strains O
whose O
growth O
was O
suppressed O
with O
higher O
fitness O
cost, O
such O
as O
H491D O
and O
485::TAA. O
The O
results O
of O
this O
experiment O
also O
showed O
that O
different O
types O
of O
rpoB O
mutations O
conferred O
varying O
degrees O
of O
fitness O
costs O
to O
R. O
anatipestifer, O
and O
there O
was O
also O
a O
large O
difference O
in O
the O
fitness O
of O
mutation O
types O
produced O
by O
the O
same O
amino O
acid O
site. O

when O
the O

together O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
most O
of O
the O
Pelnac O
did O
not O
degrade O
in O
the O
rats O
for O
7 O
days O
according O
to O
Fig. O

we O
speculated O
that O

The O
results O
of O
this O

show O
that O
using O

split-thickness O
skin O

with O
Pelnac O
as O
an O
overlay O
accelerates O
wound O

through O
enhanced O
cell O

This O

the O

connecting O
the O

The O
expression O

Ki-67, O
a O
marker O
of O
proliferation, O
was O
higher O
in O
the O
Pelnac O
group O
than O
in O
the O
Vaseline O
group, O
indicating O
that O
Pelnac O
may O
accelerate O
wound O
healing O
by O
providing O
a O
physical O
scaffold O
for O
proliferating O
cells. O
The O
local O
microenvironment O
of O
the O
wound O
also O
influences O
tissue O
repair. O
We O
found O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
VEGF—which O
regulates O
angiogenesis—was O
elevated O
in O
the O
Pelnac O
group, O
which O
could O
also O
promote O
wound O
healing. O
Pelnac O
also O
decreased O
and O
increased O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
scar-related O
growth O
factors O
TGF-β1 O
and O
TGF-β3, O
respectively, O
to O
minimize O
scar O
formation. O

it O

It O
is O

lipid O

originate O
in O
fungal O
spores O
and O

the O

also O
play O
roles O

Alternatively, O
beneficial O
or O
immune-potentiating O
bacteria O
could O
be O
prepared O
as O
a O
probiotic O
and O
provided O
as O
an O
immunotherapy O
adjuvant. O
Once O
molecular O
mechanisms O
are O
determined, O
genetic O
manipulation O
of O
the O
selected O
bacteria O
could O
be O
utilized O
to O
maximize O
beneficial O
effects. O
Historically, O
certain O
bacterial O
species O
have O
been O
some O
of O
the O
most O
amenable O
organisms O
to O
genetic O
manipulation, O
and O
the O
breadth O
of O
tools O
available O
to O
study O
and O
modify O
bacteria O
continues O
to O
expand. O
This O
technology O
allows O
the O
modification O
of O
a O
bacterium’s O
existing O
function O
or O
the O
introduction O
of O
completely O
novel O
genes O
[ O
123 O
]. O
For O
example, O
a O
Bacteroides O
strain O
modified O
to O
carry O
a O
gene O
cluster O
to O
utilize O
porphyran O
stabilized O
its O
engraftment O
into O
mice O
fed O
a O
porphyran-supplemented O
diet O
[ O
124 O
]. O
This O
strategy O
effectively O
creates O
a O
unique O
metabolic O
niche O
for O
the O
exogenous O
microbe O
and O
presents O
a O
potential O
means O
to O
facilitate O
probiotic O
efficacy. O
Bacteria O
may O
also O
be O
genetically O
modified O
to O
drive O
expression O
of O
a O
metabolite O
of O
interest O
[ O
125 O
]. O
For O
well-characterized O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Escherichia O
coli, O
genetic O
manipulation O
is O
routine, O
but O
for O
many O
human O
commensals, O
incomplete O
genomic O
information O
leaves O
fewer O
tools O
available O
for O
these O
strategies O
currently. O
To O
circumvent O
this O
limitation, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
express O
bacterial O
genes O
of O
interest O
heterologously O
in O
common O
laboratory O
hosts O
such O
as O
E. O
coli O
or O
Bacillus O
subtilis O
[ O
125 O
]. O
An O
alternative O
approach O
to O
adding O
beneficial O
bacteria O
to O
the O
microbiota O
is O
selective O
depletion O
of O
harmful O
species O
from O
the O
community. O
Bacteriophages O
are O
viruses O
that O
can O
infect O
and O
kill O
bacteria O
and O
are O
naturally O
present O
in O
the O
microbiome O
where O
they O
play O
a O
key O
role O
in O
preserving O
community O
equilibrium. O
Some O
phages O
have O
been O
used O
preclinically O
to O
decrease O
pathogenic O
bacteria O
while O
leaving O
the O
commensal O
community O
intact, O
and O
could O
be O
further O
engineered O
to O
target O
certain O
bacterial O
species O
or O
strains O
[ O
123 O
]. O
Finally, O
if O
a O
bacterial O
metabolic O
pathway O
is O
identified O
along O
with O
defined O
metabolic O
products O
that O
mediate O
improved O
anti-tumor O
immunity O
and O
immunotherapy, O
then O
small O
molecule O
entities O
could O
be O
tested O
as O
candidate O
immune-potentiating O
drugs. O

Despite O
this O
burden, O
few O
studies O
have O
examined O
the O
costs O
of O
UTIs. O
In O
1997, O
an O
American O
study O
estimated O
that O
the O
burden O
of O
UTIs O
represented O
100,000 O
hospitalizations, O
7 O
million O
visits O
and O
1 O
million O
admissions O
to O
emergency O
services O
[ O
11 O
]. O
In O
1995, O
UTI O
costs O
were O
estimated O
at O
$1.6 O
billion O
in O
the O
USA O
($659 O
million O
in O
direct O
costs O
and O
$936 O
million O
in O
indirect O
costs) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
direct O
cost O
per O
patient O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
between O
112 O
and O
172 O
dollars O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
France, O
these O
costs O
are O
unknown. O
The O
main O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
calculate O
the O
direct O
and O
indirect O
UTI O
costs O
(including O
cystitis O
and O
acute O
pyelonephritis) O
in O
women O
over O
18 O
years O
of O
age O
who O
visit O
general O

in O
France. O
The O
secondary O
objectives O
were O
to O
calculate O
the O
costs O
of O
suspected O
UTIs O
with O
negative O
urine O
cultures O
and O
to O
compare O
the O

of O
UTIs O
due O

with O
those O
of O

by O

The O

this O

the O

A O
two-stage O

that O

The O

The O

For O

As O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
executors O
of O
nutrient O
transport, O
plant O
AMTs O
also O
play O
key O
roles O
in O
the O
interactions O
between O
plants O
and O
microbes, O
especially O
obligate O
biotrophic O
fungi. O
An O
increasing O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
plant O
AMTs O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
mutualistic O
symbiosis O
of O
Arbuscular O
mycorrhizae O
(AM) O
fungi. O
Most O
of O
these O
AMTs O
belong O
to O
the O
AMT2 O
subfamily O
and O
are O
highly O
or O
exclusively O
expressed O
in O
AM-colonized O
roots O
[ O
27 O
]. O
For O
example, O
two O
sorghum O
AMT2 O
genes, O
SbAMT3;1 O
and O
SbAMT4, O
were O
induced O
to O
express O
in O
roots O
colonized O
by O
arbuscular O
fungi O
[ O
28 O
]. O
SbAMT3;1 O
knockdown O
plants O
showed O
greatly O
reduced O
uptake O
of O
ammonium O
from O
the O
AM O
network O
and O
less O
growth O
stimulation O
by O
AM O
fungal O
colonization O
[ O
29 O
]. O
Except O
for O
ammonium O
transport, O
some O
AMT O
members O
serve O
as O
transceptors O
that O
sense O
as O
well O
as O
transport O
their O
substrates. O
In O
Medicago O
colonized O
by O
Arbuscular O
mycorrhizae, O
AMT2;3 O
is O
located O
in O
the O
periarbuscular O
membrane O
and O
is O
required O
for O
the O
suppression O
of O
premature O
arbuscule O
degeneration O
in O
pad4 O
mutants O
under O
low-nitrogen O
conditions O
[ O
30 O
]. O
To O
date, O
there O
are O
only O
a O
few O
reports O
related O
to O
AMT O
function O
in O
plant-pathogen O
interactions. O
The O
Arabidopsis O
AMT1.1 O

displays O
enhanced O
resistance O
against O
Plectosphaerella O
cucumerina O
and O
reduced O
susceptibility O
to O
Pseudomonas O

[ O

Another O
study O
demonstrated O
that O
three O
AMT1-type O

TaAMT1;1a, O
TaAMT1;1b, O

Discussion O
Poxviruses, O
including O
ECTV, O
have O
evolved O
numerous O
mechanisms O
to O
evade O
the O
host O
immune O
response O
[ O
20 O
]. O
To O
further O
elaborate O
on O
the O
immune O
evasion O
strategies O
engaged O
by O
ECTV, O
we O
scrutinized O
the O
impact O
of O
ECTV O
infection O
on O
selected O
cathepsins O
(B, O
L, O
S) O
and O
cystatins O
(A, O
B, O
C) O
regarding O
gene O
and O
protein O
expression O
in O
murine O
JAWS O
II O
and O
GM-BM O
cells. O
Selection O
of O
the O
cells O
to O
analyze O
was O
dictated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
dendritic O
cells O
are O
in O
the O
forefront O
of O
subsequent O
immune O
responses O
ensuing O
infection. O
But O
to O
be O
able O
to O
attribute O
any O
changes O
to O
the O
viral O
activity O
only O
and O
not O
to O
the O
virus-induced O
apoptotic O
process, O
we O
first O
determined O
the O
apoptotic O
rate O
in O
murine O
JAWS O
II O
and O
GM-BM O
cells. O
ECTV O
infection O
of O
JAWS O
II O
cells O
at O
a O
low O
MOI O
(0.5) O
induces O
early O
apoptosis O
at O
24 O
h O
following O
infection, O
in O
contrast O
to O
GM-BM O
cells O
in O
which O
the O
induction O
of O
apoptosis O
was O
not O
detected O
during O
the O
entire O
virus O
replication O
cycle. O
Therefore, O
the O
observation O
at O
12 O
and O
24 O
hpi O
in O
both O
cells O
types O
that O
expression O
of O
cathepsins O
and O
cystatins O
was O
significantly O
reduced, O
and O
degradation O
of O
DQ-OVA O
was O
altered, O
indicates O
that O
such O
inhibitory O
effects O
were O
not O
caused O
by O
the O
apoptotic O
process O
and O
may O
strictly O
be O
related O
to O
the O
immunomodulatory O
strategies O
engaged O
by O
the O
virus. O
Moreover, O
ECTV O
itself O
encodes O
a O
variety O
of O
proteins O
to O
overcome O
apoptosis O
[ O
38 O
], O
including O
EVM025 O
that O
inhibits O
activity O
of O
pro-apoptotic O
Bak O
and O
Bax, O
and O
stabilizes O
mitochondrial O
membrane O
integrity O
[ O
39 O
]. O
Our O
results O
indicated O
a O
profound O
down-regulation O
of O
both O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
expression O
of O
cathepsin O
B, O
L O
and O
S, O
and O
cystatins O

introduced O

Committee O
on O
Reconciliation O
of O
Approaches O
of O
Bacterial O

(Wayne O

) O
and O
the O
80% O
DDH O
threshold O
proposed O
by O
Vandamme O
et O
al. O
( O
1996 O
) O
effectively O
complemented O
the O
minimal O
standards O
in O
the O
taxonomy O
of O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus, O
respectively. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
rapid O
development O
of O
the O
gene O
sequencing O
techniques O
changed O
the O
approach O
to O
the O
definition O
of O
bacterial O
species. O
It O
became O
apparent O
that O
using O
solely O
ribosomal O
subunit O
sequences O
for O
taxonomic O
purposes O
was O
not O
suitable O
due O
to O
their O
low O
variation O
and O
lateral O
gene O
transfer O
(LTG) O
among O
different O
bacterial O
species O
(Akhurst O

2006 O
; O
Lee O
and O
Stock O
2010a O
; O
Tailliez O
et O

2010 O
). O
To O
overcome O
this O
limitation, O
a O
more O
robust O
phylogenetic O
relationship O
framework O
for O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
was O
developed O
by O
comparing O
the O

of O

coding O

(Sergeant O

2006 O
; O
An O
and O
Grewal O
2010 O
; O
Lee O

). O
Finally, O
multilocus O
sequence O
analysis O
(MLSA) O
of O
genes O
coding O
for O
proteins O
with O
conserved O
functions, O
called O
housekeeping O
genes, O
was O
widely O
adopted O
for O
inference O
of O
the O
phylogenetic O
relationships O
of O
nematode O
microsymbionts O
and O
gradually O
replaced O
the O
single-gene O
analysis O
and O
time-consuming O
DDH O
in O
identification O

of O
these O
bacteria O
(Maiden O

1998 O
; O
Stackebrandt O
et O

2002 O
; O
Glaeser O

2015 O
). O
Nevertheless, O
the O
16S O
rDNA O

is O
still O
a O
common O
approach O
for O
preliminary O

of O

making O

a O
pro-inflammatory O

in O
the O

of O

(Holmes O

). O
In O
addition, O
chronic O

during O

could O
negatively O
affect O
brain O
development O
and O
lower O
the O
“cognitive O

(Borenstein O
et O

2006 O
). O
The O
researchers O
noted O
that O
the O
affected O
AD O

are O
largely O
inflamed, O
glial O
cells O
rushing O
to O
the O

that O

ill O
and O
trying O
to O
clean O
up O

but O
once O
up O
to O
this O
area, O
they O
in O
fact O
are O
urged O
to O
liberate O
more O

precipitate O
in O
the O

of O

which O

more O

and O
so O
on. O
According O
to O
Balin O

and O
other O
studies, O
amyloid O
proteins O
play O
a O
part O
in O
the O
disease, O
but O
only O
in O

). O
Recent O

showed O
that O
Aβ O
may O
play O
a O
protective O
role O
in O
innate O
immunity O
and O
infectious O
or O
sterile O
inflammatory O
stimuli O
may O
drive O
amyloidosis O
and O
that O
Aβ O
oligomerization, O
a O
behavior O
traditionally O
viewed O
as O
intrinsically O
pathological, O
may O
be O
necessary O
for O
the O
antimicrobial O
activities O
of O
the O
peptide, O
which O
mean O
that O
Aβ O
serves O
to O
protect O
the O
brain O
from O
invading O
microbes O
(Kumar O
et O
al., O
2016 O
). O
In O

study O
of O
Chlamydia O
pneumoniae O
showed O
that O
the O
infection O
of O
monocytes O
could O
stimulate O
innate O
and O
adaptive O
immune O
responses O
relevant O
to O
those O
in O

(Balin O

; O
Lim O
et O

Hoban O

elucidated O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
microbial O
influence O
by O
investigating O
changes O
in O
the O
homeostatic O
regulation O
of O
neuronal O
transcription O
of O
germ-free O
mice O
within O
the O

and O
showed O
that O
the O
microbiome O
is O
necessary O
for O
appropriate O
and O
dynamic O
regulation O
of O
myelin-related O
genes O
(the O
formation O
of O

with O
clear O
implications O
for O
cortical O

at O
an O

(Hoban O

Integrating O
this O
information O
and O
the O
transcriptome O
mapping O
onto O
the O
phenylpropanoid O
pathway O
suggests O
a O
flux O
directed O
towards O
the O
production O
of O
synapaldehyde O
and O
synapoyl-CoA O
representing O
precursors O
of O
lignin. O
Malate, O
citric O
acid, O
glucose O
and O
fructose O
fuel O
the O
glycolysis O
and O
oxidative O
phosphorylation O
pathways O
and O
satisfy O
the O
increased O
energy O
demand. O
In O
addition, O
glucose O
probably O
is O
utilized O
for O
cellulose O
synthesis. O
Glucuronic O
acid O
and O
xylose O
show O
a O
small O
peak O
in O
concentration O
within O
interaction O
zone O
1. O
These O
are O
both O
possible O
components O
of O
hemicellulose O
and O
S-methylcysteine; O
the O
latter O
is O
a O
possible O
precursor O
for O
alexine O
synthesis. O
Both O
compounds O
are O
increased O
in O
concentration O
in O
zone O
2, O
Arabinose O
and O
xylitol O
are O
most O
likely O
degradation O
products O
of O
R. O
solani O
induced O
cell O
wall O
lysis. O
Alternatively, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
downstream O
synthesis O
of O
hemi-cellulose O
is O
restrained, O
causing O
the O
accumulation O
of O
precursors O
components. O
Threonic O
acid O
and O
tartaric O
acid, O
decomposition O
products O
of O
ascorbate, O
increase O
in O
concentrations O
within O
zone O
2. O
Although O
ascorbate O
concentrations O
were O
not O
directly O
measured, O
it O
can O
be O
assumed, O
based O
on O
transcriptome O
data O
and O
the O
above O
mentioned O
results, O
that O
the O
ascorbate O
concentration O
is O
reduced, O
a O
status O
that O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
induction O
of O
senescence O
72 O
. O
Furthermore, O
vitamin O
C O
is O
an O
important O
anti-oxidative O
protecting O
agent O
against O
ROS O
and O
tartaric O
acid O
cannot O
be O
metabolised O
by O
fungi. O
Concluding O
remarks O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
inoculation O
of O
lettuce O
cv. O
Tizian O
with O
R. O
solani O
AG1-IB O
causes O
large-scale O
reprogramming O
of O
the O
transcriptome O
and O
metabolome O
in O
lettuce O
leaf O
tissue. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
role O
of O
lettuce O
in O
the O
interaction O
is O
not O
as O
passive O
as O
was O
previously O
assumed. O
Analysis O
of O
the O
metabolite O
profiles O
and O
the O
differentiated O
patterns O
of O
PRG O
transcript O
levels O
between O
the O
three O
interaction O
zones O
very O
much O
corroborates O
active O
defence O
efforts O
of O
lettuce. O

The O
majority O
of O
CLO/PXG-containing O
fungal O
genomes O
harbour O
a O
single O
gene O
copy O
but O
some O
genomes O
have O
two O
copies O
and O
a O
few O
have O
between O
three O
and O
five O
copies O
(see O
Additional O

Table O
S2). O
Similarly O
to O
the O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
in O
plant O
genomes O
[ O
4 O
], O
these O
multiple O
copies O
in O
fungal O
genomes O
have O
most O
probably O
arisen O
via O
tandem O
repeats O
of O
gene O
segments, O
or O
less O
likely O
via O
duplication O
events O
from O
a O
single O
original O
gene. O
This O
is O
supported O
by O
the O
monophyletic O
nature O
of O
the O
‘true’ O
Fungi, O
or O
Eumycota, O
which O
are O
a O
defined O
as O
a O
group O
of O
eukaryotic O
heterotrophs O
that O
reproduce O
with O
spores O
and O
have O
chitinous O
cell O
walls O
that O
probably O
diverged O
over O
one O
billion O
years O
ago O
[ O
75 O
, O
76 O
]. O
As O
shown O
in O
Table O
1 O
and O
Additional O
file O
3 O
: O
Table O
S3, O
the O
list O
of O
currently O
sequenced O
fungal O
genomes O
is O
heavily O
biased O
towards O
agriculturally O
and O
medically O
important O
species O
within O
the O
superphylum, O
Dikarya, O
which O
make O
up O
&gt; O
89% O
of O
the O
total O
lodged O
in O
public O
databases. O
Out O
of O
the O
755 O
sequenced O
genomes O
in O
the O
two O
Dikarya O
phyla, O
the O
Ascomycota O
and O
Basidiomycota, O
31 O
and O
27% O
of O
species O
respectively O
contain O
one O
or O
more O
well-supported O
CLO/PXG-like O
sequences. O
In O
contrast, O
only O
89 O
non-Dikarya O
species O
sequences O
were O
present O
in O
public O
databases. O
This O
is O
not O
because O
there O
are O
fewer O
species O
in O
the O
non-Dikarya O
but O
rather O
that O
they O
are O
generally O
less O
well O
studied O
and O
less O
likely O
to O
have O
significant O
economic O
impacts O
which O
means O
that O
fewer O
resources O
have O
been O
devoted O
to O
characterising O
their O
genomes. O
The O
non-Dikarya O
for O
which O
some O
sequence O
data O
are O
available O
include O
eight O
phyla O
ranging O
from O
the O
relatively O
advanced O
Mucoromycota O
to O
more O
basal O
taxa O
such O
as O
Chytridiomycota, O
Microsporidia O
and O
Cryptomycota O
where O
very O
few O
genomes O
have O
yet O
been O
sequenced. O

Therefore, O
the O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
assess O

On O
the O

Cyp1a2, O
Cyp3a25, O
Ugt1a6 O
and O

showed O
minimal O

they O
were O
down-regulated O

Conversely, O

returned O
toward O

Culley O
and O
colleagues O
in O
their O
neonatal O
model O
of O
RSV O
infection O
[ O
13 O
] O
demonstrated O
that O
RSV O
infection O
of O
young O
mice O
(0–14 O
d O
of O
age) O
produced O
more O
severe O
disease O
initially O
and O
upon O
subsequent O
rechallenge O
than O
did O
infection O
of O
adult O
mice. O
In O
fact, O
the O
younger O
the O
mouse O
upon O
initial O
RSV O
infection, O
the O
stronger O
the O
Th2 O
polarized O
immune O
response O
to O
RSV O
upon O
secondary O
infection. O
Furthermore, O
human O
data O
suggested O
a O
link O
between O
RSV O
lower O
respiratory O
tract O
infections O
in O
infancy O
and O
the O
later O
development O
of O
asthma O
[ O
5 O
– O
10 O
]. O
Thus, O
we O
were O
expecting O
to O
see O
pulmonary O
changes O
in O
weanling O
mice O
(21 O
d O
of O
age) O
exposed O
to O
RSV O
alone O
(RSS). O
However, O
we O
failed O
to O
see O
any O
pathophysiological O
response O
to O
RSV O
alone O
(RSS O
and O
SSR) O
or O
to O
weanling O
exposure O
to O
RSV O
followed O
by O
allergen O
(ROO). O
Although O
this O
data O
was O
unexpected, O
we O
feel O
that O
it O
further O
supports O
Culley's O
original O
work[ O
13 O
] O
and O
the O
more O
recent O
work O
of O
Dakhama O
and O
colleagues[ O
14 O
] O
demonstrating O
the O
importance O
of O
timing O
of O
the O
initial O
exposure O
to O
RSV. O
Although O
not O
presented O
here, O
we O
have O
preliminary O
data O
suggesting O
that O
earlier O
infection O
with O
RSV O
during O
neonatal O
development O
(7 O
d O
of O
age) O
is O
sufficient O
to O
induce O
long-term O
functional O
consequences O
in O
the O
mouse O
even O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
allergic O
inflammation. O
In O
summary, O
the O
age O
of O
primary O
RSV O
infection O
has O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
determining O
disease O
outcome O
and O
suggests O
that O
immunity O
in O
weanling O
mice O
may O
have O
matured O
beyond O
the O
polarized O
Th2 O
responses O
of O
the O
neonate. O
Histological O
analyses O
of O
weanling O
mice O
first O
exposed O
to O
Ova O
and O
then O
infected O
with O
RSV O
(OOR O
group) O
revealed O
changes O
consistent O
with O
airway O
remodeling O
including O
subepithelial O
fibrosis, O
collagen O
deposition, O
smooth O
muscle O
hypertrophy, O
and O
mucus O
cell O
hyperplasia. O
Histological O
changes O
observed O
in O
the O
ROO O
group O
were O
similar O
to O
mice O
receiving O
Ova O
alone O
(OVA O
group). O

To O
overcome O
this O
limitation, O
a O
more O
robust O
phylogenetic O
relationship O
framework O
for O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
was O
developed O
by O
comparing O
the O
sequences O
of O
genes O
coding O
for O
proteins O
with O
conserved O
function O
(Sergeant O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
An O
and O
Grewal O
2010 O
; O
Lee O
and O
Stock O
2010a O
). O
Finally, O
multilocus O
sequence O
analysis O
(MLSA) O
of O
genes O
coding O
for O
proteins O
with O
conserved O
functions, O
called O
housekeeping O
genes, O
was O
widely O
adopted O
for O
inference O
of O
the O
phylogenetic O
relationships O
of O
nematode O
microsymbionts O
and O
gradually O
replaced O
the O
single-gene O
analysis O
and O
time-consuming O
DDH O
in O
identification O
and O
classification O
of O
these O
bacteria O
(Maiden O

1998 O
; O
Stackebrandt O
et O
al. O
2002 O
; O
Glaeser O
and O
Kämpfer O
2015 O
). O
Nevertheless, O
the O
16S O
rDNA O
sequence O
analysis O
is O
still O
a O
common O
approach O
for O
preliminary O
investigations O
of O
the O

for O

(glutamyl-tRNA O

for O
a O

the O

introduced O
the O
scheme O

Hence, O
the O
Xenorhbdus O

was O
outlined O
as O
a O
collection O

strains O
whose O
concatenated O
sequences O
of O
the O

mentioned O
above O
(3396 O

showed O
97% O

of O

growing O

revealed O
the O

. O
However, O
the O
functional O
characterization O
of O
many O
remains O
incomplete. O
Here, O
we O
present O
the O
characterization O
of O
a O
sRNA O
termed O
RssR O
that O
is O
involved O
in O
the O

Proteins O

were O
IP O
with O
IκBɛ O
antibody O
and O
immunoblotted O
as O
indicated. O
Representative O
of O
two O
repeats. O
To O
address O
REGγ-dependent O
degradation O
of O
IκBɛ O
in O
more O
detail, O
we O
performed O
cell O
fractionation O
experiments O
to O
understand O
where O
the O
REGγ-proteasome O
primarily O
degrades O
IκBɛ. O
Our O
data O
showed O
some O
accumulation O
of O
IκBɛ O
in O
the O
nuclear O
fractions O
from O
REGγ O
−/− O
colon O
epithelial O
cells O
( O
Fig. O

), O
suggesting O
that O
IκBɛ O
maybe O
mainly O
degraded O
in O
the O
compartment O
where O
REGγ O
is O
mostly O
localized. O
Less O
difference O
of O
IκBɛ O
in O
cytosol O
was O
probably O
due O
to O
activation O
of O
NFκB O
and O
ubiquitin-dependent O
degradation O
of O
IκBɛ. O
Moreover, O
we O
analysed O
molecular O
interactions O
between O
REGγ O
and O
IκBs O
by O
co-immunoprecipitation. O
We O
found O
that O
only O
IκBɛ, O
but O
not O
IκBα O
or O
IκBβ, O
could O
be O
immunoprecipitated O
(IP) O
by O
GST-REGγ O
( O
Fig. O
5f O
). O
To O
determine O
the O
recognition O
specificity O
by O
REGγ, O
we O
analysed O
amino O
acid O
sequences O
among O
the O
three O
IκBs O
( O
Supplementary O
Table O
2 O
). O
It O
appears O
that O
the O
major O
differences O
among O
these O
IκBs O
are O
within O
the O
N-terminal O
60 O
amino O
acids. O
We O
generated O
an O
IκBɛ O
construct O
with O
deletion O
of O
the O
N-terminal O
60 O
amino O
acids O
(GST-IκBɛΔN60). O
GST O

using O
the O

suggested O
the O

of O

to O
IκBɛ O
via O

N-terminus O
( O

Mice O
infected O
with O
wild-type O
CO92 O
produced O
large O
lobar O
pulmonary O
lesions O
throughout O
the O
lungs, O
whereas O
the O
lungs O
of O
Pestoides O
F-infected O
mice O
showed O
smaller, O
more O
nodular O

lesions, O
similar O
in O
size O
and O
distribution O
to O
that O
of O
the O
Δpla O
CO92 O
( O
Fig. O

). O
We O
then O
performed O
flow O

to O
quantitate O
the O
observed O

the O

and O
to O
determine O
the O

CO92-infected O

showed O
a O
massive O

in O

of O

the O
primary O

recruited O
to O
the O
lungs O
is O
the O
neutrophil O
( O
Fig. O

; O
Supplementary O
Fig. O

). O
In O
contrast, O
mice O
infected O
with O
Pestoides O
F O
or O
the O
isogenic O
Δpla O
CO92 O
mutant O
do O
not O
respond O
with O
this O
influx O
of O
immune O
cells O
to O
the O
lungs O
( O
Fig. O
2d O
; O
Supplementary O
Fig. O
2 O
). O
Furthermore, O
an O
examination O
of O
the O
pulmonary O
inflammatory O
cytokine O
response O
reveals O
that, O
unlike O
CO92, O
which O
stimulates O
a O
robust O
release O
of O
multiple O
inflammatory O
cytokines O
into O
the O
airspace, O
mice O
infected O
with O
Pestoides O
F O
or O
the O
Δpla O
CO92 O
mutant O
exhibit O
a O
severely O
dampened O
response O
with O
significantly O
lower O
cytokine O
levels O
( O
Fig. O
2e O
). O
Thus, O
our O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
ancestral O
Pestoides O
F O
strain O
is O
unable O
to O
cause O
primary O
pneumonic O
plague O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
is O
highly O
similar O
to O
a O
Δpla O
mutant O
of O
CO92. O
Pestoides O
F O
is O
competent O
to O
produce O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
similarities O
of O
the O
respiratory O
infection O
between O
Pestoides O
F O
and O
CO92 O
Δpla, O
we O
asked O
whether O
the O
acquisition O
of O
pPCP1 O
(and O
specifically O
Pla) O
was O
sufficient O
for O
this O
ancestral O
Y. O
pestis O
strain O
to O
cause O
primary O
pneumonic O
plague. O
However, O
it O
is O
not O
yet O
known O
whether O
Pestoides O
F O
is O
able O
to O
stably O
harbour O

The O

the O

Both O

in O

mushrooms O
were O
valued O
as O
a O

It O
was O

According O
to O
Ruan-Soto O

( O

these O
are O
indicators O
of O
mycophilia. O
Linking O
mushrooms O

the O

is O
common O
in O
Mexico O
(Garibay-Orijel O

and O
in O
some O

countries O
such O
as O
Ethiopia O
(Abate O

In O
the O
region O
studied, O
mushrooms O
were O
considered O
akin O
to O
tender O
meat O
due O
to O
their O
consistency O
but O
to O
have O
a O

was O
in O

with O
Kim O

[ O

] O
but O
varied O
from O
the O
one O
reported O
by O
Randi O
et O
al. O
[ O
23 O
]. O
It O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
we O
used O
non-linear O
regression O
to O
analyze O
the O
kinetics O
while O
the O
two O
cited O
studies O
used O
Lineweaver-Burk O

a O
method O

[ O

We O
noted O
the O

of O
the O

in O
good O
amounts O
in O
a O
commercial O
preparation O
of O
a O
secreted O
lipase O
of O
R. O
arrhizus O
(Fig. O

Interestingly, O
in O
an O
earlier O
study, O
the O
authors O
have O
indicated O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
“soluble O
factor” O
in O

arrhizus O
extract O
that O
can O
activate O
caspase, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
identify O
this O
factor O
[ O

]. O
Based O
on O
these O
observations, O
we O
tried O
to O
verify O
whether O
this O
unknown O
water-soluble O
factor O
could O
be O
cyt O
c O
present O
in O
the O
supernatant O
of O
the O
R. O

cultures O
or O
not. O
Efforts O
to O
locate O
the O
cyt O

fractions O
with O
heme O
staining O
(data O
not O

and O
using O
an O
antibody O
against O
cyt O
c O
were O
not O
successful O
(Additional O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
under O
our O
test O
conditions, O
the O
protein O
is O
not O
secreted O
into O
the O
supernatant. O
However, O
the O
possibilities O
that O
the O
protein O
might O
be O
secreted O
in O

to O
some O
special O
cue, O
or O
in O

could O
not O
be O
ruled O
out. O

Host O
cytokines O
as O

Another O
potential O
mechanism O
by O
which O
gut O
bacteria O
could O
modulate O
systemic O
immune O
responses O
is O
through O
local O
induction O
of O
soluble O
immunomodulatory O
factors O
that O
then O
disseminate O
systemically. O
Circulating O
cytokines O
may O
shift O
the O
activation O
threshold O
of O
key O
immune O
subsets O
within O
the O
TME O
or O
TdLN, O
thus O
leading O
to O
augmented O
adaptive O
immune O
responses O
in O
the O
context O
of O

Candidate O
mechanisms O
include O
increased O
production O
of O
type O
I O
interferons, O
IL-12 O
and O
TNFα, O
or O
decreased O
production O
of O
immune O
suppressive O
cytokines O
such O
as O
IL-10 O
and O
TGF-β. O
As O
an O
example, O
segmented O
filamentous O
bacteria O
can O
induce O
secretion O
of O
IL-22 O
from O
type O
3 O
innate O
lymphoid O
cells O
in O
mice, O
causing O
production O
of O
serum O
amyloid O
A O
in O
the O

which, O
in O

acts O
on O
the O
LP O

the O

in O
an O
IL-12–dependent O

Immune O
cells O
as O
messengers O
A O
recurring O
theme O
in O
many O
of O
the O
described O
mechanistic O
studies O
is O
that O
innate O
immune O
cells, O
often O
DCs, O
represent O
the O
central O
cell O
type O
affected O
by O
perturbations O
within O
the O

community O
[ O

, O
18 O
, O
85 O
, O
86 O
, O

, O

]. O
DCs O
are O
key O
microbial O
sensors O
that O
bridge O
innate O
to O
adaptive O
immunity O
and O
are O
also O
critical O
for O
molding O
T O
cell O
responses O
within O
the O
TME. O
Microbial O
signals O
might O
only O
need O
to O
function O
locally O
in O
the O
LP O
and O
MLN O
to O
drive O
DC O
function O
and O
the O
subsequent O
delivery O
of O
the O
immunomodulatory O
effect O
to O
the O
TME O
might O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
DCs O
themselves O
or O
downstream O
by O
T O
cells. O
Various O
innate O
immune O
cells O
have O
been O
shown O
capable O
of O
exiting O
the O
intestinal O
LP O
and O
translocating O
to O
the O
spleen O
and O
peripheral O
lymph O

under O
steady O
state O
[ O

Different O
mechanisms O

be O
in O

in O
the O
context O

These O

established O
the O
importance O

Results O
from O
multiple O

Distinct O
bacterial O

whereas O
other O

Importantly, O
only O
some O
of O
these O

consistent O
across O
multiple O
studies. O
This O
discrepancy O
may O
reflect O
discordant O
biology—the O
patient O
populations O
were O
from O
geographically O
distinct O
locations, O
with O
potentially O
dissimilar O
environmental O
and O
genetic O
factors—but O
also O
may O
be O
explained O
by O
technical O
differences, O
such O
as O

Mirroring O

the O

is O
Loop-mediated O
amplification O
(LAMP) O
first O
described O
over O
a O

The O
LAMP O
reaction O
utilises O

LAMP O
amplification O
has O
been O
used O
for O

due O

The O

also O
mean O
that O
non-specific O

an O

The O

the O

Recent O

it O
is O

that O

Altogether, O
oral O

caused O
severe O

We O
speculate O
that O
the O
cause O

not O

Instead, O
one O

Megasphaera O
is O
a O

on O
the O

through O

(SCFAs) O
production O
[ O

In O
the O

were O
shown O
to O
inhibit O
cytokine O

inflammation O
after O

[ O

Trompette O

also O
showed O
that O
bacterial O
SCFAs O
reduce O
neutrophil O
recruitment O
to O
the O

and O
protect O
against O
influenza O

infection O
in O

suggesting O
that O
it O
has O
anti-inflammatory O

[ O

Cait O

demonstrated O
that O

ameliorate O

suggesting O
its O
anti-inflammatory O

in O
the O

[ O

One O
study O
on O

microbiome O
of O
H7N9-infected O
patients O
showed O
that O
Megasphaera O
increased O
in O
patients O

secondary O
bacterial O
infection, O
suggesting O
its O
potential O
role O
in O
preventing O

Further O
validation O
on O
the O
identity O
and O
prevalence O
of O
these O
genera O
is O
warranted O
to O
explore O
their O
functions O

Our O
study O
provides O
novel O
insights O
on O
the O
impact O
of O
smoking O
on O
the O
lung O
microbiome, O
although O
individual O
subgroups O
had O
small O
sample O
sizes O
and O
the O
results O
need O
further O
confirmation O
in O
larger O
cohorts. O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
effect O
of O
current O
smoking O
on O
the O
lung O
microbiome O
differs O
between O
healthy O
subjects O
and O
COPD O
patients. O
In O
healthy O
subjects, O
a O
significantly O
increased O
Haemophilus O
was O
observed O
in O
smokers O
versus O
non-smokers, O
suggesting O
that O
smoking O
could O
be O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
airway O
dysbiosis O
in O
healthy O
populations. O
In O
COPD O
patients, O
a O
significantly O
increased O
Haemophilus O
was O
observed O
in O
ex-smokers O
versus O
current O
smokers. O
The O
greater O
dysbiosis O
in O
COPD O
ex-smokers O
was O
further O
associated O
with O
their O
greater O
airway O
inflammatory O
states, O
as O
evident O
by O
significantly O
higher O
expression O
of O
sputum O
pro-inflammatory O
markers. O
Our O
findings O
further O
support O
the O
view O
that O
smoking O
likely O
had O
resulted O
in O
an O
irreversible O
airway O
inflammation O
in O
COPD, O
which O
persisted O
despite O
smoking O
cessation O
[ O

Moreover, O
Lnc34a O
promotes O
HCC O
cellular O
proliferation, O
migration, O
and O
invasion O
in O

and O
the O
knockdown O
of O
Lnc34a O
could O
inhibit O
BM O
of O
HCC O
in O

Furthermore, O
Lnc34a O
was O
found O
to O
epigenetically O
silence O
miR-34a O
expression O
via O
the O
binding O
of O
its O
promoter O
to O
HDAC1 O
and O
DNMT3a, O
which O
was O
recruited O
through O
PHB2. O
In O
addition, O
miR-34a O
has O
been O
documented O
to O
inhibit O
cancer O
development O
in O
many O
solid O
tumors, O
including O
breast, O
skin, O
and O
prostate O
cancer O
[ O
23 O
– O
25 O
]. O
Consistent O
with O
these O
previous O
reports, O
we O
observed O
miR-34a O
to O
act O
as O
a O
tumor O
suppressor O
in O
HCC. O
The O
low O
levels O
of O
miR-34a O
in O
the O
intratumoral O
tissue O
were O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
incidence O
of O
BM O
in O
HCC O
patients. O
Moreover, O
miR-34a O
was O
found O
to O
decrease O
HCC O
cell O
proliferation, O
migration, O
and O
invasion O
in O
vitro O
and O
inhibit O
BM O
in O
vivo. O
Previous O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
miR-34a O
is O
involved O
in O
various O
pathophysiological O
processes O
through O
the O
TGF-β O
pathway O
in O
several O
cancers O
[ O
25 O
– O
28 O
]. O
For O
instance, O
in O
HCC O
patients, O
elevated O
TGF-β O
activity O
associated O
with O
the O
persistent O
presence O
of O
hepatitis O
B O
virus O
(HBV) O
in O
the O
liver O
tissue, O
and O
was O
shown O
to O
downregulate O
miR-34a O
expression; O
this O
led O
to O
the O
enhanced O
production O
of O
the O
chemokine O
CCL22, O
which O
recruited O
regulatory O
T O
cells O
to O
facilitate O
immune O
escape. O
Therefore, O
HBV O
infection O
and O
activation O
of O
the O
TGF-β-miR-34a-CCL22 O
axis O
facilitates O
portal O
vein O
tumor O
thrombus O
development O
of O
HBV-positive O
HCC O
through O
the O
creation O
of O
an O
immune-subversive O
microenvironment O
[ O
25 O
]. O
Moreover, O
miR-34a O
mediates O
the O
resistance O
of O
oxaliplatin O
in O
colorectal O
cancer O
cells O
by O
inhibiting O
macroautophagy O
via O
the O
TGF-β/Smad4 O
pathway O
[ O

Considering O
the O
results O
of O
this O
study, O
it O
may O
be O
clinically O
helpful O
to O
advice O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
on O
the O
benefits O
of O
physical O
activity, O
especially O
regular O
walking. O
There O
is O
no O
previous O
study O
that O
explores O
the O
association O
between O
the O
regular O
walking O
and O
periodontal O
heath O
inequalities. O
The O
results O
of O
this O
study O
suggest O
that O
promoting O
regular O
walking O
can O
promote O
oral O
health. O
However, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
because O
causal O
relationships O
between O
regular O
walking O
and O
periodontal O
health O
could O
not O
be O
discussed O
in O
this O
study. O
This O
would O
be O
useful O
for O
establishing O
a O
guideline O
for O
decreasing O
health O
inequalities O
with O
regard O
to O
periodontitis. O
The O
following O
are O
the O
limitations O
of O
this O
study. O
Firstly, O
it O
had O
a O
cross-sectional O
design O
which O
does O
not O
allow O
determining O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
causal O
relationship O
between O
regular O
walking O
and O
periodontitis. O
Further O
studies O
that O
adopt O
a O
prospective O
design O
are O
needed O
for O
the O
same. O
Longitudinal O
studies O
should O
be O
done O
to O
verify O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
direct O
role O
of O
physical O
activity O
in O
preventing O
periodontitis O
and O
to O
determine O
its O
interactions O
with O
other O
factors O
that O
are O
known O
to O
affect O
periodontitis. O
Secondly, O
this O
survey O
was O
limited O
to O
Koreans O
and O
can O
hinder O
the O
generalization O
of O
the O
results. O
Thirdly, O
since O
the O
study O
was O
based O
on O
self-reported O
health O
status O
and O
physical O
activity, O
there O
might O
have O
been O
bias. O
Finally, O
since O
periodontitis O
was O
evaluated O
using O
the O
CPI, O
periodontitis O
could O
be O
over- O
or O
underestimated O
44 O
. O
Generally, O
periodontal O
statuses O
are O
assessed O
by O
using O
clinical O
attachment O
level O
and O
pocket O
depth. O
However, O
CPI O
is O
an O
epidemiologic O
tool O
developed O
by O
WHO. O
The O
measurement O
of O
regular O
walking O
in O
the O
KNHANES O
data O
was O
based O
on O
IPAQ O
that O
has O
been O
widely O
used O
and O
has O
acceptable O
validity. O
Moreover, O
the O
data O
covers O
a O
large O
number O
of O
subjects, O
and O
the O
complex O
sampling O
design O
was O
considered O
during O
all O
analyses O
to O
overcome O
shortcomings. O
Walking O
is O
a O
simple, O
safe, O
and O
cost-effective O
health O
behaviour O
that O
can O
reduce O
the O
prevalence O
of O
chronic O
diseases O
and O
reduce O
the O
cost O
of O
health O
care O
45 O
– O
47 O
. O
Our O
study O
supported O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
regular O
walking O
is O
associated O
to O
lower O
prevalence O
of O
periodontitis. O

Fundamental O

the O
tick O
life-cycle O

of O
the O

they O

[ O

]. O
The O
distribution O
and O

of O

pathogens O
often O
depends O
on O
distribution O
of O

not O
just O
distribution O

the O

and O
such O
insight O
provides O
another O

Anaplasma B-PATH
phagocytophilum I-PATH
is O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
human O
granulocytic O
anaplasmosis O
[ O

], O
and O
it O
also O
causes O
disease O
and O
economic O
losses O
in O
livestock O
[ O

]. O
Tick-borne O
fever, O
caused O
by O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
is O
considered O
a O
major O
problem O
for O
livestock O
production. O
Anaplasmosis O
leads O
to O
mortality O
and O
especially O
lambs O
are O
at O
risk O
[ O

]. O
Infection O
with O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
also O
reduces O
body O
growth O
of O
lambs O
[ O

Some O
tick-borne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Borrelia O
burgdorferi O
(sensu O
lato) O
and O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
have O
a O
high O
genetic O
diversity. O
Due O
to O
the O
high O
genetic O
diversity, O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
was O
formerly O
even O
split O
in O
three O
different O
species O
[ O
12 O
]. O
This O
genetic O
diversity O
has O
probably O
arisen O
as O
a O
response O
to O
evasion O
of O
immune O
defenses O
of O
phylogenetically O

Elucidating O
the O
presence O
of O

A. B-PATH

which O

Although O
not O
presented O
here, O
we O
have O
preliminary O
data O
suggesting O
that O
earlier O
infection O
with O
RSV O
during O
neonatal O
development O
(7 O
d O
of O
age) O
is O
sufficient O
to O
induce O
long-term O
functional O
consequences O
in O
the O
mouse O
even O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
allergic O
inflammation. O
In O
summary, O
the O
age O
of O
primary O
RSV O
infection O
has O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
determining O
disease O
outcome O
and O
suggests O
that O
immunity O
in O
weanling O
mice O
may O
have O
matured O
beyond O
the O
polarized O
Th2 O
responses O
of O
the O
neonate. O
Histological O
analyses O
of O
weanling O
mice O
first O
exposed O
to O
Ova O
and O
then O
infected O
with O
RSV O
(OOR O
group) O
revealed O
changes O
consistent O
with O
airway O
remodeling O
including O
subepithelial O
fibrosis, O
collagen O
deposition, O
smooth O
muscle O
hypertrophy, O
and O
mucus O
cell O
hyperplasia. O
Histological O
changes O
observed O
in O
the O
ROO O
group O
were O
similar O
to O
mice O
receiving O
Ova O
alone O
(OVA O
group). O
The O
amount O
of O
airway O
remodeling O
observed O
was O
positively O
correlated O
with O
increased O
airway O
hyperresponsiveness O
to O
aerosolized O
MeCh O
and O
with O
macrophage/eosinophil O
ratios O
in O
the O
OVA O
and O
OOR O
groups. O
Our O
data O
(presented O
here O
and O
elsewhere[ O
20 O
]) O
along O
with O
the O
data O
of O
others[ O
26 O
] O
suggest O
that O
eosinophils O
play O
a O
prominent O
role O
in O
orchestrating O
the O
local O
pulmonary O
immune O
responses O
and O
pathologies O
associated O
with O
allergic O
inflammation O
(i.e., O
asthma). O
It O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
if O
the O
specific O
loss O
of O
eosinophils O
leads O
to O
improvement O
of O
pulmonary O
function O
parameters O
and O
pathologies O
associated O
with O
neonatal O
RSV O
infection. O
Analysis O
of O
cytokine O
data O
demonstrated O
elevations O
in O
both O
Th2 O
and O
Th1 O
cytokines. O
Previous O
studies O
have O
clearly O
demonstrated O
that O
TNF-α O
contributes O
to O
early O
clearance O
of O
RSV O
[ O
27 O
]; O
however, O
continued O
production O
of O
TNF-α O
exacerbates O
RSV-induced O
illness O
[ O
28 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
neutralization O
of O
TNF-α O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
clinical O
illness O
without O
an O
impairment O
on O
viral O
clearance[ O
29 O
]. O
Interestingly, O
the O
OOR O
group O
exhibited O
greater O
than O
10 O
times O
the O
amount O
of O
TNF-α O
observed O
in O
any O
other O
group. O

intimate O
association O
between O
the O
springtail O
and O
the O
soil O
ecosystem. O
The O
presence O
of O
ARGs O
in O
the O
gut O
of O
Folsomia O
may O
have O
ecological O
relevance. O
It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
we O
identified O
a O
substantial O
number O
of O
β-lactamases, O
probably O
resulting O
from O
the O
selective O
pressure O
caused O
by O
β O
-lactam O
production O
by O
the O
host O
itself O
12 O
. O
For O
example, O
Bacillus O
toyonensis, O
a O
member O
of O
F. O
candida’s O
microbiota, O
is O
highly O
resistant O
to O
β-lactams O
77 O
. O
Furthermore, O
interactions O
between O
bacterial O
communities O
with O
antibiotic O
biosynthesis O
capacity O
and O
communities O
showing O
resistance O
to O
such O
antibiotics O
can O
also O
be O
expected. O
Observations O
from O
this O
and O
other O
studies O
indicate O
a O
potential O
for O
Pseudomonas, O
Streptomyces O
and O
Gordonia O
strains O
isolated O
from O
F. O
candida O
to O
synthesize O
antibiotics O
(see O
section O
above, O
Supplementary O
File O
3 O
and O
18 O
), O
while O
Streptomyces, O
Enterococcus O
and O
Staphylococcus O
are O
abundant O
among O
ARG-containing O
bacterial O
strains O
in O
Folsomia’s O
gut O
(Supplementary O
File O
4 O
). O
This O
supports O
the O
notion O
that O
antibiotics O
regulate O
the O
homeostasis O
of O
microbial O
communities, O
and O
may O
even O
be O
beneficial O
for O
commensal O
bacteria O
in O
environments O
such O
as O
the O
animal O
gut O
78 O
. O
Finally, O
Engel O
&amp; O
Moran O
1 O
suggested O
that O
this O
balance O
may O
be O
important O
in O
facilitating O
colonization O
resistance O
against O
parasites O
and O
bacteria O
pathogenic O
to O
the O
host. O
The O
data O
provided O
in O
this O
study O
will O
be O
highly O
relevant O
in O
formulating O
concrete O
hypotheses O
to O
investigate O
the O
ecological O
connectivity O
of O
antibiotic-biosynthetic O
and O

in O

Human O
universals O
(Brown O
1991 O
, O

) O
may O
only O
be O
uncovered O
following O
assessment O
of O
multiple O
human O
populations, O
if O
not O
all O
populations, O
and O
assist O
in O
developing O
and O
evaluating O
evolutionary O
theories O
of O
behaviour. O
If O
we O
are O
to O
test O
how O
individual O
differences O
may O
be O
functionally O
adaptive O
(Tybur O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Wilson O
1998 O
), O
we O
need O
to O
compare O
individuals O
from O
different O
ecological O
settings O
(Nettle O
2009 O
). O
An O
awareness O
of O
the O
diversity O
of O
worldwide O
human O
behaviours O
would O
help O
us O
understand O
how O
human O
behaviours O
emerge O
from O
an O
interaction O
between O
local O
ecologies O
and O
our O
evolved O
brains O
(Henrich O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
For O
these O
sorts O
of O
reasons, O
classic O
studies O
that O
seek O
to O
test O
adaptive O
reasoning O
have O
taken O
pains O
to O
survey O
different O
populations O
(e.g. O
Buss O
1989 O
; O
Daly O

Wilson O
1988 O
; O

1992 O

Schaller O

2008 O
; O
Schmitt O

; O
Scott O

Reliance O
on O
WEIRD O
populations O
limits O
discovery O
of O
any O
patterns O
that O
might O
allow O
us O
to O
predict O
domains O
where O
psychological O
phenomena O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
universal, O
and O
domains O
where O
psychological O
phenomena O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
show O
variability O
(Henrich O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
As O
an O
additional O
step, O
WEIRD O
authors O
(including O
ourselves) O
could O
usefully O
reach O
out O
to O
non-WEIRD O
collaborators O
to O
attempt O
to O
draw O
from O
wider O

Encouraging O
greater O
diversity O
among O
authors O
should O
automatically O
increase O
participant O

(Medin O

2017 O
). O
Henrich O
et O
al.’s O
( O
2010 O
) O
renowned O
position O
piece O
explains O
that O
participants O
from O
WEIRD O
(Western, O
Educated, O
Industrialised, O
Rich, O
Democratic) O
populations O
can O
be O
more O
or O
less O
universally O
representative, O
dependent O
upon O
the O
area O
of O
research, O
and O
goes O
on O
to O
detail O
where O
reliance O
on O
WEIRD O

might O
not O
present O

To O
summarise O
Henrich O

findings O
in O

far O
as O
they O
are O
of O
particular O

to O

that O

Although O

this O

It O

A O
recent O

reported O
that O
the O
rate O
of O
resistance O
in O
the O
group O
of O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
bacteremia O
was O
between O
those O
groups O
of O
nosocomial O
and O
CA O
bacteremia O
[ O
28 O
]. O
This O
discrepancy O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
different O
infection O
types O
of O
the O
population O
studied, O
or O
the O
regional O
differences O
of O
resistance O
characteristics O
in O
K. O
pneumoniae. O
In O
our O
study, O
29.7% O
of O
the O
HCA O
isolates O
were O
carbapenem O
resistant, O
35.9% O
expressed O
ESBL, O
and O
52.3% O
were O
MDR, O
indicating O
the O
severe O
drug O
resistance O
in O
isolates O
from O
the O
HCA O
infections. O
The O
high O
degree O
of O
antibiotic O
resistance O
in O
HCA O
strains O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
frequent O
contact O
with O
healthcare O
facilities O
among O
HCA O
patients, O
where O
the O
drug-resistant O
bacteria O
could O
spread. O
In O
addition, O
other O
factors O
such O
as O
overuse O
of O
antibiotics O
might O
also O
responsible O
for O
developing O
antimicrobial O
resistance. O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
increased O
attention O
should O
be O
paid O
to O
the O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections. O
The O
spread O
of O
CRKP O
strains O
has O
become O
a O
new O
public O
health O
crisis O
worldwide. O
Published O
studies O
on O
the O
distribution O
of O
CRKP O
isolates O
among O
nosocomial, O
HCA, O
and O
CA O
infections O
are O
scarce. O
The O
present O
study O
showed O
that O
CRKP O
strains O
were O
rare O
in O
the O
CA O
group, O
but O
more O
prevalent O
in O
both O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
groups. O
Thus, O
it O
should O
be O
of O
caution O
when O
use O
carbapenems O
to O
treat O
patients O
with O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
infections. O
In O
agreement O
with O
other O
studies, O
the O
bla O
KPC O
was O
the O
dominant O
carbapenemase O
gene O
carried O
by O
CRKP O
strains O
[ O
18 O
, O
29 O
]. O
In O
this O
investigation, O
only O
12 O
and O
3 O
CRKP O
strains O
harbored O
bla O
NDM O
and O
bla O
OXA-48-like O
genes O
respectively. O
Indeed, O
the O
bla O
OXA-48-like O
producers O
were O
more O
prevalent O
in O
western O
countries O
such O
as O
France, O
Spain O
and O
Germany, O
but O
were O
rare O
in O
China O
[ O
30 O
– O
32 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
bla O
genes O
screened O
were O
absent O
in O
five O
CRKP O
isolates. O

Such O
that O
there O
was O
no O
HCV O
detected O
in O
Iranian O
hemophilia O
patients O
born O
in O
Shiraz O
from O
2001 O
to O
2010 O
20 O
. O
The O
anti-HCV O
prevalence O
in O
Pakistanis O
hemophilia O
also O
varies O
from O
25% O
in O
children O
in O
Peshawar O
21 O
to O
56% O
in O
Lahore O
22 O
. O
So, O
the O
prevalence O
rate O
of O
HCV O
among O
Afghanistan O
hemophilia O
patients O
in O
this O
study O
seems O
to O
be O
much O
lower O
(8.75%). O
The O
low O
prevalence O
rate O
of O
HCV O
in O
this O
study O
in O
comparison O
with O
Iran O
and O
Pakistan O
might O
be O
in O
view O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
average O
age O
of O
the O
participants O
was O
low O
(with O
the O
mean O
age O
of O
13.66). O
Since O
in O
1980–1990, O
plasma-derived O
factor O
replacement O
products O
were O
contaminated O
by O
HIV O
and O
HCV, O
we O
expect O
older O
people O
to O
be O
more O
infected O
23 O
. O
All O
HCV O
seropositive O
patients O
except O
for O
one O
(who O
was O
a O
2-year-old O
child O
with O
blood O
transfusion O
record) O
were O
over O
25 O
years O
old. O
So, O
conduct O
of O
a O
nationally-representative O
population-based O
survey O
and O
mandatory O
anti-HCV O
screening O
in O
blood O
banks O
is O
recommended O
to O
provide O
a O
better O
estimate O
of O
HCV O
prevalence. O
All O
hemophilic O
patients O
in O
this O
study O
escaped O
HIV O
infection. O
This O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
hemophilia O
population O
in O
Pakistan O
12 O
, O
24 O
and O
most O
cities O
in O
Iran O
14 O
, O
16 O
. O
Low O
seropositivity O
of O
HIV O
in O
these O
populations O
could O
be O
as O
a O
result O
of O
screening O
of O
donated O
blood O
units O
since O
1990 O
20 O
. O
HTLV-1, O
the O
first O
retrovirus O
identified O
in O
human, O
is O
also O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
hematologic O
disorders. O
Basically, O
HTLV-1 O
has O
a O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
blood O
disorders O
than O
the O
general O
population O
25 O
. O
So O
All O
hemophilic O
patient O
in O
this O
study O
were O
investigated O
for O
presence O
of O
HTLV-1 O
which O
was O
all O
negative. O

We O
found O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
parvovirus O
B19 O
and O
low O
prevalence O
of O
HBV, O
HCV, O
HIV, O
and O
HTLV-1 O
among O
hemophilia O
patients O
in O
Afghanistan. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
study O
investigating O
five O
blood-borne O
viruses O
in O
hemophilia O
patients O
in O
Afghanistan. O
Further O
studies O
enrolling O
a O

between O
species O
that O
have O
lost O
them O
versus O
those O
that O
have O
retained O
them, O
possibly O
for O
as O
much O
as O
one O
billion O
years? O
We O
describe O
above O
new O
evidence O
that O
we O
have O
presented O
for O
some O
specific O
functions O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
that O
are O
related O
to O
processes O
involving O
oxylipin O
signalling, O
LD O
metabolism, O
and O
aflatoxicogenicity. O
However, O
it O
is O
also O
important O
to O
look O
more O
broadly O
at O
other O
possible O
functions O
of O
these O
genes, O
especially O
in O
the O
light O
of O
their O
apparent O
loss O
in O
so O
many O
fungal O
groups. O
In O
this O
regard, O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
discern O
any O
systematic O
differences O
between O
those O
fungal O
species O
that O
lack O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
versus O
those O
that O
have O
retained O
them. O
For O
example, O
when O
the O
economically O
important O
genera, O
Aspergillus O
(where O
30/54 O
genomes O
contain O
CLO/PXG O
genes), O
Penicillium O
(7 O
out O
of O
28 O
genomes) O
and O
Colletotrichum O
(13 O
out O
of O
20 O
genomes), O
are O
examined O
in O
more O
detail O
(see O
Additional O

Table O
S2) O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
some O
highly O
pathogenic O
species O
contain O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
while O
other O
closely O
related O
and O
similarly O
pathogenic O
species O
lack O
these O
genes. O

The O

pathways O
were O
the O
most O

up-regulated O

in O
both O

While O

ABA O
tends O
to O
be O
a O
negative O
regulator O
of O
resistance O
to O

25 O
, O
68 O
– O
70 O
. O
ABA O
is O
also O
important O
to O
inter-kingdom O
signaling O
among O
pathogens O
and O
plants. O
For O
example, O
synthesis O
of O
ABA O
by O
the O
fungal O
pathogen O
M. O
oryzae O
during O
interactions O
with O
rice O
is O
necessary O
for O
pathogen O

ABA O
promotes O
rice O
susceptibility O

the O
bacterial O
pathogen O

(Xoo) O
and O
even O
induces O
swimming O
in O
the O
bacteria O
26 O
, O
72 O
. O
While O
our O
results O
show O
that O
both O
ABA O
and O
SA O
are O
induced O
during O
response O
to O
biotic O
stress, O
ABA-induced O
susceptibility O
to O
Xoo O
is O
due O
to O
ABA O
suppressing O
SA-mediated O
defense O
26 O
. O
We O
previously O
hypothesized O
that O
ABA O
is O
a O
node O
of O
cross-talk O
in O
the O
rice O
response O
to O
simultaneous O
high O
temperature O
stress O
and O
X. O
oryzae O
infection O
35 O
. O
The O
results O
from O
our O
current O
study O
show O
that O
cross-talk O
among O
ABA, O
JA O
and O
SA O
response O
pathways O
makes O
the O
contribution O
of O
each O
hormone O
to O
the O
rice O
transcriptome O
unclear O
(Fig. O
3 O
). O
Notably, O
ABA-regulated O
genes O
appear O
to O
dominate O
the O
hormone O
response O
during O
stress. O
That O
is, O
of O
the O
metaDEGs O
responsive O
to O
JA O
and O
SA, O
most O
were O
also O
responsive O
to O
ABA O
(Fig. O
3 O
, O
Table O
S5 O
). O
These O
intertwined O
pathways O
are O
critical O
to O
plant O
stress O
responses, O
which O
frequently O
occur O
simultaneously, O
emphasizing O
that O
additional O
study O
of O
hormonal O
cross-talk O
is O
needed O
to O
provide O
insights O
into O
how O
to O
improve O
plant O
health. O

Based O
on O
these O
observations, O
we O
decided O
to O
collect O
samples O
at O

we O
performed O

The O
DNA O

was O
provided O
by O
a O
crab-like O
structure O
composed O
mainly O
of O
a O
β O

a O

subunit O
[ O

]. O
When O
a O
specific O
mutation O
occurred O
in O
the O
rpoB O
gene, O
the O
rifampin O
molecule O
might O
be O
unable O
to O
block O
transcription O
due O
to O
its O
inability O
to O
form O
tight O
molecular O
forces O
(such O
as O

and O
thus, O
it O

RNA O
polymerase O
(RNAP) O
is O
highly O

in O
all O

and O
is O
directly O
involved O
in O
the O
transcription O
of O
all O
genes O
in O
the O
genome. O
Since O
the O
β O
subunit O
is O
a O
critical O
subunit O
of O
the O
transcriptional O
machinery, O
RNAP, O
the O
rpoB O
mutation O
will O
change O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
β O
subunit O
and O
even O
RNAP, O
resulting O
in O
damage O
to O
global O
transcription. O
Therefore, O
it O
will O
affect O
the O
physiological O
characteristics O
of O
the O

and O
generate O

Mutation O
of O
these O

In O
summary, O
so O
far O
there O
has O
been O
no O
information O
on O
the O
mechanism O
of O
rifampin O
resistance O
in O
R. O
anatipestifer. O
Based O
on O
previous O
references O
and O
knowledge O
of O
R. O
anatipestifer O
resistance, O
our O
study O
suggests O
that O
rifampin O
resistance O
of O
R. O
anatipestifer O
isolates O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
mutations. O
We O
attempted O
to O
restore O
the O
mutant O
type O
of O
isolates O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
by O
using O
ATCC O
11845 O
as O
the O
parental O
generation O
to O
elucidate O
the O
origin O
of O
R. O
anatipestifer O
rifampin O
resistance. O
In O
this O
study, O
the O
rpoB O
protein O
sequences O
of O
18 O
R. O
anatipestifer O
strains O
were O
compared, O
and O
we O
speculated O
and O
validated O
the O
mutation O
sites O
that O
might O
be O
related O
to O
rifampin O
resistance. O
We O
then O
isolated O
rifampin-resistant O
mutants O
from O
ATCC O
11845 O
and O
analyzed O
a O
number O
of O
phenotypic O
characteristics O
of O
these O
mutants, O
including O
growth, O
growth O
in O
competition, O
nitroprusside O
sensitivity O
and O
hydrogen O
peroxide O
sensitivity. O
Finally, O
the O
fitness O
of O
the O
rpoB O
mutants O
was O
evaluated O
in O
vivo. O

For O
example, O
the O
T460 O
residue O
in O
Arabidopsis O
AtAMT1 O
is O
conserved O
in O
all O
plant O
AMT1 O
proteins, O
and O
controls O
ammonium O
transport O
activity O
through O
phosphorylation O
and O
inactivation O
by O
the O
kinase O
CIPK23 O
upon O
extracellular O
ammonium O
exposure O
[ O
22 O
– O
24 O
]. O
A O
phosphomimetic O
mutation O
of O
MpAMT1;2 O
(T475D) O
from O
Marchantia O
polymorpha O
also O
exhibited O
complete O
loss O
of O
ammonium O
transport O
activity O
[ O
25 O
]. O
With O
regards O
to O
AMT2-type O
ammonium O
transporters, O
an O
alanine O
(A) O
is O
substituted O
for O
the O
threonine O
(T) O
at O
the O
corresponding O
T460 O
site O
of O
AtAMT1;1. O
Therefore, O
it O
seems O
that O
AMT2-type O
AMTs O
may O
play O
a O
unique O
role O
other O
than O
ammonium O
uptake. O
Recent O
studies O
revealed O
that O
an O
AMT2-type O
ammonium O
transporter, O
AtAMT2.1, O
not O
only O
participates O
in O
ammonium O
uptake, O
but O
also O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
translocation O
of O
ammonium O
from O
the O
root O
to O
the O
shoot O
through O
xylem O
loading O
[ O
26 O
]. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
sequence O
alignment O
and O
phylogenetic O
analysis O
indicated O
that O
TaAMT2;3a O
is O
a O
typical O
AMT2-type O
ammonium O
transporter. O
In O
addition, O
the O
high O
expression O
levels O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O
in O
leaves O
imply O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
involved O
in O
ammonium O
translocation O
in O
leaves. O
As O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
executors O
of O
nutrient O
transport, O
plant O
AMTs O
also O
play O
key O
roles O
in O
the O
interactions O
between O
plants O
and O
microbes, O
especially O
obligate O
biotrophic O
fungi. O
An O
increasing O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
plant O
AMTs O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
mutualistic O
symbiosis O
of O
Arbuscular O
mycorrhizae O
(AM) O
fungi. O
Most O
of O
these O
AMTs O
belong O
to O
the O
AMT2 O
subfamily O
and O
are O
highly O
or O
exclusively O
expressed O
in O
AM-colonized O

The O

the O

the O

Our O

the O

have O

Accumulating O
body O

suggests O
that O
inflammation O
in O
the O

(sterile O

is O
mediated O
via O
the O
inflammasome; O
an O

complex O
that O
regulates O
release O
of O
proinflammatory O

. O
Although O
several O

The O

contains O
NLRP3 O
associated O
with O
an O
apoptosis-associated O
speck-like O
protein O
containing O
a O
caspase O
recruitment O
domain O
(ASC), O
which O
recruits O
caspase-1 O

induces O
its O

Since O
caspase-1 O
is O
an O
IL-1β-converting O
enzyme O
12 O
, O
NLRP3 O
inflammasome-driven O
caspase-1 O
activation O
induces O
the O

the O

Several O
producers O
grew O
barley O
for O
multiple O
end-uses O
and O
were O
interested O
in O
a O
multi-purpose O
barley. O
Barley O
was O
the O
main O
crop O
only O
for O
farmers O
who O
were O
contract O
growing O
for O
malt O
houses. O
For O
those O
producers, O
variety O
selection O
was O
made O
by O
contract O
from O
the O
buyer. O
However, O
the O
majority O
of O
producers O
interviewed O
were O
primarily O
selling O
into O
the O
feed O
market, O
which O
reflects O
the O
survey O
results. O
Several O
farmers O
interviewed O
talked O
about O
the O
advantages O
that O
barley O
had O
in O
terms O
of O
land O
use, O
labor O
requirements, O
and O
equipment O
compliment. O
Barley O
was O
often O
grown O
as O
a O
“catch O
crop” O
to O
make O
use O
of O
nutrients O
left O
over O
from O
the O
previous O
crop’s O
fertility O
program, O
particularly O
when O
grown O
as O
a O
winter O
crop. O
More O
importantly, O
several O
farmers O
noted O
that O
crops O
following O
barley O
had O
reduced O
weed O
pressure O
and O
increased O
yield. O
According O
to O
farmers O
interviewed, O
barley O
is O
more O
amenable O
to O
no-till O
systems O
without O
herbicides O
than O
many O
other O
crops O
in O
their O
experience. O
Several O
farmers O
growing O
barley O
were O
organic O
dairy O
producers. O
Because O
cattle O
are O
ruminants, O
they O
can O
digest O
barley O
hulls, O
and O
naked O
barley O
is O
not O
as O
important O
for O
their O
farming O
systems. O
These O
producers O
also O
emphasized O
the O
importance O
of O
barley O
for O
producing O
high-quality O
organic O
straw. O
By O
contrast, O
many O
of O
the O
producers O
who O
grow O
barley O
as O
a O
cash O
crop O
do O
not O
harvest O
the O
straw O
but O
will O
instead O
till O
it O
in O
for O
organic O
matter O
or O
plant O
into O
the O
residue, O
which O
serves O
as O
a O
mulch. O
The O
exceptions O
were O
farmers O
in O
straw-deficient O
areas O
with O
either O
high O
concentrations O
of O
dairy O
farms O
or O
near O
suburban O
markets. O
One O
of O
the O
dairy O
producers O
interviewed O
grows O
barley O
as O
an O
intercrop O
with O
peas. O
The O
mixture O
is O
harvested O
before O
the O
grain O
matures O
and O
is O
fed O
as O
green O
chop. O
The O
mixture O
is O
high O
in O
total O
digestible O
nutrients O
and O
he O
noted O
that O
the O
cattle O
find O
it O
highly O
palatable. O
Other O
dairy O
producers O
will O
harvest O
the O
grain O
and O
mix O
it O
on O
farm O
with O
other O
components O
to O
make O
a O
balanced O
ration. O
The O
interview O
responses O
expanded O
on O
the O
survey O
results, O
particularly O
with O
respect O
to O
variety O
selection. O
Several O
talked O
about O
the O
uncertainty O
presented O
by O
climate O
change, O
particularly O
with O
changing O
precipitation O
patterns O
and O
timing O
of O
planting. O
Climate O
change O
was O
also O
thought O
by O
some O
respondents O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
increasing O
disease O
pressure. O

In O
this O
study, O
Culley O
and O
colleagues O
showed O
that O
the O
age O
of O
initial O
infection O
played O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
the O
secondary O
response O
of O
these O
same O
animals O
to O
rechallenge O
with O
RSV O
at O
12 O
weeks O
of O
age. O
Interestingly, O
if O
the O
mice O
were O
initially O
infected O
at O
1 O
– O
7 O
days O
of O
age, O
then O
their O
immune O
response O
to O
rechallenge O
at O
12 O
weeks O
of O
age O
was O
characterized O
by O
enhanced O
bronchoalveolar O
lavage O
(BAL) O
cellularity O
including O
increased O
eosinophil O
and O
neutrophil O
numbers, O
increased O
CD8+ O
T O
cell O
numbers, O
and O
increased O
CD4+ O
T O
cell O
production O
of O
intracellular O
IL-4. O
The O
data O
seemed O
to O
indicate O
that O
a O
CD4+ O
response O
was O
important O
in O
creating O
the O
immune O
memory O
response O
of O
the O
neonatal O
mice O
to O
RSV, O
while O
a O
CD8+ O
response O
seemed O
important O
in O
the O
older O
animals O
(age O
4 O
– O
8 O
wks). O
Furthermore, O
these O
data O
suggested O
that O
the O
Th2 O
skewing O
of O
the O
immune O
response O
was O
likely O
to O
be O
important O
in O
eliciting O
disease O
pathogenesis. O
Although O
this O
work O
was O
seminal O
in O
demonstrating O
the O
importance O
of O
timing O
(7 O
d O
vs. O
4 O
wks) O
of O
the O
initial O
infection O
on O
the O
subsequent O
T O
cell O
responses, O
it O
did O
not O
link O
these O
events O
with O
enhanced O
pulmonary O
dysfunction O
or O
demonstrate O
the O
prolonged O
contribution O
of O
these O
T O
cell O
responses O
to O
pathophysiological O
events O
involved O
in O
airway O
remodeling O
associated O
with O
asthma. O
Recently, O
Dakhama O
and O
colleagues[ O
14 O
] O
demonstrated O
that O
indeed O
timing O
of O
initial O
infection O
was O
a O
critical O
factor O
in O
determining O
the O
airway O
response O
to O
subsequent O
RSV O
infection. O
However, O
other O
risk O
factors O
for O
the O
development O
of O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
and O
wheeze O
(i.e., O
asthma) O
in O
humans O
exist O
and O
the O
enhancement O
of O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
by O
RSV O
may O
be O
dependent O
on O
the O
individual's O
atopic O
background O
and O
current O
exposure O
to O
allergens O
or O
other O
environmental O
factors. O
Our O
hypothesis O
was O
that O
early O
exposure O
to O
RSV O
and O
allergen O
act O
synergistically O
to O
illicit O
inflammatory O
responses O
and O
long-term O
functional O
changes O
in O
the O
developing O
lung. O

Fluid O
therapy O
only O
differed O
between O
survivors O
and O
non-survivors O
in O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
the O
resuscitation O
period O
(6–24 O
h), O
where O
the O
non-survivors O
received O
more O
volume O
expansion. O
This O
probably O
reflects O
therapeutic O
efforts O
to O
restore O
haemodynamic O
stability O
in O
patients O
with O
prolonged O
circulatory O
failure O
not O
responding O
to O
initial O
fluid O
therapy, O
i.e. O
those O
with O
a O
poor O
prognosis. O
Maximum O
lactate O
level O
also O
correlated O
with O
mortality, O
illustrating O
the O
impact O
of O
disease O
severity, O
also O
seen O
in O
previous O
studies O
[ O
39 O
, O
40 O
]. O
The O
distribution O
of O
aetiologic O
pathogens O
and O
foci O
might O
have O
been O
influenced O
by O
the O
restricted O
inclusion O
material O
comprising O
patients O
from O
medical O
wards O
and O
the O
ICU O
only. O
E. B-PATH
coli I-PATH
was O
the O
most O
prevalent O
pathogen, O
which O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
a O
previous O
study O
including O
all O
patients O
with O
bacteraemia O
in O
the O
same O
hospital O
[ O
41 O
]. O
S. B-PATH
aureus, I-PATH
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
was O
found O
in O
only O
six O
patients O
(7%). O
This O
incidence O
is O
lower O
than O
seen O
in O
many O
other O
studies O
(12–18%) O
based O
on O
positive O
blood O
cultures O
[ O
2 O
, O
41 O
, O

]. O
Our O
findings O
are O
supported O
by O
the O
National O
Register O
of O
Community-Acquired O
Sepsis O
of O
the O
Swedish O
Infectious O
Diseases O

where O
S. B-PATH

was O
the O
causing O
pathogen O
in O
8–10% O
of O
cases O
during O
the O

period O
of O
time O
[ O

high O
mortality O
in O
the O

in O
our O
material O
(4/6) O
is O
deemed O
not O
to O
be O
representative O
but O
rather O
an O
effect O
of O
the O
small O

size. O
The O
prevalence O

antibiotic O

in O

is O
low, O
and O
our O
finding O

in O
this O

is O
in O

Early O

the O

These O

because O
they O
are O
considered O
most O

in O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
it O
is O
not O
only O
gram-negatives O
and O
lipopolysaccharides O
(LPS) O
that O
can O
induce O
inflammation; O
other O
cell O
components O
and O
metabolites O
can O
be O
involved, O
and O
there O
are O
also O
several O
gram-positive O
pathogenic O
(such O
as O
Enterococcus, O
which O
is O
often O
found O
as O
a O
contaminant O
in O
foods) O
and O
opportunistic O
pathogenic O
bacteria O
(such O
as O
Bifidobacterium) O
that O
can O
induce O
inflammation O
(Gonzalez-Navajas O
et O
al., O
2008 O
). O
An O
endeavour O
searching O
for O
the O
connection O
between O
gut O
microbiota O
and O
systemic O
inflammation O
showed O
that O
approximately O
9% O
of O
the O
total O
variability O
of O
the O
microbiota O
was O
correlated O
to O
the O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
IL-8 O
and O
IL-6 O
(Biagi O
et O
al., O
2010 O
). O
All O
taxa O
that O
showed O
a O
slightly O
positive O
association O
with O
either O
IL-6 O
or O
IL-8 O
belonged O
to O
the O
phylum O
Proteobacteria O
(Biagi O
et O
al., O
2010 O
). O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
low-grade O
systemic O
inflammation O
constitutes O
a O
common O
denominator O
in O
neurodegenerative O
and O
vascular O
diseases, O
possibly O
via O
detrimental O
effects O
on O
the O
vasculature O
and O
leading O
to O
a O
dysfunctional O
brain-blood O
barrier O
and O
inflammatory O
stimuli O
of O
the O
brain. O
Elevated O
peripheral O
inflammation O
could O
also O
affect O
brain O
inflammation O
by O
the O
“priming” O
of O
neurones, O
i.e. O
making O
them O
more O
prone O
to O
a O
pro-inflammatory O
response O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
tissue O
damage O
(Holmes O
et O
al., O
2009 O
). O
In O
addition, O
chronic O
inflammation O
during O
foetal O
and O
childhood O
development O
could O
negatively O
affect O
brain O
development O
and O
lower O
the O
“cognitive O
reserve” O
(Borenstein O
et O
al., O
2006 O
). O
The O
researchers O
noted O
that O
the O
affected O
AD O
brains O
are O
largely O
inflamed, O
glial O
cells O
rushing O
to O
the O
brain O
regions O
that O
become O
ill O
and O
trying O
to O
clean O
up O
waste O
products O
from O
cells O
and O
plaque, O
but O
once O
up O
to O
this O
area, O
they O
in O
fact O
are O
urged O
to O
liberate O
more O
Aβ O
harmful, O
precipitate O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
plaque, O
which O
attracts O
more O
accurate O
glial O
cells, O
and O
so O
on. O

However, O
chronic, O
dysregulated O
activation O
of O
microglia O
can O
lead O
to O
elevated O
inflammatory O
tone O
ultimately O
resulting O
in O
the O
malfunction O
or O
damage O
of O
brain O
cells. O
The O
role O
of O
the O
microbiota O
in O
addition O
to O
what O
drives O
this O
dysregulation O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
fully O
understood. O
AD O
mice O
and O
gut O
microbiota O
A O
recent O
experimental O
study O
conducted O
by O
Harach O
et O

observed O
marked O
differences O
of O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
composition O
between O
aged O
AD O
mice O
and O
healthy O
WT O
mice O
and O
strongly O
advocated O
that O
a O
distinct O
microbial O
constitution O
in O
AD O
mice O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O
cerebral O
Aβ O
amyloidosis O
(Harach O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
In O
this O
study, O
the O
authors O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
abundance O
of O
the O
two O
major O
phyla O
(Firmicutes O
andBacteroidetes) O
in O
the O
fecal O
microbiota O
is O
dramatically O
altered O
by O
host O
genetics. O
At O
genus O
level, O
Allobaculum O
and O
Akkermansia O
were O
decreased O
in O
transgenic O
CONVR-APPPS1 O
mice O
and O
unclassified O
genera O
of O
Rikenellaceae O
and O
S24-7 O
were O
increased. O
Reduced O
levels O
of O
Akkermansia O
have O
been O
associated O
with O
obesity O
and O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
in O
mice O
(Everard O
et O
al., O
2013 O
), O
and O
the O
prebiotic-induced O
restoration O
of O
Akkermansia O
in O
the O
gut O
resulted O
in O
a O
lower O
fat-mass O
gain O
and O
decreased O
systemic O
inflammation O
(two O
discussed O
risk O
factors O
in O
the O
development O
of O

pathology). O
Furthermore, O
the O
relative O
abundance O
of O
several O
bacterial O
genera O
was O
correlated O
with O
the O
amount O
of O

Aß42 O
in O
the O

(Harach O

The O
increased O
understanding O
of O
the O

the O
gut O

on O
human O
health O
resulted O
in O
attempts O
to O
manipulate O
its O
composition O
by O
the O
use O
of O
probiotics O
and O
prebiotics, O
from O
both O
prophylactic O
and O
therapeutic O
perspectives. O
Probiotics O
are O
defined O
as O
live O
microbial O
organisms O
that, O
when O
consumed O
in O
adequate O
quantities, O
confer O
health O
benefits O
to O
the O
host O
(Berg, O
1998 O
). O
Prebiotics O
are O
chemical O
substances, O
usually O
oligosaccharides, O
acting O
as O
substrates O
specifically O
for O
the O
host’s O
autochthonous O
probiotic O
bacteria, O
and O
thus O
promoting O
their O
growth. O

Consequently, O
there O
is O
a O
medical O
need O
for O
new O
approaches O
and O
other O
targets O
to O
overcome O
resistance. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
evaluate O
a O
new O
compound, O
a O
next O

radioimmunoconjugate O
(RIC), O
for O

The O

of O

Plant O
hormones, O
including O
abscisic O
acid O
(ABA) O
and O
gibberellin O
(GA), O
have O
long O
been O
known O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
cold O
response O
[ O
11 O
, O
12 O
]. O
Current O
cold O
responsive O
genes O
mostly O
originate O
from O
ancient O
cold O
responsive O
genes O
that O
have O
been O
conserved O
during O
the O
diversification O
of O
land O
plants, O
and O
have O
been O
especially O
vital O
in O
plant O
lineages O
that O
have O
undergone O
long-term O
radiation O
from O
tropical O
regions O
to O
temperate O
regions O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Investigations O
in O
many O
plant O
species O
have O
shown O
that O
numerous O
genes O
are O
up- O
or O
down-regulated O
during O
cold O
treatment, O
and O
these O
studies O
have O
been O
particularly O
informative O
in O
Arabidopsis O
[ O
2 O
, O
11 O
, O
14 O
, O
15 O
]. O
These O
studies O
show O
that O
gene O
regulation O
in O
cold O
acclimation O
and O
freezing O
stress O
acts O
at O
multiple O
levels. O
For O
instance, O
removal O
of O
repressive O
histone O
modifications O
on O
chromatin O
by O
HOS15, O
a O
WD40-repeat O
protein, O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
increase O
transcription O
of O
cold-regulated O
(COR) O
genes O
[ O
16 O
]. O
Epigenetic O
regulation O
of O
VERNALIZATION O
INSENSITIVE3 O
and O
FLOWERING O
LOCUS O
C O
is O
also O
involved, O
and O
requires O
both O
cold O
acclimation O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
daily O
warm O
temperature O
(15 O
°C O
or O
higher) O
[ O

]. O
C-repeat-binding O
factors O
1–3 O
(CBF1–3) O
are O
transcription O
factors O
that O
integrate O
cold O
signals O
with O
altered O
gene O
expressions, O
including O
such O
COR O
genes O
as O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinases O
(MAPKs) O
[ O
11 O
, O
18 O
]. O
Compared O
with O
cereal O
crops O
and O
Arabidopsis, O
studies O
on O
cold O
acclimation O
in O
trees O
are O
relatively O
few. O
The O
tea O
plant O
(Camellia O
sinensis O
(L.) O
O. O
Kuntze) O
is O
widely O
planted O
to O
produce O
leaves O
for O
making O
tea. O
It O
is O
a O
perennial O
and O
evergreen O
tree O
that O
is O
restricted O
to O
temperate, O
subtropical O
and O
tropical O
production O
zones O
because O
tea O
plants O
are O
vulnerable O
to O
cold O
injury, O
especially O
during O
freezing O
winters. O
Low O
temperature O
appears O
to O
cause O
damage O
in O
the O
thylakoid O
membrane O
of O
cold-susceptible O
tea O
plants O
[ O
19 O
], O
as O
has O
been O
seen O
in O
other O
cold-susceptible O
species O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O

Third, O
the O
data O
used O
to O
estimate O
the O
non-medical O
direct O
costs O
(i.e., O
time O
lost O
and O
monetary O
expenses), O
intangible O
costs O
(i.e., O
loss O
of O
well-being O
for O
the O
patient O
and O
her O
close O
family O
and O
friends) O
and O
presenteeism O
costs O
(i.e., O
the O
loss O
of O
productivity O
due O
to O
a O
UTI O
while O
the O
patient O
was O
working) O
were O
not O
available. O
Fourth, O
the O
friction O
cost O
method O
was O
chosen O
to O
determinate O
the O
indirect O
costs. O
The O
cost’s O
results O
should O
be O
interpreted O
with O
caution O
because O
this O
method O
is O
controversial O
in O
cases O
of O
short-term O
disease. O
The O
human O
capital O
approach O
overstates O
the O
production O
lost O
because O
the O
sick O
employee’s O
colleagues O
can O
offset O
the O
absence O
via O
increased O
productivity O
[ O
27 O
]. O
Consequently, O
the O
estimates O
of O
friction O
costs O
should O
represent O
the O
upper O
bound O
of O
the O
estimates O
of O
the O
short-term O
indirect O
costs O
[ O
27 O
]. O
However, O
in O
cases O
involving O
teamwork, O
the O
absence O
of O
an O
employee O
can O
also O
reduce O
the O
production O
of O
several O
employees O
[ O
39 O
]. O
Fifth, O
although O
the O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
exclude O
the O
costs O
of O
reinfection, O
the O
women O
who O
were O
symptomatic O
at O
2 O
weeks O
might O
have O
experienced O
a O
reinfection O
between O
the O
second O
and O
the O
eighth O
weeks, O
and O
these O
costs O
were O
taken O
into O
account O
because O
differences O
between O
relapses O
and O
reinfections O
could O
not O
be O
identified O
during O
this O
period. O
Sixth, O
the O
costs O
of O
long-term O
symptomatic O
failure O
(i.e., O
the O
persistence O
of O
symptoms O
after O
8 O
weeks) O
could O
not O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
because O
the O
follow-up O
period O
stopped O
after O
8 O
weeks. O
Seventh, O
from O
the O
patient O
perspective, O
the O
costs O
could O
have O
been O
overestimated O
because O
some O
companies O
might O
have O
paid O
their O
employees O
during O
their O
sick O
leaves; O
or O
these O
costs O
could O
also O
have O
been O
underestimated O
because O
there O
were O
no O
data O
from O
which O
excess O
fees O
for O
medical O
imaging O
procedures O
could O
be O
assessed. O
Another O
point O
from O
the O
patient O
perspective O
is O
the O
costs O
of O
over O
the O
counter O
drugs, O
which O
could O
not O
still O
have O
been O
accounted O
for O
because O
costs O
differ O
between O
retail O
outlets. O
None O
of O
these O
data O
were O
available. O
As O
last O
limitation, O
the O
results O
of O
diagnostic O
tests O
prescribed O
by O
physicians O
were O
not O
collected. O

recently O
in O
its O

, O
whereas O
MI O

is O
not O
induced O
inside O

64 O

65 O
. O
However, O
recent O
studies O
show O
that O
the O
SsrB-regulated O
SPI-2 O
genes O
are O
already O
expressed O
in O
the O
gut O

66 O
, O
67 O
where O
the O
expression O
of O
iol O
genes O
might O
additionally O
be O
favored O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
bicarbonate. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
mature O
RssR O
is O
produced O
by O
processing O
of O
the O
iolB O
mRNA O
or O
of O
an O
RssR O
precursor O

that O
is O
transcribed O
from O

within O
the O
iolB O
coding O
region O
by O
SsrB O
and/or O
other O
regulatory O
factors, O
or O
both. O
As O
SsrB O
binding O
to O
a O
site O
within O
iolB O
might O
impair O
transcription O
of O
this O
gene, O
we O
hypothesize O
an O
only O
temporary O
interaction O
to O
stimulate O
the O
activation O
of O

MI O

pathway. O
The O
expressions O
of O
almost O
a O
fifth O
of O
all O
S. O

are O
controlled O
by O
the O

. O
The O
Hfq O
regulon O
not O
only O
includes O
genes O
involved O
in O
pathogenicity O
or O
the O
flagellar O

but O
also O
those O

in O
fatty O

in O
the O

of O
amino O

nitrogen, O
purine O
and O

and O

68 O
. O
The O
postulated O
binding O
of O
RssR O
by O
Hfq O
31 O
prompted O
us O
to O
study O
the O
effect O
of O
an O
hfq O
mutant O
on O
MI O
degradation. O
We O
demonstrate O
that O
in O
a O
rich O
medium, O
strain O
14028 O
∆hfq O
showed O
a O
weaker O
total O
growth O
than O
strain O
14028, O
as O
similarly O
observed O
previously O
in O
minimal O
acidic O
medium, O
indicating O
that O
Hfq O
controls O
the O
regulation O
of O

rate O
69 O
. O
However, O
such O
a O
pleiotropic O
effect O
was O
not O
observed O
with O
a O
hfq O
deletion O
mutant O
of O
strain O
SL1344 O
70 O
, O
a O
distinction O
that O
might O
be O
strain-specific O
or O
due O
to O
the O

conditions. O

The O
effect O
of O
Solanum O

by O
taking O
an O

of O

which O
is O
controlled O
by O

It O
is O
been O
previously O
reported O
that O
the O
quorum O

of O
Solanum O

is O
highly O
influenced O
by O
factors O
such O
as O
bacterial O
density, O

of O

during O

competing O
with O
iron-binding O
protein O

[ O
26 O
]. O
Iron O
is O
as O
vital O
factor O
for O
microbial O
virulence, O
therefore O
inhibition O
of O
pyoverdin O
leads O
to O
iron O
deficiency O
in O
pathogen O
which O
in O
turn O
inhibit O
bacterial O
virulence. O
It O
is O
evident O
that O
Pseudomonas B-PATH

respiratory O
infections O
initiated O
by O
the O
adherence O
of O
the O
pathogen O
to O
the O
oral-pharyngeal O

followed O
by O

therefore O
inability O
of O
a O
pathogen O
will O
disable O
the O
persistence O
of O

[ O

]. O
Administration O
of O
STRE O
decreased O
the O
production O
of O
pyoverdin O
in O
the O

therefore O
it O
is O

that O

Importantly O
bacterial O

not O
effected O

which O
suggests O
that O
reduction O
in O
virulence O
factors O
was O
not O
because O
of O
bacterial O
death O
but O
as O
a O
result O
of O

A O

Recently, O
we O
identified O
ReiD, O
which O

by O
an O
orphan O
gene O
(STM4423) O
and O
is O
unique O
to O
S. O
Typhimurium O
strains O
capable O
of O
using O

ReiD O
is O
a O
regulator O
that O
acts O
as O
a O
DNA-binding O
protein O
to O
induce O
the O
expression O
of O
several O
iol O
genes, O
thus O
contributing O
to O
the O
regulation O
of O
MI O

by O
S. O
Typhimurium O
14 O
. O
ReiD O
stimulates O
the O

, O
the O
promoter O
of O
the O
iolE/iolG1 O
(STM4424/STM4425) O
operon O
that O
encodes O
the O
first O
two O

of O
the O

Gene O
reiD O
is O
also O
known O
to O

were O
found O
to O
be O
attenuated O
in O

21 O
. O
RNA-sequencing O
(RNA-seq) O
and O
Hfq-Co-Immunoprecipitation O
(Co-IP) O
identified O
the O
presence O
of O
two O
small O

suggesting O
that O
they O
might O
be O

. O
As O
many O
sRNAs O
are O
important O
and O
versatile O
regulatory O
elements O
that O
are O
involved O
in O
numerous O
cellular O
processes, O

we O
investigated O
the O
role O

sRNAs O
STnc1740 O

RssR O
(STnc2160) O
in O

negatively O

influence O
the O

for O
all O

(Fig. O

Interestingly, O

is O
immediately O
downstream O
of O

(Rv1663 O

In O

Furthermore, O
it O
can O
also O
be O
speculated O
that O
increased O

of O
cyp139a1 O

Discussion O
This O
initial O
study O
conducted O
in O
France O
on O
the O
costs O
of O
community O
UTIs O
in O
women O
over O
18 O
years O
of O
age O
estimated O
a O
total O
cost O
from O
the O
societal O
perspective O
of O
€58 O
million O
in O
2012, O
€44 O
million O
for O
direct O
costs O
and O
€14 O
million O
for O
indirect O
costs. O
Half O
of O
this O
cost O
was O
supported O
by O
the O
French O
National O
Health O
Insurance, O
and O
half O
was O
supported O
by O
the O
patients O
(before O
private O
complementary O
health O
insurance O
participation). O
Visits O
represented O
the O
largest O
expense O
item O
followed O
by O
sick O
leave O
and O
prescription O
drugs. O
Although O
very O
expensive, O
hospitalizations O
were O
rare O
and O
therefore O
represented O
the O
smallest O
expense O
item. O
The O
costs O
for O
75 O
% O
of O
the O
women O
were O
below O
the O
mean O
cost. O
Additional O
visits O
with O
specialist O
physicians, O
ultrasounds, O
hospitalizations O
and O
sick O
leave O
concerned O
less O
than O
one O
quarter O
of O
the O
women. O
The O
important O
costs O
of O
these O
additional O
health O
care O
procedures O
clearly O
increased O
the O
mean O
UTI O
cost. O
An O
important O
strength O
of O
this O
study O
was O
the O
use O
of O
a O
sampling O
design. O

Moreover, O
a O
slight O
increase O
in O
the O
VitB6 O
content O
in O
mock-inoculated O
tomato O
leaves O
may O
be O
responsive O
to O
stress O
or O
wounding O
caused O
by O
mock O
infiltration. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
expression O
of O
VitB6 O
biosynthetic O
genes O
in O
tomato O
down-regulated O
after O
infection O
with O
XCV O
and O
hence O
reduced O
VitB6 O
content O
might O
be O
a O
natural O
response O
of O
plants O
to O
pathogenic O
infection O
as O
a O
part O
of O
defense O
mechanism O
18 O
. O
Previous O
studies O
showed O
thatVitB6 O
vitamers O
can O
act O
as O
antioxidant O
in O
plants O
and O
may O
act O
as O
an O
important O
modulator O
of O
redox O
status O
during O
pathogen O
defense O
response O
12 O
, O
18 O
, O
49 O
. O
When O
compared O
with O
those O
in O
the O
control O
plants, O
increased O
disease O
level O
and O
increased O
accumulation O
of O
SOD O
after O
infection O
with O
XCV O
was O
observed. O
The O
increase O
of O
SOD O
activity O
accelerated O
enzymatic O
conversion O
of O
the O
superoxide O
anion O
to O
H O
2 O
O O
2 O
and O
led O
to O
further O
accumulation O
of O
H O
2 O
O O
2 O
in O
the O
XCV O
inoculated O
plants. O
Hence, O
increased O
accumulation O
of O
H O
2 O
O O
2 O
will O
lead O
to O
production O
of O
CAT O
and O
POD. O
We O
also O
found O
that O
activity O
of O
PPO O
was O
induced O
in O
XCV O
inoculated O
plants O
compared O
to O
those O
in O

Moreover, O
antioxidant O

was O
higher O
in O
B. O

activity O
in O
mock-inoculated O
healthy O
control O
was O
consistently O
present O
in O
all O
the O
test O
plants. O
The O
enzyme O
activity O
in O
control O
plants O
increased O
over O
time O
after O
inoculation O
showing O
native O
antioxidant O
enzyme O
presence. O
Further, O
tomato O
plants O
infiltrated O
with O
XCV O
showed O
increased O
disease O
symptoms O
compared O
to O
those O
infiltrated O
with O
biocontrol O
agent, O
B. O

CBR05. O
However, O
co-inoculation O
with O
B. O
subtilis O
showed O
increased O
plant O
growth O
and O
decreased O
disease O
severity. O

To O
demonstrate O
this O
we O
constructed O
constrained O
trees O
that O
grouped O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
together O
based O
on O
their O
associated O
phyla, O
we O
also O
generated O
100 O
random O
trees. O
According O
to O
the O
approximately O
unbiased O
test O
our O
representative O
phylogeny O
is O
better O
than O
all O
random O
or O
constrained O

(P O

Our O
representative O
phylogeny O
shows O
that O
all O
the O
plant O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
are O
grouped O
together O
in O
a O
single O
polyphyletic O
clade O
along O
with O
a O
number O
of O
basal O
fungal O
groups O
namely O
the O
incertae O
sedis O
species O
Mitosporidium O
daphnia O
and O
Rozella O
allomycis O
along O
with O
the O
Zoopagomycota O
species O
Basidiobolus O
meristosporus. O
Next O
to O
this O
clade O
we O
find O
species O
belonging O
to O
the O
Blastocladiomycota O
(Allomyces O
macrogynus O
and O
Catenaria O
anguillulae), O
Chytridmycota O
(Spizellomyces O
punctatus O
and O
Gonapodya O
prolifera) O
and O
Mucoromycota O
phyla O
(Fig. O

). O
As O
noted O
above O
the O
branch O
supports O
for O
these O
groupings O
are O
extremely O
poor O
and O
in O
our O
view O
are O
not O
indicative O
of O
strong O
sister O
group O
relationships. O
Similarly O
the O
phylogeny O
with O
all O
462 O
proteins O
present O
also O
displays O
very O
poor O
bootstrap O
support O
values O
(Additional O

: O
Figure O
S6). O
To O
illustrate O
the O
degree O
of O
phylogenetic O
disagreement O
within O
the O
dataset, O
we O
reconstructed O
a O
neighbour-joining O
network O
of O
phylogenetic O
splits O
within O
the O
representative O
dataset O
alignment O
(Additional O

: O
Figure O

The O
network O
is O
highly O
congruent O
with O
the O
representative O
phylogeny O
(Fig. O

). O
Strongly O
supported O
clades O
found O
in O
the O
phylogeny O
can O
also O
be O
clearly O
seen O
in O
the O
network. O
However, O
there O
is O
a O
large O
degree O
of O
conflict O
regarding O
the O
sister O
group O
relationships O
amongst O
these O
clades O
as O
illustrated O
by O
the O
large O
number O
of O
alternative O
splits O
between O
clades O
(Additional O
file O
29 O
: O
Figure O
S6). O
Based, O
on O
both O
our O
phylogenetic O
and O
network O
analyses O
we O
suggest O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
confidently O
infer O
the O
true O
phylogenetic O
relationships O
amongst O
these O
proteins. O

Thus, O
it O
is O
now O
accepted O
that O
human O
pathogenic O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
are O
able O
to O
form O
a O
mutualistic O
relationships O
with O
Heterorhabditis O
nematodes O
to O
infect O
insects O
efficiently, O
like O
other O
Photorhabdus O
nematode O
symbionts. O
Currently, O
two O
species: O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
comprise O
both O
clinical O
and O
entomopathogenic O
Photorhabdus O
strains O
derived O
from O
various O
locations O
(Kuwata O
et O
al. O
2008 O
; O
Thanwisai O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
To O
address O
the O
particular O
life O
style O
of O
Photorhabdus O
human O
pathogens, O
their O
diversity O
and O
evolutionary O
relationships O
have O
been O
intensively O
explored O
by O
implementing O
whole O
genome O
sequencing O
and O
transcriptomic O
analysis. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
bacteria O
have O
a O
relatively O
small O
genome, O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
P. O
luminesces O
(the O
closest O
relative), O
and O
display O
lower O
diversity O
of O
insecticidal O
toxins. O
The O
existence O
of O
many O
supplementary O
plasmids O
and O
pathogenicity O
islands O
in O
the O
genome O
has O
also O
been O
shown O
(Wilkinson O
et O
al. O
2009 O
, O
2010 O
). O
Current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
switch O
of O
these O
bacteria O
from O
nematodes O
to O
humans O
was O
facilitated O
by O
virulence O
genes O
(necessary O
for O
insect O
host O
infection) O
already O
present O
in O
the O
genome, O
as O
well O
as O
additional O
virulence O
factors O
(appropriate O
for O
infection O
of O
mammalian O
cells) O
acquired O
by O
horizontal O
transfer O
from O
other O
human O
pathogens O
(Hapeshi O
and O
Waterfield O
2017 O
). O
Unlike O
other O
species O
of O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus, O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
can O
grow O
at O
37 O
°C, O
undergoing O
the O
metabolic O
shift O
to O
adapt O
their O
metabolisms O
to O
the O
mammalian O
host O
(Mulley O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
Despite O
the O
considerable O
effort, O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
transmission O
of O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
to O
the O
human O
body O
are O
still O
unclear. O
The O
most O
probable O
scenario O
is O
that O
the O
nematode O
vector O
may O
penetrate O
the O
human O
skin O
and O
transmit O
microsymbionts, O
thereby O
causing O
infections O
(Hapeshi O

Conclusion O
The O

thus O

Nonetheless, O
it O

In O

To O

we O
measured O

This O
showed O

as O
expected O
(Supplementary O

In O

With O

LPS O
is O
a O

model O
to O

the O

Plasminogen O

[ O

Using O
a O
mouse O

of O
Alzheimer’s O

(AD), O
we O
recently O
showed O
that O
plasma O
PLG O

is O
protective O
against O

and O
drastically O
decreases O
the O

We O
also O
showed O
that O

exacerbates O
this O

[ O

]. O
In O
this O
case, O
amyloid O

induce O
an O

in O
the O

but O
depleting O
PLG O
only O

caused O
a O

leading O
to O
an O
important O
finding O
about O
the O

from O

Due O
to O
the O
link O
between O
systemic O

and O

we O
were O
interested O
to O
determine O
whether O

in O
the O

In O
this O

we O
depleted O

and O
then O
challenged O
the O

We O
analyzed O

that O
the O

due O

We O

the O
existence O

a O
significant O
pool O
of O
pan-Asian O

pan-tropical O
species O
with O
well-defined O
uses O
that O
have O
been O
already O
widely O
documented O
and O
even O
pharmacologically O
validated O
(i.e., O

These O
data O
appear O
to O
contradict O
Anderson O
(1985) O
who O
noted O
that O
only O
a O
small O
number O
of O
the O
species O
collected O
in O
the O
remote O
Hmong O
mountain O
villages O
in O
Thailand O
are O
cited O
elsewhere O
but O
may O
be O
explained O
by O
Anderson’s O
prior O
publication O
of O
his O
work, O
and O
also O
by O
the O
place O
of O
study O
[ O

]. O

Depending O
on O
the O
type O
of O
inference O
researchers O
want O
to O
make, O
they O
could O
face O
confounding, O
sampling O
bias, O
or O
transportability O
bias. O
Importantly, O
these O
issues O
apply O
to O
both O
the O
decision O
to O
focus O
on O
(for O
example) O
a O
WEIRD O
population O
as O
well O
as O
expanding O
the O
research O
to O
non-WEIRD O
populations. O
An O
exclusive O
focus O
on O
restricted O
samples O
comes O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
external O
validity. O
In O
medical O
research, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
repeated O
call O
to O
revalue O
external O
validity O
(e.g. O
Burchett O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Green O
and O
Glasgow O
2006 O
; O
Steckler O
and O
McLeroy O
2008 O
). O
While O
there O
had O
previously O
been O
a O
strong O
focus O
on O
internal O
validity, O
for O
example, O
focussing O
on O
questions O
such O
as O
whether O
confounding O
can O
be O
effectively O
ruled O
out O
in O
randomised O
controlled O
trials, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
call O
to O
also O
remember O
the O
importance O
of O
external O
validity O
(can O
we O
generalise O
the O
findings O
from O
this O
trial?). O
An O
obvious O
issue O
with O
relying O
on O
WEIRD, O
student O
and/or O
online O
samples O
would O
be O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
any O
conclusions O
would O
hold O
in O
different O
populations O
(Henrich O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Henry O
2008 O
; O
Sue O
1999 O
). O
Even O
more O
fundamentally, O
and O
before O
making O
causal O
inferences O
about O
other O
populations, O
researchers O
face O
the O
more O
basal O
problem O
of O
knowing O
whether O
they O
are O
measuring O
the O
same O
‘thing’ O
in O
different O
populations. O
This O
issue O
is O
well-understood O
in O
the O
field O
of O
psychometrics O
and O
has O
led O
to O
the O
development O
of O
measurement O
techniques O
and O
tests O
to O
examine O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
constructs O
are O
measured O
consistently O
across O
cultures O
(Heine O
et O
al. O
2002 O
; O
Hui O
and O
Triandis O
1985 O
; O
Nasif O
et O
al. O
1991 O
; O
Poortinga O
1989 O
; O
Van O
de O
Vijver O
and O
Leung O
1997 O
). O
We O
did O
not O
explicitly O
assess O
how O
many O
papers O
established O
equivalence O
of O
measurement O
between O
different O
samples, O
as O
we O
focused O
on O
the O
samples. O
Our O
standard O
psychological O
instruments, O
often O
developed O
by O
researchers O
working O
within O
WEIRD O
settings, O
may O
limit O
the O
generalisability O
of O
research O
findings O
(Ceci O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Konečni O
2010 O
; O
Rochat O
2010 O
). O
We O
therefore O
call O
for O
more O
research O
explicitly O
establishing O
that O
the O
same O
‘thing’ O
is O
measured O
in O
different O
populations. O

However, O
cathepsin O
L O
gene O
expression O
and O
protein O
level O
were O
enhanced O
in O
VACV-infected O
B O
cells. O
The O
authors O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O
reduced O
level O
of O
cathepsins O
may O
alter O
antigen O
processing O
and O
probably O
contributes O
to O
the O
loss O
of O
MHC O
class O
II O
function. O
Cathepsins O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
play O
essential O
roles O
in O
antigen O
processing, O
suggesting O
that O
they O
are O
involved O
in O
adaptive O
immune O
responses O
[ O
43 O
]. O
For O
example, O
studies O
focused O
on O
cathepsin O
S O
revealed O
that O
this O
acid-independent O
lysosomal O
cysteine O
protease O
mediates O
processing O
of O
outer O
capsid O
protein O
σ3 O
in O
macrophage-like O
P388D O
cells O
[ O
44 O
]. O
It O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
role O
of O
cysteine O
cathepsins O
in O
APCs, O
including O
DCs, O
is O
not O
limited O
only O
to O
antigen O
processing. O
Cathepsin O
B, O
D O
and O
S O
as O
well O
as O
cystatin O
C O
are O
important O
enzymes O
responsible O
for O
initiation O
of O
removal O
of O
the O
MHC O
II-associated O
chaperone O
invariant O
chain O
(li) O
from O
MHC O
II, O
thus O
permitting O
peptide O
association O
and O
intracellular O
transport O
of O
MHC O
II O
for O
display O
on O
the O
APC O
cell O
surface. O
Cathepsin O
S O
plays O
the O
most O
important O
role O
in O
this O
process O
[ O
45 O
– O
47 O
]. O
DCs O
isolated O
from O
cathepsin O
S-deficient O
C57BL/6 O
mice O
show O
a O
dramatically O
reduced O
distribution O
of O
MHC O
class O
II O
molecules O
on O
the O
cell O
surface O
[ O
48 O
]. O
Other O
studies O
also O
confirmed O
that O
cathepsin O
S O
is O
essential O
for O
efficient O
Ii O
processing, O
since O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
this O
protease, O
Ii O
degradation O
was O
markedly O
diminished O
in O
DCs O
[ O
49 O
] O
and O
B O
cells O
[ O
50 O
, O
51 O
]. O
Interestingly, O
cathepsin O
L-deficient O
mice O
also O
exhibited O
defective O
MHC O
II-associated O
antigen O
presentation O
in O
cortical O
thymic O
epithelial O
cells O
(cTECs) O
as O
a O
result O
of O
incomplete O
degradation O
of O
Ii. O
Moreover, O
in O
mice O
with O
cathepsin O
L O
deletion O
numbers O
of O
CD4 O

were O
reduced O
in O
the O

Introduction O
The O
leafy O
green O
vegetable O
lettuce O
(Lactuca O
sativa, O

member O
of O
the O
family O
Asteraceae, O
is O
popular O
around O
the O
world O
for O
food O
and O
feed O
purposes. O
Unfortunately, O
lettuce O
is O
sensitive O
to O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
bacterial, O
viral O
and O
fungal O
pathogens. O
The O
necrotrophic O
soil-borne O
pathogen O
Rhizoctonia O
solani O
AG1-IB O
is O
best O
known O
for O
bottom O
rot O
disease O
on O
lettuce O
1 O
. O
The O
inherent O
plant O
defence O
mechanism O
reactions O
are O
specific O
for O
pathogens O
with O
different O
lifestyles O
like O
necrotrophs, O
biotrophs O
and O
hemibiotrophs O
2 O
. O
Obligate O
biotrophic O
pathogens O
(e.g., O
Puccinia O
spp., O
Blumeria O
spp.) O
have O
coevolved O
mechanisms O
to O
maintain O
host O
viability, O
use O
nutrients O
from O
living O
cells O
and O
generally O
lack O
toxin O
production O
3 O
. O
Hemibiotrophic O
pathogens O
such O
as O
Phytophthora O
infestans O
are O
characterized O
by O
their O
capability O
to O
switch O
from O
a O
biotrophic O
lifestyle O
to O
a O
necrotrophic O
lifestyle O
4 O
. O
In O
contrast O
to O
biotrophs, O
necrotrophs O
exclusively O
extract O
nutrients O
from O
dead O
cells O
and O
have O
evolved O
aggressive O
and O
extensive O
virulence O
strategies O
that O
promote O
host O
cell O
death O
5 O
. O
Necrotrophs O
include O
host-specific O
like O
Cochliobolus O
carbonum O
and O
broad O
host-range O
species O
such O
as O
Botrytis O
cinerea, O
Sclerotinia O
sclerotiorum, O
and O
Alternaria O
brassicicola O

Regardless O
of O
the O

lifestyle, O
the O
activation O
of O
plant O
defence O
responses O
involves O
complex O
events O
on O
cellular, O
histological O
and O
molecular O
levels. O
The O
response O
of O
plants O
against O
pathogens O
generally O
operates O
at O
two O
levels. O
The O
first O
level O
is O
induced O
in O
plants O
when O
microbe O
associated O
molecular O
patterns O
(MAMPs) O
or O
damage O
associated O
molecular O
patterns O
(DAMPS) O
are O
recognized O
by O
pattern O

receptors O
(PRR) O
which O
trigger O
a O
broad-spectrum O
defence O
response O
known O
as O
pattern-triggered O
immunity O
(PTI). O

Similarly, O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
nitrate O
transporter O
gene O
NRT2.6 O
is O
induced O
after O
the O
inoculation O
of O
Arabidopsis O

by O
the O
phytopathogenic O
bacterium O
Erwinia O
amylovora O
[ O

Stripe O
rust O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
serious O
diseases O
threatening O
the O
growth O
and O
production O
of O
wheat O
worldwide. O
The O
causal O
agent, O
Puccinia O
striiformis O
f. O
sp. O
tritici O
(Pst), O
is O
a O
typical O
obligate O
biotrophic O
fungus. O
The O
nutrients O
required O
for O
the O
growth O
and O
reproduction O
of O
Pst O
come O
entirely O
from O
wheat O
via O
haustoria, O
the O
special O
fungal O
structures O
formed O
in O
the O
host O
mesophyll O
cells O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Thus, O
for O
rust O
fungi, O
uptake O
of O
sufficient O
nutrients O
is O
the O
determinant O
for O
successful O
colonization. O
Several O
genes O
related O
to O
sucrose O
transport O
and O
metabolism O
have O
been O
identified O
and O
are O
well O
documented O
[ O
15 O
– O
17 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
leaf O
nitrogen O
content O
is O
important O
for O
sustaining O
the O
stripe O
rust O
epidemics O
during O
winter O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Moreover, O
nitrogen O
availability O
in O
the O
host O
leaves O
significantly O
affected O
spore O
production O
for O
wheat O
leaf O
rust O
fungus O
[ O
19 O
], O
indicating O
a O
direct O
role O
of O
host O
nitrogen O
in O
rust O
disease. O
However, O
it O
is O
not O
well O
understood O
how O
rust O
fungi O
manipulate O
host O
nitrogen O
metabolism O
and O
acquire O
nitrogen O
from O
the O
host. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
analysed O
the O
changes O
in O
ammonium O
content O
in O
different O
tissues O
of O
wheat O
infected O
by O
stripe O
rust O
and O
identified O
an O
AMT2-type O
wheat O
gene, O
TaAMT2;3a, O
induced O
by O

infection. O
Then, O
the O
subcellular O

Of O
the O
GPACs, O
F. O

Its O
particular O

is O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
product O
of O
a O

Well O
described O
are: O
the O

the O

The O

might O
implicate O
ascending O

since O
S. O
pyogenes O
are O
often O
part O

[ O

]. O
According O
to O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
primary O
peritonitis O
caused O
by O
streptococcus, O
16% O
of O
patients O
developed O
streptococcal O
toxic O
shock O
syndrome O
(STSS) O
from O
an O
ascending O
infection O
originating O
from O
the O
vagina, O
9% O
of O
patients O
developed O
it O
from O
a O
droplet O
infection, O
6% O
of O
patients O
developed O
it O
from O
pharyngitis, O
and O
69% O
of O
patients O
developed O
it O
via O
an O
unknown O
route O
[ O
9 O
]. O
In O
our O
case, O
we O
could O
not O
determine O
the O
primary O
site O
of O
infection; O
we O
should O
have O
collected O
a O
vaginal O
culture O
to O
confirm O
whether O
the O
infection O
originated O
in O
the O
vaginal O
tract. O
For O
the O
same O
reason, O
we O
should O
have O
collected O
a O
pharynx O
culture. O

the O
transcript O

of O
PDX1.3 O
in O

PVMs O
are O
replenished O
by O

are O
phagocytic O
cells O
that O
have O
a O
close O

Because O
of O
their O
location O
in O
the O

in O
the O

PVMs O
are O

for O

There O
is O
also O
evidence O
that O
these O

may O
play O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
maintaining O

of O
the O

[ O

Previous O
studies O
with O

have O
shown O
that O

due O

on O

A O
recent O
study O
showed O
that O
bone O
marrow-derived O
PVMs O
play O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
producing O
this O
proinflammatory O
effect O
in O
the O
brain; O
these O
cells O
release O
IL-1β O
as O
a O
response O
to O
LPS O
circulating O
in O
the O

in O
the O

area, O
one O
of O
the O
circumventricular O

that O

a O
blood-brain O
barrier O
[ O

Our O
work O
supports O
the O
idea O
that O
PVMs O
are O
crucial O
for O
this O
neuroimmune O
response O
to O
systemic O
LPS O
challenge O
and O
also O
suggests O
that O
plasma O
PLG O
is O
crucial O
for O
the O
migration O
of O
PVMs O
into O
the O
brain. O
Although O
LPS O
is O
too O
large O
(50–100 O
kDa) O
to O
enter O
the O
brain O
parenchyma O
and O
directly O
activate O
microglia, O
PVMs O
exposed O
to O
LPS O
can O
penetrate O
the O
parenchyma O
and O
induce O
the O
release O
of O
interleukin O
1β O
(IL-1β) O
and O
other O
cytokines, O
thereby O
leading O
to O
microglial O
activation O
and O
an O
astrocytic O
response. O
Although O
there O
is O
a O
full O
recovery O
of O
PVMs O
to O
PBS-treated O
CTRL O
ASO O
levels O
in O
mice O
treated O
with O
PLG O
ASO O
prior O
to O
LPS O
injection, O
activation O
of O
microglia/macrophages O
and O
astrocytes O
is O
still O
increased O
compared O
to O
controls, O
indicating O
that O
PVMs O
are O
not O
fully O
responsible O
for O
the O
neuroimmune O
response O
to O
LPS. O

It O
clearly O
appears O
that O
the O
level O
of O
sHLA-G O
in O
children O
during O
the O
first O
year O
of O
life O
is O
strongly O
correlated O
with O
their O
own O
risk O
of O
malaria O
infection O
during O
the O
weeks O
following O
the O
measurement O
28 O
. O
The O
sHLA-G O
level O
of O
a O
child O
was O
also O
associated O
with O
the O
sHLA-G O
level O
of O
his O
mother O
not O
only O
at O
delivery O
28 O
but O
also O
during O
the O
overall O
pregnancy O
29 O
. O
Moreover, O
mothers O
with O
PM O
have O
a O
higher O
probability O
of O
giving O
birth O
to O
a O
child O
with O
a O
high O
level O
of O
sHLA-G O
during O
the O
first O
2 O
years O
of O
life, O
independently O
of O
the O
mothers’ O
sHLA-G O
level O
29 O
. O
Altogether, O
these O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
both O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
malaria O
infection O
during O
infancy O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
levels O
of O
sHLA-G O
in O
children O
and O
with O
the O
potential O
involvement O
of O
HLA-G O
in O
the O

described O
during O
PM. O
However, O
the O

between O
the O
mothers’ O
levels O
of O
soluble O
HLA-G O
and O
the O
risk O
of O
malaria O
for O

remained O

Here, O
our O

was O
to O
study O
the O
association O

the O

(see O

General O
overview O
of O
CLO/PXG O
functions O
in O
fungi O
The O
finding O
here O
that O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
are O
present O
in O
about O
30% O
of O
species O
in O
the O
major O
fungal O
groups O
begs O
the O
question: O
what O
is O
the O
function(s) O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
in O
Fungi O
and O
what O
is O
the O
difference O
between O
species O
that O
have O
lost O
them O
versus O
those O
that O
have O
retained O
them, O
possibly O
for O
as O
much O
as O
one O
billion O
years? O
We O
describe O
above O
new O
evidence O
that O
we O
have O
presented O
for O
some O
specific O
functions O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
that O
are O
related O
to O
processes O
involving O
oxylipin O
signalling, O
LD O
metabolism, O
and O
aflatoxicogenicity. O
However, O
it O
is O
also O
important O
to O
look O
more O
broadly O
at O
other O
possible O
functions O
of O
these O
genes, O
especially O
in O
the O
light O
of O
their O
apparent O
loss O
in O
so O
many O
fungal O
groups. O
In O
this O
regard, O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
discern O
any O
systematic O
differences O
between O
those O
fungal O
species O
that O
lack O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
versus O
those O
that O
have O
retained O
them. O
For O
example, O
when O
the O
economically O
important O
genera, O
Aspergillus O
(where O
30/54 O
genomes O
contain O
CLO/PXG O
genes), O
Penicillium O
(7 O
out O
of O
28 O
genomes) O
and O
Colletotrichum O
(13 O
out O
of O
20 O
genomes), O
are O
examined O
in O
more O
detail O
(see O
Additional O
file O
2 O
: O
Table O
S2) O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
some O
highly O
pathogenic O
species O
contain O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
while O
other O
closely O
related O
and O
similarly O
pathogenic O
species O
lack O
these O
genes. O
To O
date, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
relatively O
limited O
number O
of O
studies O
on O
the O
function O
of O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
in O
fungi O
and O
those O
studies O
that O
have O
been O
carried O
out O
have O
been O
restricted O
to O
Dikarya O
species O
(Table O

). O

To O
identify O
the O
5′-UTR O
nucleotides O
most O
relevant O
for O
the O
interaction O
with O
RssR, O
a O
reiD O
5′-UTR/RssR O
duplex O
structure O
was O
predicted, O
and O
at O
least O
seven O
potential O
binding O
regions O
between O
the O
two O
RNA-molecules O
were O
found. O
Six O
of O
them O
were O
pairwise O
mutated O
(Fig. O
6C O
), O
and O
the O
resulting O
RNA-oligonucleotides O
Mut1UTRreiD, O
Mut2UTRreiD O
and O
Mut3UTRreiD O
were O
tested O
for O
binding O
to O
RssR O
via O
SPR O
spectroscopy. O
RssR O
showed O
a O
binding O
affinity O
to O
Mut3UTRreiD O
similar O
to O
that O
to O
the O
parental O
sequences O
(9.5 O
nM), O
although O
the O
maximal O
binding O
response O
was O
two-fold O
reduced O
(Fig. O
6D O
). O
In O
contrast, O
the O
interaction O
strength O
of O
RssR O
with O
Mut1UTRreiD O
was O
strongly O
reduced O
(167 O
nM) O
due O
to O
lower O
association O
(8.2 O
× O
10 O
2 O
/M*s) O
and O
lower O
dissociation O
constants O
(1.3 O
× O
10 O
−3 O
/s). O
Furthermore, O
the O
maximal O
binding O
response O
was O
approximately O
four-fold O
reduced. O
Only O
weak O
binding O
of O
RssR O
to O
Mut2UTRreiD O
was O
observed, O
with O
an O
overall O
affinity O
of O
2.7 O
µM. O
The O
binding O
stoichiometries O
of O
a O

4:1 O
UTRreiD O
to O
RssR, O
of O
2:1 O
for O
Mut3UTRreiD O
and O
of O
1:1 O
for O
Mut2UTRreiD, O
depended O
on O
the O
maximal O
response O
of O
the O
respective O
sensorgrams, O
might O
be O
due O
to O
a O
different O
self-binding O
or O
oligomerization O
of O
the O
different O
UTRreiD O
derivatives O
or O
caused O
by O
a O
different O
number O
of O
binding O
sites O
on O
RssR O
for O
the O
respective O
UTRreiD O
derivative. O
The O
putative O
secondary O
structure O
of O
RssR O
is O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
6E O
. O
Taken O
together, O
these O
data O
strongly O
suggest O
that O
RssR O
stabilizes O
the O
mRNA O
of O
reiD O
by O
direct O
interaction. O

Three O

an O

A O

it O
can O
inhibit O
NFkappaB O
transcription O
in O
a O

67 O
. O
Finally, O
the O

showed O
similarity O
to O
the O
NRPS O
involved O
in O
biosynthesis O
of O
the O

caryoynencin, O
a O

bacteriocins, O
a O

Many O
bacteriocins O
are O
biosynthesized O

in O

these O

Several O

Indeed, O

a O

M O
(Lu O

). O
In O
Mtb O
and O
several O
closely O
related O
species, O
cyp143a1 O
is O
part O
of O
the O
esx-5 O
locus. O
Most O
genes O
of O
this O
esx-5 O
locus O
are O
coding O
for O
substrates O
or O
components O
of O
the O
ESX-5 O
protein O
secretion O
machinery. O
This O
ESX-5 O
secretion O
system O
completes O
a O
multitude O
of O
functions, O
linked O
to O
the O
many O
different O
Pro-Glu O
(PE) O
and O
Pro-Pro-Glu O
(PPE) O
protein O
substrates O
of O
the O
system. O
Some O
of O
these O
proteins O
remain O
in O
the O
cell O
envelope, O
where O
they O
are O
important O
for O
modifying O
the O
cell O
permeability O
and O
uptake O
of O
hydrophobic O
carbon O
sources O
(Abdallah O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Ates O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
In O
addition, O
Mtb O
ESX-5 O
system O
mediates O
the O
reduction O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokine O
secretion O
by O
macrophages O
and O
induces O
a O
caspase-independent O
cell O
death O
in O
macrophages O
after O

enabling O
the O
bacteria O
to O
infect O
neighboring O
cells O
(Abdallah O
et O
al. O
2008 O
, O
2011 O
). O
Also, O
ESX-5 O
components O
are O
upregulated O
during O
phosphate-limiting O
conditions O
(Elliot O
and O
Tischler O
2016 O
). O
Even O
though O
the O
specific O
role O
of O
cyp143a1 O
remains O
unclear, O
its O
association O
with O
the O
esx-5 O
locus O
may O
reflect O
a O
pivotal O
contribution O
to O
components O
of O
the O
transport O
channel. O
Furthermore, O
ESX-5 O
transposon O

in O
the O

encoding O
CYP143A1 O
Mtb O
were O
attenuated O
both O

(Bottai O

Because O
a O
large O
number O
of O
DME O
and O
inflammation-associated O
genes O
were O
surveyed, O
multivariate O
analysis O
was O
used O
for O
the O
results. O

This O
is O
not O
surprising O
since O
a O
high O
number O
of O
genes O
found O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
in O

growth O
were O
conserved O
in O
the O

genome O
of O
the O
leprosy O
bacillus, O
M. B-PATH
leprae I-PATH
(Sassetti O
et O
al. O
2003 O
). O
Even O
though O
an O
initial O
study O
indicated O
that O
cyp128a1 O
was O
among O
the O
essential O
genes O
unique O
to O
mycobacteria, O
this O
could O
not O
be O
confirmed O
in O
later O
TraSH O
studies O
(Sassetti O
et O

2003 O
; O
Lamichhane O
et O

2011 O
; O
Zhang O
et O
al. O
2012 O
; O
DeJesus O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
These O
contradictory O
results O
could O
be O
due O
to O
the O
limited O
gene O
coverage O
of O
some O
of O
the O
transposon O
libraries. O
Interestingly, O
disruption O
of O
the O
orphan O
cyp136a1 O
provided O
a O
growth O
advantage O
in O

(DeJesus O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Even O
though O
cyp121a1 O
was O
found O
to O
be O
non-essential O
in O
these O
genome-wide O
transposon O
studies, O
cyp121a1 O
could O
only O
be O
knocked O
out O
in O
Mtb O
H37Rv O
after O
creating O
a O
merodiploid O
strain. O
This O
indicates O
that O
this O
gene O
is O
required O
for O
growth O
under O
in O
vitro O
conditions O
(McLean O
et O
al. O
2008 O
). O
Transposon O

were O
also O
conducted O
on O
bacterial O
cultures O
grown O
in O
conditions O
that O
the O
bacterium O
encounters O
during O
infection O
in O
the O
human O
host. O
These O
studies O
aimed O
to O
identify O
the O
mechanisms O
used O

the O

Griffin O

Another O
interesting O
CLO/PXG-containing O
fungus O
is O
the O
basidiomycetous O

Rhodosporidium O
toruloides, O
which O
has O
biotechnological O
uses O
as O
a O
producer O
of O
carotenes O
and O
triacylglycerols. O
Although O
the O
genome O
of O
this O
species O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
fully O
sequenced, O
laboratory O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
are O
highly O
induced O
in O
response O
to O
nitrogen O

and O
that O
the O

are O
one O
of O
the O
two O
major O
components O
of O
the O
lipid O
droplet O
proteome O
[ O
11 O
]. O
Since O
the O
overexpression O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
in O
Saccharomyces O
cerevisiae O
leads O
to O
increased O
triacylglycerol O
accumulation O
[ O

, O

], O
the O
manipulation O
of O
these O

in O
other O
commercially O
useful O
lipogenic O
fungi O
could O
be O
part O
of O
a O
biotechnological O
approach O
to O
increasing O
lipid O
production O
for O
use O
in O
oleochemicals, O
foods O
or O

Given O
our O
recent O
demonstration O
of O
the O
close O
relationship O
between O

and O

[ O

], O
further O
studies O
on O
the O
wider O
roles O
of O
these O
proteins O
are O
definitely O
merited. O
In O
terms O
of O
the O
origins O
and O
current O
distribution O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
in O
eukaryotes O
we O
suggest O
that O
these O
genes O
were O
present O
in O
the O
last O
eukaryote O
common O
ancestor O
(LECA) O
that O
pre-dated O
the O
split O
into O
the O
major O
extant O
clades O
such O
as O
plants, O
fungi O
and O
Metazoa. O
The O
present O
distribution O
as O
reported O
here O
suggests O
that O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
were O
subsequently O
lost O
in O
all O
eukaryotic O
lineages O
except O
for O
the O
fungal O
and O
plant O
kingdoms. O
The O
presence O
of O
CLO/PXG O
orthologs O
in O
all O
plant O
genomes O
sequenced O
to O
date O
would O
suggest O
that O
these O
genes O
have O
important O
core O
housekeeping O
functions, O
especially O
in O
the O
land O
plants. O

This O
down-regulation O
of O
MHC O

in O
VACV-infected O
BMDC O
was O
possibly O
caused O
by O

[ O

Wang O

indicated O
that O

was O
reduced O
in O
B O
cells O
from O

to O

The O
authors O
have O
suggested O
that O
decreased O
cysteine O

expression, O
mainly O
cathepsin O
S, O
may O
be O
associated O
with O

slow O

not O

also O
to O

Conclusion O
Our O

show O
a O
profound O
down-regulation O
of O

process O
a O

these O
cDCs O
during O

Because O
this O
highly O
suggests O

cellular O
function, O
therefore O
cDCs O
may O
not O
perform O

Higher O

A O

Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
mature O
RssR O
is O
produced O
by O
processing O
of O
the O
iolB O
mRNA O
or O
of O
an O
RssR O

that O
is O

within O
the O
iolB O

region O
by O
SsrB O
and/or O
other O
regulatory O
factors, O
or O
both. O
As O
SsrB O
binding O
to O
a O
site O
within O
iolB O
might O
impair O
transcription O
of O
this O
gene, O
we O
hypothesize O
an O
only O
temporary O
interaction O
to O
stimulate O
the O
activation O
of O
the O

The O

almost O
a O

The O

not O

also O
those O

68 O
. O
The O
postulated O
binding O
of O
RssR O
by O
Hfq O
31 O
prompted O
us O
to O
study O
the O
effect O
of O
an O

on O

We O
demonstrate O
that O
in O

∆hfq O
showed O
a O
weaker O
total O
growth O
than O
strain O
14028, O
as O
similarly O
observed O
previously O
in O
minimal O
acidic O
medium, O
indicating O
that O
Hfq O
controls O
the O

69 O
. O
However, O
such O
a O
pleiotropic O
effect O
was O
not O
observed O
with O
a O
hfq O
deletion O

of O

, O
a O
distinction O
that O
might O
be O
strain-specific O
or O
due O
to O
the O
growth O
conditions. O
More O
intriguingly, O
a O
lack O
of O
Hfq O
resulted O
in O
a O
severe O
growth O
defect O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium O
in O
MM O
with O

and O
we O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
overall O
reduced O
transcription O
of O
most O
iol O
genes O
in O
the O
hfq O
mutant O
contributes O
to O
this O

Introduction O
Tuberculosis O
Tuberculosis O
(TB) O
is O
caused O
by O
the O
human O
pathogen O
Mycobacterium B-PATH
tuberculosis I-PATH
(Mtb). O
In O
2017, O
10 O
million O
new O
TB O
cases O
were O
reported O
worldwide O
and O
1.3 O
million O
people O
died O
from O
TB O
infection, O
making O
it O
the O
deadliest O
infectious O
disease O
known O
to O
humankind O
(World O
Health O
Organization O
2018 O
). O
The O
emergence O
of O
Mtb O
strains O
resistant O
to O
the O
first-line O
anti-TB O
agents, O
i.e., O
ethambutol, O
isoniazid, O
pyrazinamide, O
and O
rifampicin, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
fatal O
synergy O
with O
HIV, O
has O
prompted O
the O
development O
and O
FDA O
approval O
of O
new O
drugs O
for O
TB, O
such O
as O
bedaquiline O
and O
delamanid. O
In O
this O
context, O
the O
determination O
of O
the O
complete O
genome O
sequence O
of O
Mtb O
and O
development O
of O
genetic O
tools O
have O
been O
instrumental O
in O
uncovering O
the O
biology O
of O
this O
unconventional O
pathogen O
and O
the O
identification O
of O
novel O
drug O
targets O
(Cole O
et O
al. O
1998 O
). O
The O
mycobacterial O
genome O
encodes O
a O
large O
variety O
of O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
lipid O
biosynthesis O
and O
metabolism, O
reflecting O
its O
elaborate O
capability O
to O
use O
lipid O
metabolism O
for O
both O
energy O
homeostasis O
and O
synthesis O
of O
many O
different O
components O
of O
the O
complex O
cell O
envelope O
(Gazaei O
2018 O
). O
This O
unusual O
cell O
envelope O
is O
critical O
for O
Mtb’s O
persistence, O
providing O
not O
only O
mechanical O
strength O
and O
protection O
to O
hostile O
environments O
but O
also O
a O
barrier O
to O
the O
entry O
of O
harmful O
compounds O
(Nikaido O
and O
Jarlier O
1991 O
; O
Chiaradia O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Fortunately, O
because O
the O
mycobacterial O
cell O
envelope O
contains O
many O
unique O
structures, O
the O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
its O
biogenesis O
provide O
us O
with O
many O
Mtb-specific O
drug O
targets O
and O
thus O
the O
possibility O
to O
develop O
compounds O
that O
are O
highly O
specific O
to O
mycobacteria. O
Recent O
examples O
include O
the O
benzothiazinones O
that O
block O
arabinogalactan O
biosynthesis O
and O
delamanid O
that O
interferes O
with O
mycolic O
acid O
biosynthesis O
(Riccardi O
and O
Pasca O
2014 O
). O
Genome O
mapping O
revealed O
that O
Mtb O
encodes O
a O
high O
number O
of O
cytochrome O
P450 O
enzymes O
(CYPs O
or O
P450s). O

Recent O
study O
showed O
that O
Aβ O
may O
play O
a O
protective O
role O
in O
innate O
immunity O
and O
infectious O
or O
sterile O
inflammatory O
stimuli O
may O
drive O
amyloidosis O
and O
that O
Aβ O
oligomerization, O
a O
behavior O
traditionally O
viewed O
as O
intrinsically O
pathological, O
may O
be O
necessary O
for O
the O
antimicrobial O
activities O
of O
the O
peptide, O
which O
mean O
that O
Aβ O
serves O
to O
protect O
the O
brain O
from O
invading O
microbes O
(Kumar O
et O
al., O
2016 O
). O
In O
vitro O
study O
of O
Chlamydia O
pneumoniae O
showed O
that O
the O
infection O
of O
monocytes O
could O
stimulate O
innate O
and O
adaptive O
immune O
responses O
relevant O
to O
those O
in O
AD O
(Balin O
and O
Hudson, O
2014 O
; O
Lim O
et O
al., O
2014 O
; O
Little O
et O
al., O
2014 O
). O
Hoban O
et O
al, O
elucidated O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
microbial O
influence O
by O
investigating O
changes O
in O
the O
homeostatic O
regulation O
of O
neuronal O
transcription O
of O
germ-free O
mice O
within O
the O
prefrontal O
cortex, O
and O
showed O
that O
the O
microbiome O
is O
necessary O
for O
appropriate O
and O
dynamic O
regulation O
of O
myelin-related O
genes O
(the O
formation O
of O
fatty O
sheathing O
that O
insulates O
nerve O
fibres), O
with O
clear O
implications O
for O
cortical O
myelination O
at O
an O
ultrastructural O
level O
(Hoban O
et O
al., O
2016 O
). O
Experiments O
by O
Lee O
et O
al O
also O
showed O
that O
the O
germ-free O
mice O
were O
protected O
from O
causing O
the O
case O
experimentally, O
similar O
to O
multiple O
sclerosis, O
characterized O
by O
the O
demise O
of O
myelin, O
which O
encases O
nerve O
fibers O
(Lee O
et O
al., O
2011 O
). O
There O
is O
also O
the O
possibility O
that O
these O
hypothetical O
pathways O
are O
tangled O
and O
that O
e.g. O
Aβ O
deposits O
in O
the O
cerebrovascular O
wall O
will O
elicit O
a O
peripheral O
inflammatory O
response O
that O
will O
in O
turn O
enhance O
brain O
inflammation O

[ O

A O

suffer O
from O
insulin O

Of O

such O
as O

[ O

People O

Cognition O
Very O
few O

have O
been O
performed O
in O

One O
study O
performed O
in O

demonstrated O

in O
the O

(i.e. O
the O
“judgement O
of O

or O

[ O
80 O
]. O
Subsequent O
studies O
demonstrated O
that O
certain O
cognitive O
deficits O
appear O
relatively O
early O
in O

then O
become O
broader O
and O
more O
profound O
during O

of O
the O
disease O
[ O

In O
these O

Currently, O
26 O
species O
representing O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus O
have O
been O
described O
(Table O
1 O
). O
After O
establishment O
of O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
in O
1993, O
bacteria O
of O
the O
only O
species O
P. O
luminescens O
were O
divided O
into O
two O
groups, O
i.e. O
Heterorhabditis O
nematode O
symbionts O
and O
human O
clinical O
isolates O
(Akhurst O
et O
al. O
1996 O
). O
However, O
based O
on O
phylogenetic O
analysis O
of O
16S O
rRNA O
gene O
sequences, O
another O
two O
species O
in O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
were O
delineated O
in O
1997, O
i.e. O
Photorhabdus O
temperata O
and O
Photorhabdus O
asymbiotica O
for O
some O
nematode O
symbionts O
and O
all O
bacteria O
isolated O
from O
human O
specimens, O
respectively O
(Lie O
et O
al. O
1997; O
Fischer-Le O
Saux O
et O
al. O
1999 O
). O
Meanwhile, O
the O
stricter O
taxonomic O
system O
for O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
contributed O
to O
creation O
of O
many O
new O
taxa O
with O
a O
status O
of O
subspecies O
(e.g. O
Fischer-Le O
Saux O

; O
Tóth O
and O
Lakatos O
2008 O
; O
An O
and O
Grewal O
2010 O
, O
2011 O
). O
In O
2010, O
after O
a O
deep O
revision O
of O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
phylogeny O
based O
on O
MLSA, O
there O
were O
only O
3 O
species O
in O
this O
genus: O
P. O
luminescens, O
P. O
temperata, O
and O
P. O
asymbiotica, O
but O
they O
comprised O
9, O
6, O
and O
2 O
subspecies, O
respectively O
(Tailliez O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
The O
fourth O
species O
in O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus, O
Photorhabdus O
heterorhabditis, O
was O
described O
by O
Ferreira O
et O
al. O
( O
2014 O
) O
for O
bacterial O
symbionts O
of O
the O
nematode O
Heterorhabditis O
zealandica. O
Recently, O
based O
on O
whole-genome O
sequence O
data, O
Machado O
et O
al. O
( O
2018 O
) O
proposed O
the O
elevation O
of O
most O
Photorhabdus O
subspecies O
to O
the O
species O
level O
and O
described O
one O
novel O
species O
- O
Photorhabdus O
bodei. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
writing, O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
contained O
19 O
species, O
3 O
of O
which, O
i.e. O

that O
the O
two O

(Table O

Further, O

that O

This O

Given O
that O

it O

On O
feral O

strong O

act, O
not O
only O
by O
V. O

Being O
feral O
may, O
however, O
also O
reduce O
certain O
selection O
pressures O
in O
comparison O
to O
being O
managed O
(Loftus O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
In O
cases O
where O
the O
feral O
population O
is O
sufficiently O
isolated O
from O
managed O
colonies, O
this O
can O
lead O
to O
resistance O
(e.g. O
Seeley O
2007 O
; O
Le O
Conte O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
Often O
swarms O
from O
managed O
colonies, O
which O
become O
feral, O
soon O
die O
(Thompson O
et O
al. O
2014 O
), O
probably O
because O
those O
colonies O
do O
not O
possess O
genes O
enabling O
survival O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
mite O
treatments. O
However, O
swarms O
from O
the O
naturally O
selected O
population O
will O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
survive O
because O
they O
have O
acquired O
resilience O
to O
V. O
destructor. O
Darwin’s O
Black O
Bee O
Box O
might O
therefore O
shift O
the O
balance O
between O
managed O
and O
feral O
colonies O
by O
increasing O
the O
chances O
for O
survival O
and O
re-establishment O
of O
wild O
honey O
bee O
populations. O
DBBB O
may O
help O
the O
invasion O
of O
Varroa O
destructor O
to O
become O
a O
successful O
naturalization O
After O
an O
invasive O
species O
has O
established, O
the O
preferred O
and O
chosen O
path O
of O
targeted O
management, O
including O
control/mitigation, O
may O
become O
more O
costly O
and O
troublesome O
than O
accepting O
the O
inevitable O
fate O
that O
the O
species O
has O
become O
‘ours’ O
(Epstein O
2017 O
). O
However, O
being O
established O
also O
implies O
that O
the O
invasive O
species O
has O
become O
part O
of O
‘our’ O
nature, O
which O
also O
opens O
the O
challenge O
for O
the O
invasive O
species O
to O
adapt O
and O
fit O
in O
a O
new O
niche O
as O
a O
naturalized O
species O
(Blackburn O
et O
al. O
2011 O
). O
For O
the O
established O
invasive O
species O
V. O
destructor, O
we O
propose O
to O
gradually O
abandon O
targeted O
management O
measures O
and O
hand O
the O
initiative O
over O
to O
natural O
selection. O
We O
therefore O
call O
upon O
beekeepers O
and O
scholars O
to O
follow O
our O
Darwin’s O
Black O
Bee O
Box O
trials, O
to O
be O
started O
now O
and O
in O
the O
years O
to O
come. O
DBBB O
might O
work O
for O
other O
invasive O
parasitic O
species O
too O
Since O
evolution O
by O
natural O
selection O
is O
universal O
for O
all O
species, O
it O
seems O
evident O
that O
this O
type O
of O
approach O
could O
in O
principle O
be O
used O
for O
other O
invasive O
species O
as O
well O
(e.g. O
for O
Tropilaelaps O

al. O
2017 O
, O
and O
for O

B. O

Endophyte O

in O

43 O
. O
For O

B. O

confers O

the O

44 O
. O
Moreover, O
they O
produce O
the O

as O

which O
triggered O

In O

Hence, O

be O
a O

Thus O

Although O
both O
the O
parental O
and O
mutant O
strains O
were O
cleared O
at O
a O
very O
low O
level, O
the O
decrease O
in O
the O

of O
the O

within O

was O
gradual, O
and O
the O
number O
of O

was O
gradually O
reduced O
from O
10 O

CFU O
to O
10 O
1 O
CFU. O
However, O
there O
were O
two O
mutant O
strains O
that O
were O
both O
at O
very O
low O
levels. O
In O
particular, O
its O
colonization O
could O
not O
complete O
within O
the O

suggesting O
that O
the O
mutant O
strain O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
able O
to O
fight O
clearance O
from O
the O
immune O
system. O
Studies O
in O

suggested O
that O
rpoB O

could O
reduce O
the O
expression O
of O

Capsular O
polysaccharides O
could O
help O
the O

in O

[ O

]. O
Considering O
the O
crucial O
role O
of O
RNA O
polymerase O
in O
transcription, O
studying O
transcriptome O
changes O
in O
mutants O
would O
provide O
useful O
information. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
ability O
of O
mutants O
to O
resist O
hydrogen O
peroxide O
and O
NO O
was O
decreased O
in O
an O
in O

experiment. O
This O
result O
also O
supported O
the O
results O
of O
colonization O
experiments O
in O

Both O
active O
oxygen O
and O
reactive O
nitrogen O
in O

were O
the O
environmental O
pressures O
that O
the O
bacteria O
would O
encounter. O
The O
defense O
against O
oxidative O
stress O
was O
crucial O
for O
the O
survival O
of O
bacteria O
in O
the O
body O
[ O
36 O
]. O
So O
far, O
the O
rpoB O
mutant O
has O
not O
been O
characterized O
in O
detail O
and O
may O
lack O
sufficient O
attention. O
The O
lacking O
dose O
of O
rifampin O
in O
use O
and O
the O
residual O
drug O
in O
the O
environment O
may O
provide O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
with O
the O
stress O
condition O
required O
for O
spontaneous O
mutation. O
The O
fitness O
cost O
of O
rpoB O
mutation O
may O
be O
due O
to O
changes O
in O
gene O
transcription O
level, O
and O
transcriptome O
analysis O
of O
mutant O
strains O
will O
be O
of O
great O
value. O
Therefore, O
further O
investigation O
and O
evaluation O
are O
necessary. O
Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
R. O
anatipestifer O
rifampin O
resistance O
is O
mainly O
derived O
from O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
mutation, O
whose O
types O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
strain O
background O
and O
environment O
stress. O
The O
spontaneous O
mutation O
of O
rpoB O
gene O
is O
concentrated O
in O
the O
mutation O
type O
with O
low O
fitness O
cost. O
And O
different O
rpoB O
mutations O
confer O
different O
fitness O
costs. O

[ O

but O
several O

such O

in O
vertebrate O

also O
affect O

[ O

the O

[ O

The O
distribution O
and O

pathogens O
often O
depends O
on O
distribution O
of O

not O
just O
distribution O

the O
vector, O
and O
such O
insight O
provides O
another O
potential O

to O

Anaplasma B-PATH
phagocytophilum I-PATH
is O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
human O
granulocytic O
anaplasmosis O
[ O
8 O
], O
and O
it O
also O
causes O
disease O
and O
economic O
losses O
in O
livestock O
[ O
9 O
]. O
Tick-borne O
fever, O
caused O
by O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
is O
considered O
a O
major O
problem O
for O
livestock O
production. O
Anaplasmosis O
leads O
to O
mortality O
and O
especially O
lambs O
are O
at O

[ O

]. O
Infection O
with O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
also O
reduces O
body O
growth O
of O
lambs O
[ O

]. O
Some O
tick-borne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Borrelia O
burgdorferi O
(sensu O
lato) O
and O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
have O
a O
high O
genetic O
diversity. O
Due O
to O
the O
high O
genetic O
diversity, O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
was O
formerly O
even O
split O
in O
three O
different O
species O
[ O
12 O
]. O
This O
genetic O
diversity O
has O
probably O
arisen O
as O
a O
response O
to O
evasion O
of O
immune O
defenses O
of O
phylogenetically O
different O
vertebrate O
host O
groups O
[ O
13 O
]. O

Therefore, O
the O
selected O
rpoB O
mutations O
were O
specific O
under O
certain O
environmental O
pressures O
[ O
29 O
, O
30 O
], O
which O
also O
provided O
an O
explanation O
for O
the O
differences O
in O
detected O
rpoB O
mutations. O
Above O
all, O
the O
spontaneous O
mutation O
test O
in O
this O
study O
was O
carried O
out O
on O
solid O
medium O
without O
antibiotics O
at O
37 O
°C O
lacking O
clinically O
specific O
environmental O
pressures, O
making O
all O
mutations O
possible O
to O
survive, O
which O
had O
little O
to O
do O
with O
their O
respective O
fitness. O
Studies O
in O
F. O
psychrophilum O
suggested O
that O
strains O
under O
the O
rifampin O
pressure O
were O
prone O
to O
enrich O
more O
single-nucleotide O
polymorphism, O
which O
would O
be O
associated O
with O
weakened O

[ O

]. O
Therefore, O
the O
types O
of O
rpoB O
mutations O
obtained O
from O
spontaneous O
mutation O
tests O
were O
various, O
while O
the O
types O
identified O
in O

were O
relatively O
concentrated. O
Due O
to O
the O
frequency O
of O

gene O
mutation O
sites O
(the O
sum O
of O
different O

and O
the O
distribution, O
the O
frequency O
of O
rpoB O

in O

was O
as O
high O
as O
98.8%. O
These O

The O

The O

no O

It O
was O
worth O
noting O
that O
two O

been O
detected. O
One O
was O
the O
insertion O

primary O
cells, O
which O
are O
not O
able O
to O
reassociate O
with O
nematodes, O
can O
live O
freely O
in O
the O
rhizosphere O
(Eckstein O
et O
al. O

). O
Only O
bacteria O
of O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
are O
positive O
for O
catalase O
and O
bioluminescence, O
thus O
they O
can O
be O
easily O
differentiated O
from O
bacteria O
of O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus O
by O
these O
two O
traits. O
The O
bioluminescence O
ability O
is O
the O
most O
curious O
phenotypic O
characteristic O
of O
the O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria. O
In O
fact, O
Photorhabdus O
are O
the O
only O
known O
bioluminescent O
terrestrial O
bacteria O
that O
are O
able O
to O
produce O
light; O
however, O
the O
function O
of O
this O
trait O
in O
Photorhabdus O
is O
unclear. O
Peat O
et O
al. O
( O
2010 O
) O
showed O
a O
decline O
in O
bioluminescence O
intensity O
throughout O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria, O
supporting O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
this O
feature O
was O
acquired O
by O
their O
ancestor O
living O
in O
an O
aquatic O
environment O
but O
now O
is O
gradually O
being O
lost O
under O
terrestrial O
selection O
pressure. O
This O
agrees O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
bioluminescence O
in O
Photorhabdus O
as O
a O
non-functional O
evolutionary O
remnant O
that O
has O
not O
had O
enough O
time O
to O
be O
lost, O
as O
proposed O
earlier O
by O
Peat O
and O
Adams O
( O
2008 O
). O

comparison O

been O
frequently O

(e.g. O

Tailliez O

the O

and O

of O
EPN O

(Murfin O
et O

). O

The O
empty O

(pDR195) O
was O
used O
as O
the O
control O
To O
further O
characterize O
the O
biochemical O
function O
of O
TaAMT2;3a, O
we O
tested O
the O
ability O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O
to O
transport O
NH O
4 O
+ O
. O
The O
TaAMT2;3a O
protein O
was O
expressed O
in O
the O
yeast O
triple O
Mep O
deletion O
strain O
31019b O
(mep1, O
mep2, O
mep3, O
ura3), O
which O
is O
entirely O
defective O
in O
NH O
4 O
+ O
transport O
and O
unable O
to O
grow O
on O
medium O
containing O
&lt; O
5 O
mM O
NH O
4 O
+ O
as O
the O
sole O

[ O

]. O
The O
results O
showed O
that O
the O
yeast O
mutant O
transformed O
with O
TaAMT2;3a O
grew O
on O
medium O
containing O
1 O
or O
5 O
mM O
NH O
4 O
Cl O
as O
the O
sole O
nitrogen O
source O
(Fig. O

This O
finding O
indicates O
that O
TaAMT2;3a O
complements O
the O
NH O
4 O
+ O
uptake O
defect O
of O
31019b O
and O
is O
likely O
responsible O
for O
high-affinity O

To O

the O

gene O
in O
the O
wheat-Pst O
interaction, O
barley O
stripe O
mosaic O
virus O
(BSMV)-induced O
gene O
silencing O
(VIGS) O
was O
applied. O
Due O
to O
the O
high O
similarity O
among O
the O
three O
TaAMT2;3a O
homoeologs O
in O
the O
wheat O
A, O
B, O
and O
D O
genomes, O
two O
fragments O
were O
designed O
to O
silence O
the O
three O
homoeologs O
together O
(Additional O

: O
Figure O
S1). O
The O
silencing O
of O
the O
wheat O
phytoene O
desaturase O
gene O
(PDS) O
was O
used O
as O
the O
positive O
control O
for O
the O
gene O
silencing O
system O
to O
confirm O
whether O
the O
VIGS O
system O
functions O
correctly. O
Mild O
chlorotic O
mosaic O
symptoms O
appeared O
on O
the O
fourth O
leaves O
in O
all O
plants O
at O
10 O
days O
after O
inoculation O
with O
BSMV. O
The O
BSMV::TaPDS-inoculated O
plants O
exhibited O
strong O
photobleaching O
symptoms, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
VIGS O
system O
worked O
well O
(Fig. O
4 O
a). O

The O
sizes, O
hydrophobicity O
and O
charge O
properties O
were O
different. O
Additionally, O
the O
effects O
of O
these O
two O
point O
mutations O
on O
the O
structure O
of O
RNAP O
need O
to O
be O
further O
explored. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
MICs O
of O
overexpression O
strains O
showed O
that O
the O
resistance O
of O
five O
antibiotics, O
ampicillin, O
cefuroxime, O
erythromycin, O
ciprofloxacin O
and O
chloramphenicol, O
increased O
by O
at O
least O
4-fold. O
In O
fact, O
partial O
diploids O
of O
the O
double O
rpoB O
gene O
in O
the O
same O
cell O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
actinomycetes O
[ O
25 O
]. O
The O
presence O
of O
the O
wild-type O
and O
mutant O
rpoB O
genes O
caused O
the O
bacteria O
to O
be O
resistant O
to O
rifampin O
while O
the O
secondary O
metabolites O
pathways O
was O
altered. O
And O
the O
expression O
of O
rpoB O
allele O
was O
different O
at O
different O
growth O
stages. O
So O
far, O
there O
is O
no O
reasonable O
explanation O
for O
the O
rise O
of O
erythromycin, O
ciprofloxacin O
and O
chloramphenicol O
resistance. O
We O
tried O
to O
screen O
out O
the O
same O
spontaneous O
rpoB O
mutation O
by O
rifampin O
pressure O
in O
the O
laboratory O
to O
prove O
our O
conjecture O
that O
the O
use O
of O
rifampin O
enriched O
the O
resistant O
strains. O
The O
results, O
however, O
are O
not O
satisfactory. O
The O
differences O
in O
mutation O
types O
between O
isolates O
and O
spontaneous O
mutant O
are O
worth O
considering. O
Almost O
50% O
of O
the O
rpoB O
mutations O
were O
strain-dependent, O
and O
the O
interaction O
of O
different O
types O
of O
rpoB O
mutations O
with O
other O
genomes O
would O
affect O
transcriptional O
levels, O
resulting O
in O
varying O
levels O
of O
fitness O
costs, O
and O
thus O
affecting O
the O
viability O
of O
mutant O
strains O
[ O
26 O
]. O
The O
resistance O
levels O
of O
most O
of O
the O
isolates O
were O
relatively O
low, O
but O
the O
overexpression O
strain O
ATCC O
11845-pLMF03::rpoB O
+ O
constructed O
according O
to O
the O
type O
of O
isolates O
all O
reached O
128 O
μg/mL, O
indicating O
that O
the O
level O
of O
drug O
resistance O
conferred O
by O
the O
rpoB O
mutation O
might O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
strain O
background. O
Second, O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
biological O
evolution, O
the O
replacement O
of O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
in O
a O
strain O
was O
not O
only O
a O
mutation O
of O
one O
amino O
acid O
site. O

We O
have O
shown O
that O
meliacine O
strongly O
inhibited O
the O
replication O
of O
HSV-1 O
and O
HSV-2 O
in O
Vero O
cells O
[ O

] O
and O
exhibits O
a O
synergistic O
antiviral O
activity O
when O
combined O
with O
acyclovir O
[ O

]. O
Studies O
performed O
by O
Alché O
et O

suggested O
that O
MA O
exerts O
the O
antiviral O
action O
on O
both O
synthesis O
of O
viral O
DNA O
and O
maturation O
and O
progress O
of O
HSV-1 O
on O
Vero O
cells O
[ O

]. O
In O

studies O
have O
shown O
that O
meliacine O
prevents O
the O
development O
of O
HSV-1 O
stromal O
keratitis O
in O
mice O
[ O
8 O
, O

]. O
Likewise, O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
herpetic O
infection O
in O
female O
mice O
infected O
intravaginally O
with O
HSV-2 O
was O
also O
ameliorated O
by O
MA O
treatment O
[ O

]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
besides O
its O
broad O
effect O
of O
antiviral O
action, O
meliacine O
acts O
as O
an O
immunomodulator O
in O

agent O
inhibiting O
the O
phagocytosis O
of O
opsonized O
sheep O
erythrocytes O
and O
impairing O
the O
proliferation O
of O
spleen O
and O
lymph O
node O
T O
cells O
[ O
11 O
, O

]. O
Moreover, O
meliacine O
is O
a O
weak O
inducer O
of O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
alpha O
(TNF-α) O
in O
murine O
macrophage O
cultures O
and O
causes O
a O
synergistic O
effect O
on O
the O
production O
of O
TNF-α O
induced O
by O

]. O
Vaginal O

of O
female O
mice O
infected O
i.v. O
with O
HSV-2 O

meliacine O
contained O
an O
increased O
amount O
of O
TNF-α O
in O
comparison O
with O

an O

event, O
one O
that O
occurs O
prior O
to O
the O

In O
this O
context, O
macrophages O
play O
a O
central O
role O
in O
resistance O
of O
mice O
to O
primary O
infection O
with O
HSV-2, O
mainly, O
as O
a O
source O
of O

[ O

the O

nominated O
as O
the O
allogynogenetic O
gibel O

showed O
moderately O

We O
also O
identified O
a O
wild O
clone O
H O
as O
a O
strongly O
resistant O
clone O
[ O
29 O
]. O
Our O
results O
confirmed O
that O
the O
ability O
of O
fish O
to O
resist O
infection O
was O
strongly O
influenced O
by O
genetic O
factors O
[ O
30 O
– O
34 O
]. O
The O
first O
step O
towards O
disease-resistance O
breeding O
is O
the O
search O
for O
associations O
between O
disease O
resistance O
and O
molecular O
markers. O
Teleost O
possesses O
complicated O
innate O
immune O
network O
and O
primitive O
adaptive O
immune O
system O
[ O
35 O
– O
37 O
]. O
When O
the O
pathogen O
invaded, O
the O
innate O
immune O
system O
provides O
the O
immediate O
sensing O
and O
elimination O
of O
pathogens O
in O
a O
nonspecific O
and O
nonmemory O
manner, O
while O
the O
adaptive O
immune O

offers O
delayed O
and O
highly O
specialized O
responses O
with O
immunologic O
memory O
features O
[ O
38 O
, O

Through O
transcriptome O
analysis O
among O
control O
and O
diseased O
individuals O
from O
clone O
A O

, O
F O
and O
H, O
we O
revealed O
that O

clone O
H O
of O
gibel O

activated O
stronger O
innate O
interferon O
(IFN)-mediated O
antiviral O
response, O
while O
susceptible O
clone O
A O

lost O
the O
battle O
with O
CaHV O
and O
evidently O
induced O
apoptosis O
or O
death O
[ O

Eight O
IFN O

genes, O

those O
in O

at O

or O
3 O
days O
post O
infection O
(dpi), O
were O
identified O
as O
candidate O

genes O
[ O

]. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
gene O

changes O
in O
the O
survivors O
after O
CaHV O

particularly O
their O
differences O
of O
innate O
and O
adaptive O
immune O
system O
responses O
between O
susceptible O
clone O
and O
resistant O
clone. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
first O
confirmed O
the O
carrier O
state O
in O
survivors O
of O
three O
gibel O
carp O
clones O
after O
CaHV O

Among O
these O
strains, O
only O
one O
showed O
carbapemase O
activity O
in O
the O
modified O
carbapenem O
inactivation O
method O
test O
(data O
not O
shown), O
indicating O
other O
resistance O
genes O
not O
investigated O
may O
mediate O
the O
carbapemase O
activity. O
The O
remaining O
four O
CRKP O
may O
have O
other O
resistance O
mechanisms O
contributing O
to O
carbapenem O
resistance. O
The O
production O
of O
ESBLs O
combined O
with O
mutations O
in O
or O
loss O
of O
the O
porin O
Ompk35 O
or O
Ompk36 O
can O
be O
associated O
with O
carbapenem O
resistance O
[ O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
overexpression O
of O
efflux O
pump O
in O
strains O
may O
also O
lead O
to O
carbapenem O
resistance. O
However, O
both O
porin O
Ompk35 O
and O
Ompk36 O
were O
present O
in O
the O
other O
four O
CRKP O
strains O
with O
ESBL-positive O
in O
this O
study O
(data O
not O
shown). O
Further O
studies O
should O
be O
conducted O
to O
assess O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
mutations O
in O
strains O
isolated O
in O
the O
current O
investigation. O
This O
study O
showed O
that O
the O
ESBL-producing O
strains O
were O
prevalent O
both O
in O
medical O
and O
community O
settings. O
Previous O
studies O
by O
Zhang O
et O
al. O
[ O
35 O
] O
and O
Quan O
et O
al. O
[ O
36 O
] O
also O
reported O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
ESBL-positive O
strains O
in O
community-onset O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
ESBL O
producers O
have O
disseminated O
to O
the O
community, O
which O
poses O
a O
challenge O
to O
resistance O
control. O
Bla O
CTX-M O
was O
the O
most O
frequently O
identified O
ESBL O
gene O
among O
ESBL O
producers O
in O
our O
study. O
This O
is O
accordance O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
CTX-M O
is O
the O
most O
common O
ESBL O
genotype O
in O
China O
[ O
36 O
]. O
No O
significant O
differences O
were O
observed O
in O
the O
distribution O
of O
bla O
CTX-M O
, O
bla O
SHV O
and O
bla O
TEM O
genes O
among O
isolates O
from O
the O
three O
groups, O
suggesting O
the O
wide O
dissemination O
of O
these O
genes O
possibly O
via O
horizontal O
transfer O
in O
different O
populations. O
Interestingly, O
the O
CTX-M-1 O
variant O
was O
more O
frequently O
detected O
among O
CA O
strains O
than O
among O
nosocomial O
strains, O
whereas O
the O
CTX-M-9 O
variant O
was O
more O
common O
in O
nosocomial O
strains O
than O
in O
CA O
strains. O

Overall, O
the O
CXR O
is O
characterized O
by O
relatively O
low O
sensitivity O
in O
the O
identification O
of O
pulmonary O
alterations O
of O
COVID-19. O
As O
for O
radiological O
findings, O
according O
to O
recent O
literature O
data, O
our O
study O
described O
a O
scenario O
superimposable O
on O
the O
one O
described O
for O

the O

of O
peripherally O

in O
the O
lower O

Regarding O

with O
clinical O
symptoms O
both O
univariate O
and O
multivariate O

of O
our O

in O
the O

about O
3 O

The O

are O
known O
to O

a O
dynamic O
radiological O

The O

Serotyping O
was O
performed O
according O
to O

Susceptibility O
to O
ceftriaxone O

with O
an O

Of O
note, O
the O

The O
lack O
of O

from O
the O
side O
of O
the O

prevented O
further O

A O
mouse O
vaginal O
model O
of O
HSV-2 O
infection O
has O
been O
developed O
by O
several O
investigators O
[ O
1 O
– O

]. O
Although O
the O
degree O
of O
pathogenicity O
of O
the O
virus O
for O
mice O
is O
dependent O
on O
the O
virus O
strain O
used, O
in O
general, O
experimental O
infection O
by O
vaginal O
route O
(i.v) O
results O
in O
neurological O

which O
is O
preceded O
by O
easily O
recognizable O
symptoms O
due O
to O
inflammation O
followed O
by O
rear O

and O
death. O
This O
mouse O
model O
provides O
a O
useful O
tool O
to O
test O
the O
effect O
of O
antivirals O
against O
HSV-2 O
infection. O
Many O
studies O
have O
been O
performed O
in O
our O
laboratory O
with O
an O
antiviral O
compound O
isolated O
from O
the O
leaves O
of O
Melia O
azedarach O
L. O
named O
meliacine O
(MA). O
We O
have O
shown O
that O
meliacine O
strongly O
inhibited O
the O
replication O
of O
HSV-1 O
and O
HSV-2 O
in O
Vero O
cells O
[ O
5 O
] O
and O
exhibits O
a O
synergistic O
antiviral O
activity O
when O
combined O
with O
acyclovir O
[ O
6 O
]. O
Studies O
performed O
by O
Alché O
et O
al O
suggested O
that O
MA O
exerts O
the O
antiviral O
action O
on O
both O
synthesis O
of O
viral O
DNA O
and O
maturation O
and O
progress O
of O
HSV-1 O
on O
Vero O
cells O
[ O

]. O
In O
vivo O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
meliacine O
prevents O
the O
development O
of O
HSV-1 O
stromal O
keratitis O
in O
mice O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Likewise, O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
herpetic O
infection O
in O
female O
mice O
infected O
intravaginally O
with O
HSV-2 O
was O
also O
ameliorated O
by O
MA O
treatment O
[ O
10 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
besides O
its O
broad O
effect O
of O
antiviral O
action, O
meliacine O
acts O
as O
an O
immunomodulator O
in O
vitro O
agent O
inhibiting O
the O
phagocytosis O
of O
opsonized O
sheep O
erythrocytes O
and O
impairing O
the O
proliferation O
of O
spleen O
and O
lymph O
node O
T O
cells O
[ O

, O

]. O
Moreover, O
meliacine O
is O
a O
weak O
inducer O
of O
tumor O
necrosis O
factor O
alpha O
(TNF-α) O
in O
murine O
macrophage O
cultures O
and O
causes O

(An O

Similarly, O

exhibit O
considerable O
variation O
(Chaston O

The O

that, O

the O

Xenorhabdus O

(Tailliez O

(Spiridonov O

Studies O
have O
revealed O
that O
X. O
bovienii O

differ O
significantly O
in O
the O
genome O

strategy; O
however, O
this O
is O
related O
to O
the O

rather O
than O
the O

Since O
pathogenic O
fungi O
causing O
systemic O
mycoses O
are O
found O
in O
the O
environment, O
we O
hypothesised O
that O
outbreaks O
would O
be O
affected O
by O
geoclimatic O
factors O
such O
as O
wind, O
precipitation, O
air O
temperature, O
and O
absolute O
and O
relative O
air O
humidity. O
In O
addition O
to O
climatic O
variables, O
the O
proliferation O
of O
urban O
pigeons O
and O
bats, O
drought, O
agricultural O
activity, O
and O
the O
practice O
of O
hunting O
armadillos O
represent O
sources O
that O
contribute O
to O
the O
risk O
of O

and O
contribute O
to O
the O

of O
pathogenic O
fungi O
in O
the O
environment O
1 O
– O

. O
The O
seasonal O
timing O
of O
outbreaks O
of O
fungal O
disease O
can O
be O
linked O
to O
periods O
of O
greater O
dispersion O
by O
wind O
anomalies O
and O
the O
effect O
of O

change O
on O

Precipitation O
and O
temperature O
are O
crucial O
climatic O
variables O
for O
understanding O
the O

of O
the O

5 O
. O
Understanding O
the O
seasonal O
behavior O
of O
these O
variables O
is O
fundamental O
for O
understanding O
the O
impact O
fungal O
pathogens O
on O
human O
health. O
However, O
there O
are O
few O
studies O
focusing O
on O
correlation O
between O
environmental O
variables O
and O
hospitalization O
due O

In O
addition, O
most O
of O
them O
describe O

Abiotic O
and O
biotic O

are O
reducing O
the O

so O
breeding O

focused O
on O
the O
development O

The O

been O
relying O
on O
selection O

Stemphylium O

(SB), O
caused O
by O
the O
necrotrophic O

Stemphylium O
botryosum O
Wallr., O
is O
a O

disease O
of O
lentil O
in O
several O
lentil-producing O
countries, O
including O
Canada, O

which O

account O

This O
pathogen O
infects O
plants O
by O
airborne O
conidia O
that O
develop O
successive O
cycles O
of O
conidia O
on O

In O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
SB, O
disease O
symptoms O
manifest O
as O
tan O
to O
light O
brown O
spots O
on O
lentil O
leaves. O
As O
the O
infection O
progresses, O
those O
initial O
spots O
expand O
to O
the O
entire O
leaves, O
resulting O
in O
the O
complete O
drying O
of O
leaves O
followed O
by O
defoliation. O
In O
the O
final O
stages, O
SB O
symptoms O
are O
also O
found O
on O
stems O
and O
hamper O
nutrient O
and O
water O
transport, O
which O
eventually O
kills O
the O
host. O
The O
economic O
losses O
caused O
by O
this O
pathogen O
can O
be O
up O
to O
80% O
[ O

A O
few O
SB O

have O
been O
developed O
in O
some O
of O
the O
lentil-producing O
regions, O
especially O
in O
Bangladesh O
(reviewed O

Studies O
in O

Our O

We O

Since O
it O
was O
initially O
believed O
that O
these O
bacteria O
were O
not O
able O
to O
establish O
symbiosis O
with O
nematodes, O
the O
new O
species O
created O
for O
them O
was O
named O
P. O
asymbiotica O
to O
emphasize O
this O
feature O
(Fischer-Le O
Saux O
et O
al. O
1999 O
). O
However, O
in O
2006, O
symbionts O
of O
the O
clinical O
Photorhabdus O
strain, O
i.e. O
heterorhabditid O
nematodes, O
were O
described O
and O
classified O
as O
Heterorhabditis O
gerrardi O
(Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2004 O
; O
Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
Plichta O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
Thus, O
it O
is O
now O
accepted O
that O
human O
pathogenic O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
are O
able O
to O
form O
a O
mutualistic O
relationships O
with O
Heterorhabditis O
nematodes O
to O
infect O
insects O
efficiently, O
like O
other O
Photorhabdus O
nematode O
symbionts. O
Currently, O
two O
species: O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
comprise O
both O
clinical O
and O
entomopathogenic O
Photorhabdus O
strains O
derived O
from O
various O
locations O
(Kuwata O
et O
al. O
2008 O
; O
Thanwisai O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
To O
address O
the O
particular O
life O
style O
of O
Photorhabdus O
human O
pathogens, O
their O
diversity O
and O
evolutionary O
relationships O
have O
been O
intensively O
explored O
by O
implementing O
whole O
genome O
sequencing O
and O
transcriptomic O
analysis. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
bacteria O
have O
a O
relatively O
small O
genome, O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
P. O
luminesces O
(the O
closest O
relative), O
and O
display O
lower O
diversity O
of O
insecticidal O
toxins. O
The O
existence O
of O
many O
supplementary O
plasmids O
and O
pathogenicity O
islands O
in O
the O
genome O
has O
also O
been O
shown O
(Wilkinson O
et O
al. O
2009 O
, O
2010 O
). O
Current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
switch O
of O
these O
bacteria O
from O
nematodes O
to O
humans O
was O
facilitated O
by O
virulence O
genes O
(necessary O
for O
insect O
host O
infection) O
already O
present O
in O
the O
genome, O
as O
well O
as O
additional O
virulence O
factors O
(appropriate O
for O
infection O
of O
mammalian O
cells) O
acquired O
by O
horizontal O
transfer O
from O
other O
human O
pathogens O
(Hapeshi O

Most O
amphibian O

(Beck O

In O

specific O

factors O
(e.g., O

factors O
(e.g., O
poor O

Reinfection O

we O

Thus, O
the O

Although O

(IIEG O

some O

Knowledge O

Parents O

transmit O
traditional O

knowledge O
to O
their O
children O
through O

Children O
are O
taught O
to O
collect O
mushrooms O
in O
the O

who O
show O
them O
the O

found O
and O
teach O
them O
which O

(Fig. O

). O
Children O
are O
not O
prevented O
from O
touching O
mushrooms, O
even O
the O
ones O
that O
may O
be O
toxic. O
Rather, O
adults O
simply O
tell O
children O
which O

cannot O
be O
eaten, O
and O
these O

valued O

traditional O
mycological O
knowledge O
and O
did O
not O
wish O
this O
to O
be O
lost O
within O
their O
families. O
However, O
they O
often O
felt O
that O
younger O
people O
did O
not O
share O
the O
same O
interest O
in O
learning O
about O
mushrooms O
as O
when O
they O
were O
young O
or O
that O
young O
people O
underestimated O
the O
value O
of O
wild O
resources. O
Traditional O
knowledge O
is O
being O
lost O
as O
result O
of O
economic O
changes, O
modernization, O
urbanization, O
and O
even O
formal O
education. O
We O
found O
these O
factors O
were O
leading O
to O
a O
cultural O
change O
and O
a O
lack O
of O
interest O
among O
the O
new O
generation O
in O
natural O
resources O
and O
traditional O
knowledge O
as O
already O
recognized O
elsewhere O
(Saynes-Vásquez O
et O

2013 O
). O
Toxic O
mushrooms O
The O
preservation O
of O
traditional O
mycological O
knowledge O
is O
fundamental O
to O
avoiding O
poisonings O
(Ruan-Soto O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
Mushroom O
poisonings O
or O
mycetisms O
were O
uncommon O
in O
this O
municipality O
because O
people O
only O
trusted O
mushrooms O
they O
know O
and O
transmitted O
the O
knowledge O
required O
to O
recognize O
edible O
versus O
toxic O
mushroom. O
Thus, O
they O
only O
trusted O
mushrooms O
that O
had O
been O
consumed O
for O
several O
generations. O
The O
municipal O
health O
centres O
did O
not O
have O
any O
official O
records O
of O
intoxication O
as O
a O
result O
of O
mushroom O
consumption. O
The O
mestizos O
considered O
all O
coprophilous O
mushrooms O
and O
all O
species O
with O
black O
gills O
or O
scales O
to O
be O
toxic. O

Interestingly, O
from O
the O
geographical O
map O
of O
patients O
(Fig. O

the O

Additionally, O

and O
these O
two O

This O

Recently, O
whole-genome O
analyses O
increasingly O
support O
studies O
on O
the O
diversity, O
biology, O
and O
evolutionary O
relationships O
of O
EPN O
bacteria O
(Murfin O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
Indeed, O
consideration O
of O
full O
genome O
sequences O
of O
different O
EPN O
microsymbionts O
has O
uncovered O
the O
large O
genomic O
divergence O
among O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
(Wilkinson O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Chaston O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Murfin O
et O
al. O
2015a O
). O
It O
is O
now O
clear O
that O
the O
genomes O
of O
EPN O
bacteria O
encode O
diverse O
antibiotics, O
adhesins, O
hemolysins, O
proteases, O
and O
lipases, O
which O
are O
crucial O
for O
successful O
host O
invasion O
and O
bioconversion O
of O
the O
insect O
cadaver O
(Bode O
2009 O
). O
In O
fact, O
analysis O
of O
the O
P. O
luminescens O
TT01 O
genome O
revealed O
that O
nearly O
6% O
of O
the O
genome O
sequences O
encode O
secondary O
metabolites, O
highlighting O
the O
potential O
of O
these O
bacteria O
for O
discovery O
of O
new O
drugs O
(Duchaud O
et O
al. O
2003 O
). O
Studies O
have O
established O
that O
many O
virulence O
genes O
of O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
are O
located O
within O
pathogenicity O
islands, O
probably O
acquired O
by O
extensive O
horizontal O
transfer O
(Waterfield O
et O
al. O
2002 O
; O
Duchaud O
et O
al. O
2003 O
; O
Chaston O
et O
al. O
2011 O
). O
Genes O
coding O
for O
insecticidal O
toxins O
and O
host-induced O
stress O
protection O
are O
regarded O
to O
be O
conserved, O
in O
contrast O
to O
genes O
involved O
in O
production O
of O
antimicrobial O
molecules O
limiting O
the O
growth O
of O
competitors, O
which O
appear O
to O
be O
highly O
diverse O
among O
EPN O
bacteria, O
even O
within O
a O
single O
population O
(An O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Meli O
and O
Bashey O
2018 O
). O
Similarly, O
genes O
involved O
in O
mutualistic O
associations O
of O
the O
bacteria O
with O
nematodes O
exhibit O
considerable O
variation O
(Chaston O
et O
al. O
2011 O
). O
The O
studies O
reviewed O
above O
suggest O
that, O
despite O
the O
close O
phylogenetic O
relationships O
and O
similar O
lifestyle, O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
under O
different O
evolutionary O
pressures O
exerted O
by O
their O
two O
animal O
hosts O
as O
well O
as O
the O
environment O
(especially O
competitors) O
have O
developed O
a O
great O
number O
of O
different O
ways O
of O
interacting O
with O
nematodes, O
which O
is O
an O
example O
evolutionary O
convergence. O

As O
shown O
previously, O
CD3/28 O
stimualtion O
upregulated O
the O
expression O
of O
all O
other O
metabolic O
proteins, O
whereas O
2-FDG O
combined O
with O
CD3/28 O
treatment O
reduced O

with O

indicating O
partial O
dependence O
on O
glycolysis O
(Fig. O

, O
Supplementary O

). O
Taken O
together, O
this O
indicates O
a O
heavy O
reliance O
on O

for O
metabolic O

during O
T-cell O

showing O
that O

could O
be O
possibly O
corroborated O
to O
the O
involvement O
of O

pathway O
in O
tomato O
after O
XCV. O
Most O
significant O
upregulation O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
transcript O
profile O
of O
PDX1.3, O
which O
showed O
more O
than O
12-fold O
increase O
in O
expression O
at O
72 O
hpi. O
We O
also O
found O
significant O
up O

of O

which O
were O
3.054- O
and O
3.44-fold, O
respectively, O
at O

hpi. O
From O
our O
results, O
we O
can O
clearly O
infer O
that O
SOS4 O

has O
not O
been O
significant. O
Increased O
expression O
of O
PDX1.3, O
PDX1.3, O
and O
PDX2 O

in O
our O
study O
proves O
that O
B. O

has O
roles O
in O
balancing O
the O
VitB6 O
biosynthesis. O
The O
previous O
study O
also O
showed O
that O
in O

thaliana, O
PDX2 O

. O
This O
possibly O
explains O
that O
de O
novo O
pathway O
predominates O
over O
the O
salvage O
pathway O
having O
mechanisms O
as O
a O
bypass. O
The O
absence O
of O
a O
salvage O
pathway O
may O
be O
due O
to O
a O
demarcated O

as O
that O
of O
the O
non-native O
pathway. O
In O
a O

This O
is O
unsurprising, O
given O
that O
context O
and O
environment O
can O
influence O
behaviour. O
The O
demographic O
differences O
between O
people O
with O
and O
without O
internet O
access O
may O
be O
particularly O
stark O
in O
developing O
countries, O
and O
so O
online O
sampling O
may O
not O
be O
the O
most O
suitable O
way O
to O
reach O
diverse O
populations O
in O
those O
countries O
(Batres O
and O
Perrett O
2014 O
), O
and O
in O
some O
instances O
of O
course O
internet O
access O
can O
contribute O
to O
behaviour O
that O
we O
might O
want O
to O
assess; O
for O
example, O
media O
exposure O
appears O
to O
explain O
differences O
in O
preferences O
for O
faces O
and O
body O
types O
(Boothroyd O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
However, O
despite O
the O
differences O
between O
online O
and O
offline O
samples, O
one O
should O
not O
be O
seen O
as O
the O
poor O
cousin O
of O
the O
other; O
both O
have O
strengths O
and O
can O
be O
used O
in O
complementary O
fashion O
to O
rigorously O
test O
inferences. O
Implications O
of O
Relying O
on O
Restricted O
Samples O
From O
a O
statistical O
point O
of O
view, O
restricted O
sampling O
can O
lead O
to O
selection O
bias O
which O
in O
turn O
can O
lead O
to O
confounding O
(Bareinboim O
and O
Pearl O
2012 O
; O
Elwert O
and O
Winship O
2014 O
; O
Fiedler O
2000 O
; O
Rohrer O
2018 O
). O
Recently, O
statisticians O
have O
more O
explicitly O
defined O
the O
conditions O
under O
which O
causal O
inferences O
can O
be O
made O
when O
combining O
data O
under O
heterogeneous O
conditions O
(Bareinboim O
and O
Pearl O
2016 O
). O
Depending O
on O
the O
type O
of O
inference O
researchers O
want O
to O
make, O
they O
could O
face O
confounding, O
sampling O
bias, O
or O
transportability O
bias. O
Importantly, O
these O
issues O
apply O
to O
both O
the O
decision O
to O
focus O
on O
(for O
example) O
a O
WEIRD O
population O
as O
well O
as O
expanding O
the O
research O
to O
non-WEIRD O
populations. O
An O
exclusive O
focus O
on O
restricted O
samples O
comes O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
external O
validity. O
In O
medical O
research, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
repeated O
call O
to O
revalue O
external O
validity O
(e.g. O
Burchett O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Green O
and O
Glasgow O
2006 O
; O
Steckler O
and O
McLeroy O
2008 O
). O
While O
there O
had O
previously O
been O
a O
strong O
focus O
on O
internal O
validity, O
for O
example, O
focussing O
on O
questions O
such O
as O
whether O
confounding O
can O
be O
effectively O
ruled O
out O
in O
randomised O
controlled O
trials, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
call O
to O
also O
remember O
the O
importance O
of O
external O
validity O
(can O
we O
generalise O
the O
findings O
from O
this O
trial?). O

Discussion O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
exposure O
of O
weanling O
mice O
to O
RSV O
followed O
by O
Ova O
does O
not O
lead O
to O
(AHR) O
or O
pulmonary O
pathologies O
greater O
than O
that O
induced O
by O
Ova O
sensitization O
and O
challenge O
alone. O
In O
contrast, O
exposure O
of O
weanling O
mice O
to O
Ova O
followed O
by O
RSV O
infection O
leads O
to O
long-term O
pulmonary O
consequences O
at O
the O
pathophysiological O
level. O
RSV O
infection O
of O
weanling O
mice O
(unless O
accompanied O
by O
Ova O
sensitization O
and O
challenge) O
was O
unable O
to O
induce O
significant O
histopathologies O
or O
AHR. O

Normal O
splicing O
was O
confirmed O
(Fig. O
1 O
b). O
Furthermore, O
both O
alleles O
were O
detected O
in O
similar O
proportions O
on O
the O
chromatogram, O
indicating O
that O
the O
mutant O
allele O
is O
not O
degraded. O
Thus, O
the O
c.308G O
&gt; O
A O
mutation O
does O
not O
have O
a O
detrimental O
impact O
on O
mRNA O
splicing O
or O
stability. O
Taken O
together, O
results O
from O
Polr3a O
G672E/G672E O
and O
Polr3b O
+/R103H O
mice O
may O
suggest O
that O
human O
missense O
mutations O
in O
Polr3a O
and O
Polr3b O
can O
have O
no O
impact O
in O
mice O
or O
lead O
to O
early O
developmental O
arrest. O
We O
previously O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
POLR3A O
G672E O
mutation O
has O
a O
mild O
impact O
on O
Pol O
III O
function O
in O
human O
cells, O
since O
it O
does O
not O
impair O
Pol O
III O
complex O
assembly O
or O
nuclear O
import O
and O
only O
leads O
to O
a O
mild O
decrease O
in O
POLR3A O
occupancy O
at O
target O
loci O
[ O

]. O
Considering O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
Polr3b O
R103H O
mutation O
in O
mice, O
we O
hypothesized O
that O
this O
mutation O
would O
have O
a O
more O
detrimental O
effect O
on O
Pol O
III O
function. O
To O
test O
this O
hypothesis, O
FLAG-tagged O
versions O
of O
the O
wild-type O
(WT) O
or O
mutant O
(R103H) O
forms O
of O
POLR3B O
were O
transiently O
expressed O
in O
HEK293 O
cells. O
Whole O

extracts O
were O

purified O
using O
an O
anti-FLAG O
antibody O
and O
analyzed O
by O
label-free O
shotgun O

(AP-MS). O

Importantly, O

that O
if O

inhibit O
HIV O
protease O
activity, O
it O
might O
prevent O
the O

and O
therefore O
would O
potentially O
prevent O
viral O

Our O

revealed O
evident O
co-localization O

with O

Although O
the O
distribution O
of O
cathepsin O
B O
was O
significantly O
reduced O
at O
each O
time O
point O
of O
infection, O
we O
did O
not O
observe O
co-localization O
between O
this O
protease O
and O
viral O
factories O
in O

Fiegl O
and O

[ O

have O
observed O
significant O

D O
in O

Moreover, O

that O

decreased O

cells, O
suggesting O
a O
crucial O
role O
of O
these O

in O
efficient O
processing O

chlamydial O

Moreover, O
degradation O

Chlamydia O

associated O
with O
the O
generation O

bacterial O
epitopes O
for O

compared O
with O

Probably, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
cathepsin O
B O
the O
fusion O
of O
lysosomes O
with O
F. O
novicida O
was O
intensified O
in O

Additionally, O
it O
has O

that O
bacteria O
might O
require O

to O
gain O

This O
hypothesis O

supported O
by O

ammonium O
contents O

first O

on O
the O

AMT2-type O

Our O
results, O
together O
with O
the O

suggest O
that O
the O
coordination O
between O
ammonium O

helps O

However, O
how O

Conclusions O
The O

that O
during O

the O

The O

are O
almost O

to O
the O

An O
exception O
is O
the O
transmembrane O

protein O
tyrosine O

The O
enrichment O
of O
this O

appears O
to O
be O
caused O
by O
the O
large O
cluster O
of O
down-regulated O
R-gene O

featuring O

related O
functions, O
that O
were O
differentially O

in O
our O

Among O
the O

up-regulated O
GO O

we O
found O
GOs O
related O
to O
phenylpropanoid, O
chitin, O
and O

responses O
to O

and O

(SAR). O
Additionally, O

related O
to O
the O
plant O

JA, O

ABA O
and O

are O
enriched O
in O
both O

Although O
it O
may O
be O
suggested O
that O
these O
GOs O
are O
part O
of O
a O
universal O

towards O
fungal O

It O
should O
be O
kept O
in O
mind O
that O
both O

Transcription O

Recently O
Kouzai O

reported O
on O
the O

of O
Salicylic O

resistance O
of O
Oryza O

(rice) O
and O
Brachypodium O

towards O

suggesting O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
pseudo O
biotrophic O
phase O
during O
the O
interaction O
with O
these O
two O

species. O
The O
importance O
of O

plant O
defences O
against O
R. O
solani O
was O
further O
underlined O
by O
Genzel O
et O

65 O
. O
Interestingly, O
no O
enriched O
GO O
terms O
related O
to O
SA O

were O
found O
to O
be O
enriched O
in O
our O
dataset. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
we O
observed O
induction O
of O
genes O
that O
might O
trigger O
fine-tuning O
of O
the O
hormonal O
balance O
between O
SA O
and O
JA. O
For O
example, O
a O
putative O
transcript O
for O
Jasmonate O
Resistant O
1 O
(JAR1) O
was O
continuously O
lower O
abundant O
during O
the O
interaction O
(TCONS_00020356_g.23215). O
JAR1 O
belongs O
to O
the O
group O
of O
auxin O
responsive O
genes O
and O
synthesizes O
jasmonate-isoleucine, O
the O
most O
active O
form O
of O
JA. O

Similarly, O
genes O
involved O
in O
mutualistic O
associations O
of O
the O
bacteria O
with O
nematodes O
exhibit O
considerable O
variation O
(Chaston O
et O
al. O
2011 O
). O
The O
studies O
reviewed O
above O
suggest O
that, O
despite O
the O
close O
phylogenetic O
relationships O
and O
similar O
lifestyle, O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
under O
different O
evolutionary O
pressures O
exerted O
by O
their O
two O
animal O
hosts O
as O
well O
as O
the O
environment O
(especially O
competitors) O
have O
developed O
a O
great O
number O
of O
different O
ways O
of O
interacting O
with O
nematodes, O
which O
is O
an O
example O
evolutionary O
convergence. O
Xenorhabdus O
bovienii O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
most O
diverse O
species O
among O
EPN O
bacteria; O
nevertheless, O
genomic O
studies O
confirmed O
its O
species O
status O
according O
to O
the O
current O
taxonomic O
criteria O
(Tailliez O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Murfin O
et O
al. O
2015b O
). O
Unlike O
other O
EPN O
bacteria O
spp., O
X. O
bovienii O
is O
a O
mutualist O
of O
several O
Steinernema O
spp. O
belonging O
to O
two O
distant O

clades O
(Table O

) O
(Spiridonov O
et O
al. O
2004 O
; O
Nadler O
et O
al. O
2006 O
). O
Studies O
have O
revealed O
that O
X. O
bovienii O
strains O
differ O
significantly O
in O
the O
genome O
content O
and O
fitness O
strategy; O
however, O
this O
is O
related O
to O
the O
diversity O
of O
bioactive O
molecules O
and O
their O
regulation O
rather O
than O
the O
use O
of O
different O
mechanisms O
for O
mutualistic O

with O
the O

(Murfin O

; O
Bisch O
et O

Moreover, O
analysis O
of O
the O
multiple O
genomes O
of O
X. O
bovienii O
as O
well O
as O
other O
EPN O
microsymbionts O
has O
supported O
their O
ecotype O
model O
of O
speciation. O
The O
ecotype, O
recognizing O
specific O
relationships O
between O
genes O
and O
the O
environment, O
is O
generally O
defined O
as O
an O
evolutionarily O
distinct O
group O
of O
strains O
within O
bacterial O
species O
that O
play O
a O
discrete O
ecological O
role O
(Koeppel O
et O

2008 O
). O

Yet, O
no O
direct O
functional O
association O
has O
been O
reported O
between O
cyp130a1 O
and O
Rv1258c. O
Recently, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
CYP130A1 O
can O
catalyze O
the O
N-demethylation O
of O
dextromethorphan O
yielding O
3-methoxymorphinan O
(Fig. O
1 O
) O
(Ortega O
Ugalde O
et O
al. O
2018b O
). O
Although O
dextromethorphan O
cannot O
be O
considered O
a O
physiological O
substrate O
for O
this O
enzyme, O
it O
does O
provide O
a O
starting O
point O
for O
(1) O
the O
identification O
of O
bacterial O
reactions O
CYP130A1 O
may O
catalyze O
and O
(2) O
the O

Nevertheless, O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
comprehensive O
data O
on O
the O
impact O
of O
CYP130A1 O
on O
Mtb O
virulence, O
its O
potential O
as O
a O

remains O
to O

determined. O
CYP139A1: O
a O
possible O

enzyme O
CYP139A1 O
(Rv1666c) O
is O

such O
as O
M. O

(Mb1694c), O
and O
M. O

and O
a O

Polyketides O
are O
lipid-like O

that O
are O
smaller O

have O
potent O
biological O
activities, O
such O
as, O
antibiotic O
(erythromycin), O
immunosuppressant O
(rapamycin), O
and O
antifungal O
(amphotericin O

In O
Mtb, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
PKS-encoding O
genes O
have O
been O
linked O
to O
specific O
biosynthetic O
pathways O
required O
for O
the O

components O
of O
the O

Cleaning O
also O
removes O
sufficient O
numbers O

for O
those O
who O
touch O

the O
object O
[ O
3 O
, O

]. O
In O
addition, O
it O
has O
been O
highlighted O
as O
a O
serious O
responsibility O
and O
a O
critical O
factor O
in O
the O
battle O
against O
HAIs O
[ O

]. O
Disinfection O
is O
thermal O
or O
chemical O
destruction O
of O
most O
pathogenic O
and O
other O
types O
of O
microorganisms, O
but O
not O
all O
bacterial O
spores O
[ O
3 O
, O

]. O
Whereas O
sterilization O
destroys O
all O
microorganisms O
(bacteria, O

including O
bacterial O
endospores O
from O
inanimate O

by O

chemical O
sterilants O
or O

[ O

]. O
In O
this O
regard, O
strict O
compliance O
with O
the O
recommended O
decontamination O
process O
at O
all O
level O
is O
required O
[ O
9 O
– O
12 O
]. O
Since O
failure O
to O
properly O
disinfect O
or O
sterilize O
equipment O
carries O
not O
the O
only O
risk O
associated O
with O
a O
breach O
of O

but O
also O
the O
risk O
for O
person-to-person O
transmission O
(e.g., O
hepatitis O
B O
virus) O
and O
transmission O
of O
environmental O
pathogens O
(e.g., O
Pseudomonas B-PATH

[ O

]. O
In O
Ethiopia, O
rigorous O
decontamination O
of O

medical O
equipment O
is O
an O
important O
part O
of O
infection O
prevention O
and O
patient O
safety O
strategy O
[ O

However, O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
effort O
have O
not O
been O
felt O
across O
the O
country O

have O
shown O
that O

sub-optimal O
infection O

in O
Ethiopia O
[ O
10 O
, O

In O
addition, O

is O
reported O
[ O

Moreover, O
concerns O
have O
been O
raised O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
HAIs O
[ O
17 O

Similarly, O
the O
reduction O
of O
mRNA O
expression O
for O
Cstb O
and O

at O

was O
also O
significant O
(p O

in O

Furthermore, O
the O

Ctsb, O

Ctss, O
Cstb O

were O
also O
decreased O
at O

but O
the O

was O
the O
most O

(Fig. O

In O

the O

From O
the O
392 O
different O
vernacular O

recorded O
in O
this O
study, O
20 O
appear O
repeatedly. O
Only O
six O
of O
them O
refer O
to O
the O

species, O
thus O
showing O
a O
lack O
of O
overlap O
between O
Hmong O
names O
and O
botanically O
defined O
species. O
Hmong O
plant O

comparison O
(comparison O

was O

performed O

more O
than O

[ O

]. O
In O
both O
cases, O
the O
percentage O
of O
names O
overlapping O
for O
the O
same O
species O
was O
small, O
as O
for O
a O
given O
species O
less O
than O
half O
of O
the O

were O
similar O
(44% O
when O
comparing O
between O

collected O
in O
this O
study O
and O
46% O
if O
comparing O
with O
the O
literature). O
Moreover, O
poor O
plant O

was O
also O
observed O
within O
the O
same O
areas: O
in O
Ban O
Tup, O
a O
compact O
village O
of O
49 O
households, O
ten O
species O
were O
collected O
in O
duplicates, O
of O
which O
seven O
bear O
different O

within O
Nongpet O
district, O
four O
species O
collected O
in O
duplicates O
were O
shown O
to O
us O
under O
different O

In O
general, O
a O
first O
examination O
of O
both O
uses O
and O
plant O
name O
overlapping O
seems O
to O
indicate O
a O
strong O
heterogeneity O
in O
practices O
and O
knowledge. O
The O
same O
observations O
were O
made O
by O
Anderson O
(1983) O
when O
working O
in O
hill O
tribes O
of O
northern O
Thailand, O
stating O
that O
“In O
fact O
plant O
use, O
both O
within O
a O

and O
amongst O

is O
surprisingly O
inconsistent. O
Two O
evident O
exceptions O
are O
the O
introduced O
plant O
Eupatorium O

(anti-haemorrhagic) O
and O
Aloe O

(burns)” O
(p. O

This O
affirmation O
was O
corroborated O

by O

(1986): O
“Hmong O

Whether O

The O

Meanwhile, O
the O

Both O

This O

that O

The O

in O

suggest O
that O
these O

The O
function O
of O
these O

The O

anti-TB O
agents, O
i.e., O
ethambutol, O
isoniazid, O
pyrazinamide, O
and O

as O
well O
as O
the O
fatal O
synergy O

has O
prompted O
the O
development O
and O
FDA O
approval O
of O
new O
drugs O
for O
TB, O
such O
as O
bedaquiline O
and O

In O
this O
context, O
the O
determination O
of O
the O
complete O
genome O
sequence O
of O
Mtb O
and O
development O
of O
genetic O
tools O
have O
been O
instrumental O
in O
uncovering O
the O
biology O
of O
this O
unconventional O
pathogen O
and O
the O
identification O
of O
novel O
drug O
targets O
(Cole O
et O
al. O
1998 O
). O
The O
mycobacterial O
genome O
encodes O
a O
large O
variety O
of O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
lipid O
biosynthesis O
and O
metabolism, O
reflecting O
its O
elaborate O
capability O
to O
use O
lipid O
metabolism O
for O
both O
energy O
homeostasis O
and O
synthesis O
of O
many O
different O
components O
of O
the O
complex O
cell O
envelope O
(Gazaei O
2018 O
). O
This O
unusual O
cell O
envelope O
is O
critical O
for O
Mtb’s O
persistence, O
providing O
not O
only O
mechanical O
strength O
and O
protection O
to O
hostile O
environments O
but O
also O
a O
barrier O
to O
the O
entry O
of O
harmful O
compounds O
(Nikaido O
and O
Jarlier O
1991 O
; O
Chiaradia O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Fortunately, O
because O
the O
mycobacterial O
cell O
envelope O
contains O
many O
unique O
structures, O
the O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
its O
biogenesis O
provide O
us O
with O
many O
Mtb-specific O
drug O
targets O
and O
thus O
the O
possibility O
to O
develop O
compounds O
that O
are O
highly O
specific O
to O
mycobacteria. O
Recent O
examples O
include O
the O
benzothiazinones O
that O
block O
arabinogalactan O
biosynthesis O
and O
delamanid O
that O
interferes O
with O
mycolic O
acid O
biosynthesis O
(Riccardi O
and O
Pasca O
2014 O
). O
Genome O
mapping O
revealed O
that O
Mtb O
encodes O
a O
high O
number O
of O
cytochrome O
P450 O
enzymes O
(CYPs O
or O
P450s). O
CYPs O
are O
haem-containing O
monooxygenase O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
lipid O
and O
steroid O
metabolism O
in O
eukaryotes. O
In O
fungi, O
several O
CYPs O
are O
already O
validated O
drug O
targets. O
An O
example O
is O
CYP51, O
the O
fungal O
sterol-14α-demethylase O
involved O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
membrane O
sterols. O

To O
confirm O
this O
smell, O
butyrate O
was O
added O
to O
MM O
medium O
as O
sole O
carbon O
source O
to O
test O
its O
effect O
to O
fungal O
growth. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
mutant O
growth O
and O
conidiation O
were O
obviously O
inhibited O
by O
butyrate O
as O
sole O
carbon O
source O
( O
Figs O
3a O
and O
S9a), O
which O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
effect O
when O
growing O
on O
CM O
medium. O
Furthermore, O
the O
conidial O
production O
of O
Guy11 O
was O
also O
obviously O
reduced O
when O
growing O
on O
butyrate O
as O
sole O
carbon O
source O
( O
Fig. O
S9b O
). O
Therefore, O
it O
can O
be O
concluded O
that O
the O
impact O
of O
excessive O
fatty O
acids O
on O
mutant O
conidiation O
appears O
to O
mainly O
result O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
butyrate. O
These O
results O
also O
suggested O
growth O
and O
conidiation O
of O
M. O
oryzae O
could O
be O
impacted O
by O
excessive O
fatty O
acids. O
Although O
the O
conidial O
germination O

was O
normal, O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
failed O
to O
cause O
disease O
on O
barley O
and O
rice O
( O
Fig. O

). O
But O
unlike O
its O
effect O
on O
improving O
mutant O
growth O
and O
conidiation, O
exogenous O
NaAC O
could O
not O
rescue O
the O
mutant O
pathogenicity O
defect O
( O
Fig. O

), O
which O
implied O
the O
fatty O
acid O
metabolism O
disorder O
was O
not O
the O
only O
defect O
in O
the O
mutants. O
As O
turgor O

serves O
as O
direct O
force O
for O
penetration O
7 O
, O
the O
reduced O

in O

− O
and O
their O
different O

on O

further O
confirmed O
the O
importance O
of O
turgor O
to O
host O
penetration O
( O
Figs O

and O

Melanin O
biosynthesis O
is O
also O
essential O
for O
appressorium-mediated O
penetration O
by O
keeping O
high O
turgor O
in O
M. O
oryzae O
12 O
. O
Here, O
we O
discovered O
melanin O
biosynthesis O
was O
impacted O
by O
ETF O
mutation O
by O
displaying O
a O
reduced O
melanin O
layer O
in O
mutant O
etfb O
− O
( O
Fig. O

). O
This O
result O
also O
corresponded O
to O
the O
white O
pigmentation O
of O
mutant O
colonies O
growing O
on O
CM O
culture. O
Thus O
we O
conclude O
that O
the O
low O
penetration O
rate O
of O
ETF O
mutant O
etfb O
− O
on O
host O
surface O
was O
due O
to O
a O
reduced O
appressorium O
turgor O
which O
was O
caused O
by O
the O
thin O
melanin O
layer. O

The O

Ecotype B-PATH

this O

is O
linked O
to O
a O
wide O

Both O
ecotypes O
are O

However, O

This O

involves O
a O
shift O
into O
the O
distribution O
range O
of O
another O
community O
of O
mammals O
compared O
to O
continental O
Europe. O

Seventy O
percent O
of O
samples O
were O
sourced O
online O
or O
from O
student O
populations. O
Asian O
samples O
mainly O
consisted O
of O
samples O
from O
Japan. O
Notable O
under-representations O
included O
samples O
collected O
from O
Africa O
and O
Latin O
America O
(including O
the O
Caribbean). O
Data O
collected O
online O
typically O
gave O

to O
the O

Implications O
of O
Relying O
on O
WEIRD O
Samples O
In O
our O
survey, O
81% O
of O
samples O
were O
from O
WEIRD O
populations. O
The O
main O
advantages O
of O
relying O
on O
WEIRD O
samples O
arise O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
most O
authors O
are O
WEIRD, O
and O
so O
WEIRD O
samples O
are O
more O
practical O
and O
convenient, O
particularly O
in O
respect O
of O
ease O
of O
access O
and O
low O
costs O
of O
data O
sampling. O
Requiring O
costly O
and O
time-consuming O
data O
collection O
can O
stifle O
scientific O
research, O
given O
that O
it O
is O
often O
poorly O
resourced O
(Lakens O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
There O
are O
obvious O
practical O
difficulties O
in O
collecting O
data O
outside O
of O
one’s O
country O
of O
residence, O
or O
in O
countries O
where O
attitudes O
and O
familiarity O
may O
vary O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
psychological O
procedures O
that O
will O
be O
well-known O
to O
readers O
of O
this O
journal, O
such O
as O
models O
of O
obtaining O
informed O
consent, O
or O
methods O
of O
data O
elicitation. O
Indeed, O
we O
do O
not O
always O
need O
to O
go O
far O
to O
find O
diverse O
samples O
(e.g. O
Hill O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Nettle O
2017 O
; O
Wilson O
2011 O
; O
Wilson O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
WEIRD O
samples O
themselves O
are O
certainly O
not O
homogeneous, O
and O
for O
instance O
even O
people O
from O
different O
neighbourhoods O
within O
the O
same O
city O
can O
vary O
as O
much O
as O
people O
from O
entirely O
different O
cultures O
(Nettle O
2017 O
; O
Nettle O
et O
al. O
2011 O
). O
Thus, O
even O
samples O
from O
WEIRD O
cultures O
can O
be O
sufficiently O
diverse O
that O
they O
provide O
some O
useful O
evidence O
in O
support O
of O
generalisability. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
evolutionary O
psychologists O
are O
often O
keen O
to O
sample O
outside O
WEIRD O
populations O
because O
of O
their O
interest O
in O
assessing O
and O
recording O
the O
nature O
of O
humans O
as O
a O
species. O
WEIRD O
populations O
may O
experience O
environments O
(in O
terms O
of O
novel O
technology, O
experience O
of O
hunger, O
exposure O
to O
death O
and O
so O
on) O
that O
are O
particularly O
dissimilar O
from O
those O
experienced O
by O
many O
of O
our O
ancestors, O
something O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
borne O
in O
mind O
when O
constructing O
and O
testing O
evolutionary O
theories O
of O
behaviour. O

In O
these O
cases, O
macrolides O
and O
lincosamides O
are O
considered O
valid O
substitute O
drugs O
[ O
30 O
, O
31 O
], O
although O
resistance O
to O
both O
antibiotic O
classes O
is O
well O
documented O
worldwide O
[ O
32 O
– O
34 O
]. O
In O
light O
of O
all O
these O
considerations, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
efficacy O
of O
IAP O
is O
strictly O
dependent O
on O
both O
the O
timely O
detection O
of O
GBS-infected O
pregnant O
women O
and O
the O
antibiotic O
resistance O
profile O
of O
the O
isolated O
strains. O
Interestingly, O
although O
the O
choice O
of O
antibiotic O
to O
prevent O
neonatal O
transmission O
is O
based O
on O
the O
local O
epidemiology O
of O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
of O
GBS, O
in O
Italy, O
these O
data O
are O
limited O
to O
northern O
and O
central O
areas, O
whereas O
no O
recent O
information O
is O
available O
for O
the O
southern O
regions O
[ O
33 O
, O
35 O
]. O
Specifically, O
data O
concerning O
colonization O
incidence, O
serotype O
prevalence, O
and O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
profiles O
of O
GBS O
among O
pregnant O
women O
in O
Sicily O
are O
still O
largely O
unknown, O
being O
related O
to O
small O
groups O
of O
patients O
and O
short-term O
observations. O
Therefore, O
in O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
proposed O
to O
fill O
this O
gap, O
by O
evaluating O
the O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
profiling O
of O
3494 O
strains O
of O
S. O
agalactiae, O
describing O
also O
the O
prevalent O
serotypes O
in O
the O
Sicilian O
territory. O

During O

collected O
bacterial O

and O
3494 O

were O
selected O
for O
this O
study. O
A O

of O
3494 O

(37–39 O

the O
Eastern O

Sicily, O
within O
5 O
years O
comprised O
between O
January O
2015 O
and O
December O
2019. O
The O

were O
collected O
introducing O

in O
the O
middle O

of O
the O

delivered O
to O
the O

The O

were O
anonymous O

no O

was O
reported O
to O
the O

Then, O
100 O

was O
added O
to O
10 O

These O
contradictory O
results O
could O
be O
due O
to O
the O
limited O
gene O
coverage O
of O
some O
of O
the O
transposon O
libraries. O
Interestingly, O
disruption O
of O
the O
orphan O
cyp136a1 O
provided O
a O
growth O
advantage O
in O
vitro O
(DeJesus O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Even O
though O
cyp121a1 O
was O
found O
to O
be O
non-essential O
in O
these O
genome-wide O
transposon O
studies, O
cyp121a1 O
could O
only O
be O
knocked O
out O
in O
Mtb O
H37Rv O
after O
creating O
a O
merodiploid O
strain. O
This O
indicates O
that O
this O
gene O
is O
required O
for O
growth O
under O
in O
vitro O
conditions O
(McLean O
et O
al. O
2008 O
). O
Transposon O

studies O
were O
also O
conducted O
on O
bacterial O
cultures O
grown O
in O
conditions O
that O
the O
bacterium O
encounters O
during O
infection O
in O
the O
human O
host. O
These O
studies O
aimed O
to O
identify O
the O
mechanisms O
used O
by O
the O
bacterium O
to O
resist O
these O
insults. O
Griffin O
et O
al. O
identified O
cyp125a1 O
as O
the O
sole O
monooxygenase O
essential O
for O
Mtb O
H37Rv O
growth O
in O
cholesterol, O
an O
essential O
carbon O
source O
during O
Mtb O
infection. O
Furthermore, O
cyp125a1 O
was O
found O
to O
be O
essential O
during O
mouse O
infection O
(Sassetti O
and O
Rubin O
2003 O
). O
Although O
cyp125a1 O
was O
not O
found O
to O
be O
required O
for O
macrophage O
infection, O
it O
is O
part O
of O
the O
fadE28 O
locus, O
which O
is O
a O
critical O
operon O
involved O
in O
lipid O
transport, O
lipid O
degradation O
and O
assimilation O
of O
exogenous O
lipids O
from O
host O

(Cole O

1998 O
; O
McKinney O
et O

Rengarajan O

). O
Both O
FdxA O
and O
FdxC O
(the O
two O
7Fe-ferredoxins) O
were O
found O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
Mtb O
in O

(Sassetti O
et O
al. O
2003 O
; O
DeJesus O
et O

). O
For O
FdxA, O
essentiality O
was O
predicted O
using O
a O
pathway O

method O
(Xu O
et O

). O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
information O
in O
this O
mini-review O
will O
aid O
in O
assessing O
whether O
specific O
Mtb O
CYPs O
and O
redox O
partners O
are O
suitable O
candidates O
for O
the O
development O
of O
novel O
anti-TB O
drugs. O
The O
CYP O
family O
and O
cognate O
redox O
partners O
in O
Mtb O
The O
4.4 O
Mb O
genome O
of O
Mtb O
H37Rv O
contains O
twenty O
CYP O
genes O
(Cole O
et O
al. O
1998 O
). O
This O
is O
a O
relatively O
high O
number O
for O
prokaryotes, O
as O
most O
sequenced O
bacterial O
genomes O
generally O
contain O
a O
small O
number O
of O
CYP O
genes. O
The O
high O
abundance O
of O
CYP O
genes O
is O
a O
general O
characteristic O
of O
mycobacteria O
exemplified O
by O
Mycobacterium O
rhodesiae O
NBB3 O
(70), O
Mycobacterium O
avium O
104 O
(48), O
Mycobacterium O
marinum O

Mycobacterium O
smegmatis O
MC2 O
(42), O
and O
Mycobacterium O
abscessus O
47J26s/103 O
(25) O
as O
compiled O
by O
Parvez O
et O
al. O
( O
2016 O
). O
In O
contrast, O
Mycobacterium O
leprae O
has O
lost O
all O
but O
one O
functional O
CYP O
protein, O
encoded O
by O
ML2088c O
(37% O
identity O
to O
Mtb O
CYP140A1). O
However, O
this O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
overall O
reduction O
in O
genome O
size O
in O
M. O
leprae. O
Deciphering O
the O
physiological O
function O
of O
CYPs O
is O
usually O
performed O
through O
a O
combination O
of O
homology O
modeling/mapping, O
generation O
of O
single O
gene O
knockouts O
and/or O
biochemical O
characterization O
of O
the O
protein. O
Yet, O
despite O
the O
high O
abundance O
of O
CYP O
genes O
in O
mycobacteria, O
phylogenetic O
analysis O
has O
shown O
that O
Mtb O
CYPs O
exhibit O
relatively O
low O
evolutionary O
relationships O
with O
other O
species, O
with O
many O
bacterial O
species O
(like O
Escherichia O
coli) O
lacking O
CYPs O
altogether. O
CYP121A1, O
CYP128A1, O
CYP135, O
and O
CYP141A1 O
are O
predominantly O
found O
in O
mycobacteria O
belonging O
to O
the O
MTBC O

a O

In O

it O

Further, O

With O
this O

Our O

Hence, O

The O

So O
the O

the O

The O

Interestingly, O
we O
observed O
that O
the O
mRNA O
expression O
for O
cathepsin O
B, O
S O
and O
cystatin O
C O
was O
primarily O
reduced O
in O

Moreover, O
we O
observed O
profound O
down-regulation O
of O
gene O
expression O
for O
cathepsin O
B, O
S O
and O
cystatin O
B O
in O
GM-BM O

The O
level O
of O
cathepsin O

and O

protein O
was O
greatly O
reduced O
in O

cells, O
while O
cathepsin O

and O
cystatin O

expression O
was O
primarily O
reduced O
in O

These O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
our O
previous O

isolated O
from O
ECTV-infected O
susceptible O
BALB/c O

have O
decreased O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
level O
of O
cathepsins O
B, O
L O
and O
S O
[ O
24 O
]. O
We O
were O
unable O
to O
detect O
expression O
of O
cystatin O

in O
cDCs, O
however, O
according O
to O
Kopitar-Jerala O
[ O

cystatin O
A O
is O
present O
only O
in O
the O
follicular O

(FDCs) O
that O
do O
not O
internalize, O
process O
and O
present O
antigens O
in O
the O
context O
of O
MHC O

Our O
findings O
are O
in O
agreement O
with O
results O
obtained O
by O
Wang O
and O
co-authors O
[ O
25 O
], O
where O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
expression O
of O
cathepsins O
B, O
D O
and O
S O
was O
decreased O
in O
B O
cells O
during O
VACV O
infection. O
However, O
cathepsin O
L O
gene O
expression O
and O
protein O
level O
were O
enhanced O
in O
VACV-infected O
B O
cells. O
The O
authors O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O
reduced O
level O
of O
cathepsins O
may O
alter O
antigen O
processing O
and O
probably O
contributes O
to O
the O
loss O
of O
MHC O
class O
II O
function. O
Cathepsins O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
play O
essential O
roles O
in O
antigen O
processing, O
suggesting O
that O
they O
are O
involved O
in O
adaptive O
immune O
responses O
[ O
43 O
]. O
For O
example, O
studies O
focused O
on O
cathepsin O
S O
revealed O
that O
this O
acid-independent O
lysosomal O
cysteine O
protease O
mediates O
processing O
of O

in O
macrophage-like O

[ O

Previous O
work O
in O
our O
lab O
has O
shown O
that O
PLG O
−/− O
mice O
have O
a O
decreased O
neuroimmune O
response O
following O
hippocampal O
injection O
of O
LPS O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
however, O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
distinguish O
between O
the O
roles O
of O
brain- O
and O
liver-derived O
PLG O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
this O
response. O
We O
extended O
this O
study O
by O
using O
an O
ASO O
that O
specifically O
targets O
liver-produced O
PLG O
and O
found O
that O
it O
is O
plasma O
PLG O
that O
is O
crucial O
to O
regulating O
this O
response. O
Furthermore, O
we O
found O
that O
systemic O
challenge O
with O
LPS O
is O
sufficient O
to O
drive O
a O
neuroinflammatory O
response, O
and O
direct O
injection O
into O
the O
brain O
is O
not O
required. O
This O
situation O
better O
recapitulates O
what O
happens O
physiologically O
in O
the O
body O
in O
response O
to O
pathogens. O
PLG O
receptors O
are O
distributed O
broadly O
on O
many O
types O
of O
cells, O
including O
monocytes, O
macrophages, O
endothelial O
cells, O
and O
platelets O
[ O
16 O
]. O
The O
proteolytic O
functions O
of O
PLG O
allow O
it O
to O
degrade O
extracellular O
matrices O
and O
activate O
growth O
factors O
that O
aid O
in O
cell O
migration. O
Studies O
with O
PLG O
−/− O
mice O
have O
shown O
that O
monocytes O
and O
macrophages O
have O
an O
impaired O
ability O
to O
migrate O
to O
the O
peritoneum O
when O
thioglycollate, O
an O
inducer O
of O
neutrophils, O
granulocytes, O
monocytes, O
and O
lymphocytes, O
is O
injected O
[ O

]. O
Furthermore, O
mice O
with O
increased O
plasmin O
activity O
due O
to O
knockout O
of O
alpha-2-antiplasmin, O
a O
plasmin O
inhibitor, O
have O
increased O
macrophage O
recruitment O
in O
the O
thioglycollate O
injection O
model O
[ O

]. O
Moreover, O
macrophage O
recruitment O
is O
suppressed O
when O
mice O
are O
given O
tranexamic O
acid, O
a O
lysine O
analog O
that O
inhibits O
PLG, O
in O
their O
drinking O
water O
[ O

]. O
These O
various O
studies O
linking O
PLG O
to O

cell O
migration O
led O
to O
a O
proteomics-based O
search O
for O

Introduction O
Mycoses O
are O
neglected, O
under-diagnosed, O
and O
sub-estimated O
diseases, O
that O
represent O
an O
important O
public O
health O
problem, O
yet O
they O
are O
not O
compulsorily O
notifiable O
diseases O
in O
Brazil. O
Since O
pathogenic O
fungi O
causing O
systemic O
mycoses O
are O
found O
in O
the O
environment, O
we O
hypothesised O
that O
outbreaks O
would O
be O
affected O
by O
geoclimatic O
factors O
such O
as O
wind, O
precipitation, O
air O
temperature, O
and O
absolute O
and O
relative O
air O
humidity. O
In O
addition O
to O
climatic O
variables, O
the O
proliferation O
of O
urban O
pigeons O
and O
bats, O
drought, O
agricultural O
activity, O
and O
the O
practice O
of O
hunting O
armadillos O
represent O
sources O
that O
contribute O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
fungal O
infections O
and O
contribute O
to O
the O
persistence O
of O
pathogenic O
fungi O
in O
the O
environment O
1 O
– O
3 O
. O
The O
seasonal O
timing O
of O
outbreaks O
of O
fungal O
disease O
can O
be O
linked O
to O
periods O
of O
greater O
dispersion O
by O
wind O
anomalies O
and O
the O
effect O
of O
climate O
change O
on O
precipitation O
and O
temperature O
4 O
. O
Precipitation O
and O
temperature O
are O
crucial O
climatic O
variables O
for O
understanding O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
physical O
environment O
5 O
. O
Understanding O
the O
seasonal O
behavior O
of O
these O
variables O
is O
fundamental O
for O
understanding O
the O
impact O
fungal O
pathogens O
on O
human O
health. O
However, O
there O
are O
few O
studies O
focusing O
on O
correlation O
between O
environmental O
variables O
and O
hospitalization O
due O
to O
invasive O
fungal O
infections. O
In O
addition, O
most O
of O
them O
describe O
only O
the O
global O
impact O
of O
climate O
change, O
but O
lack O
an O
evaluation O
of O
temporal O
patterns O
at O
different O
scales O
1 O
– O
3 O
, O
6 O
, O
7 O
. O
In O
this O
context, O
epidemiology O
is O
considered O
an O
importance O
science O
which O
encourages O
research O
about O
public O
health O
issues. O
The O
influence O
of O
climate O
on O
infectious O
diseases O
as O
Ebola, O
Dengue, O
Chikungunya, O
and O
the O
West O
Nile O
fever O
is O
already O
well O
known O
8 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
there O
is O
very O
little O
awareness O
of O
this O
phenomenon O
regarding O
mycoses. O
The O
goal O
of O
this O
work O
was O
to O
evaluate O
the O
statistical O
correlations O
in O
time O
series O
(2008−2016) O
of O
climate O
and O
hospitalizations O
for O
mycoses O
(HM) O
in O
the O
state O
capitals O
of O
Brazil. O

In O
a O
trial O
of O
Jensen O
et O
al. O
( O
2005 O
) O
the O
mating O
distance O
(flight O
radius O
of O
queens O
+ O
flight O
radius O
of O
drones) O
was O
in O
50% O
less O
than O
2.5 O
km, O
and O
for O
90% O
within O
7.5 O
km. O
The O
higher O
latter O
distance O
can O
probably O
be O
explained O
by O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
flight O
range O
of O
queens, O
presumably O
caused O
by O
a O
lack O
of O
drones O
in O
the O
area O
(as O
reflected O
by O
a O
reduced O
number O
of O
matings O
per O
queen, O
Neumann O
et O
al. O
1999a O
, O
b O
). O
The O
DBBB O
selection O
scheme O
that O
we O
propose O
is O
based O
on O
negative O
selection O
(non-survival O
of O
non-adapted O
phenotypes) O
and O
does O
not O
aim O
for O
strong O
increases O
of O
specific O
(chosen) O
traits/phenotypes. O
Therefore, O
if O
a O
few O
foreign O
alleles O
enter O
the O
genepool O
this O
will O
probably O
not O
interfere O
with O
the O
natural O
selection O
process. O
Moreover, O
the O
DBBB O
procedure O
(see O
below) O
produces O
an O
excess O
of O
mature O
local O
own O
drones O
at O
the O
right O
mating O
time, O
which O
will O
most O
likely O
outcompete O
far O
flying O
foreigners O
by O
far. O
No O
Varroa O
destructor O
control O
No O
V. O
destructor O
control O
is O
applied O
to O
the O
DBBB O
selection O
colonies O
throughout O
the O
duration O
of O
the O
program, O
apart O
from O
the O
one O
oxalic O
acid O
treatment O
in O
the O
first O
summer. O
Conversely, O
V. O
destructor O
is O
controlled O
in O
the O
control O
group O
in O
order O
to O
keep O
the O
population O
of O
mites O
at O
an O
acceptable O
level O
to O
avoid O
damage O
and O
to O
avoid O
selection O
pressure O
by O
V. O
destructor O
infestation O
taking O
place O
in O
control O
colonies O
too. O
In O
our O
case, O
the O
use O
of O
oxalic O
acid O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
capped O
brood O
twice O
a O
year O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
sufficient O
control O
treatment O
(Panziera O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Feeding O
of O
the O
colonies O
Feeding O
colonies O
is O
obviously O
not O
natural. O
We O
know O
from O
the O
work O
of O
Seeley O
( O
1995 O
, O
2017 O
) O
that O
in O
the O
wild O
(here O
Arnot O
Forest), O
only O
23% O
of O
founder O
colonies O
from O
primary O
swarms O
that O
successfully O
occupy O
a O
nest O
cavity O
are O
able O
to O
survive O
the O
first O
winter. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
established O
colonies, O
the O
winter O
survival O
rate O
increases O
to O
84% O
(Seeley O
2017 O
). O
Starvation O
over O
winter O
may O
be O
the O
prime O
cause O
for O
not O
surviving O
of O
colonies O
in O
the O
wild. O

One O
classification O
of O
the O
groEL O
gene O
has O
identified O
the O
circulation O
of O
four O
ecotypes O
among O
vertebrates O
of O
Europe O
[ O
15 O
]. O
We O
define O
in O
this O
paper O
an O
ecotype O
as O
a O
cluster O
of O
genetically O
similar O
A. B-PATH
phagocytophilum I-PATH
isolates O
based O
on O
groEL O
sequences O
following O
Jahfari O
et O
al. O
[ O
15 O
]. O
Ecotype B-PATH
I I-PATH
based O
on O
this O
classification O
is O
linked O
to O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
mammals O
including O
red O
deer O
(Cervus O
elaphus), O
livestock O
and O
humans, O
whereas O
ecotype O
II O
is O
linked O
mainly O
to O
roe O
deer O
(Capreolus O
capreolus). O
Both O
ecotypes O
are O
most O
probably O
vectored O
by O
I. O
ricinus. O
Ecotype O
III O
is O
associated O
with O
small O
mammals O
and O
expected O
to O
be O
vectored O
by O
Ixodes O
trianguliceps O
[ O
16 O
], O
while O
ecotype O
IV O
is O
linked O
to O
birds O
and O
potentially O
vectored O
by O
I. O
frontalis O
[ O
15 O
]. O
In O
support O
of O
this O
scheme, O
the O
ecotype O
II O
found O
in O
roe O
deer O
was O
for O
example O
not O
the O
one O
found O
in O
livestock O
in O
France O
[ O
17 O
]. O
However, O
due O
to O
scarcity O
of O
studies, O
this O
classification O
in O
ecotypes O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
working O
hypothesis O
of O
circulation O
and O
transmission, O
rather O
than O
as O
a O
definitive O
answer. O
Ixodes O
ricinus O
ticks O
are O
now O
expanding O
their O
distribution O
range O
towards O
northern O
latitudes O
[ O
2 O
, O
18 O
]. O
This O
also O
involves O
a O
shift O
into O
the O
distribution O
range O
of O
another O
community O
of O
mammals O
compared O
to O
continental O
Europe. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
potential O
cervid O
transmission O
hosts O
are O
no O
longer O
limited O
to O
roe O
deer O
and O
red O
deer, O
but O
also O
include O
moose O
(Alces O
alces). O
Moose O
is O
by O
far O
the O
most O
important O
game O
species O
in O
terms O
of O
meat O
and O
economy O
both O
in O
Sweden O

Moose O
is O
widespread O
in O

it O
is O
important O
to O

its O
role O
in O
the O

Introduction O
Coronavirus O
disease O
2019 O
(COVID-19) O
is O
caused O
by O
severe O
acute O
respiratory O
syndrome O
coronavirus O
2 O
(SARS-CoV-2). O
Medical O
symptoms O
vary O
from O
asymptomatic O
inflammation O
to O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
systemic O
and/or O
respiratory O
manifestations O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Laboratory O
findings O
among O
hospitalized O
COVID-19 O
patients O
include O
lymphopenia, O
high O
levels O
of O
aminotransaminase O
and O
elevated O
inflammatory O
markers O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
SARS-CoV-2 O
diagnostic O
test O
is O
the O
real-time O
reverse O
transcriptase-polymerase O
reaction O
chain O
test O
(RT-PCR), O
which O
is O
very O
specific O
but O
has O
low O
sensitivity O
(54–73%) O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Regarding O
imaging, O
computed O
tomography O
(CT) O
presents O
a O
sensitivity O
up O
to O
95%, O
vastly O
outperforming O
RT-PCR O
[ O
4 O
]. O
However, O
the O
Multinational O
Consensus O
Statement O
from O
the O
Fleischner O
Society O
stated O
that O
CT O
scan O
should O
not O
be O
used O
for O
screening O
or O
as O
a O
first-line O
test O
for O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
COVID-19 O
[ O
5 O
], O
also O
because O
the O
use O
of O
a O
non-dedicated O
scanner O
CT O
requires O
time-consuming O
and O
laborious O
decontamination O
procedures O
to O
limit O
the O
risk O
of O
cross O
infection O
[ O
6 O
]. O
In O
this O
light, O
chest O
X-rays O
(CXR) O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
an O
alternative O
to O
CT, O
also O
for O
the O
easy O
and O
fast O
cleaning O
of O
the O
equipment O
and O
the O
large O
availability O
of O
portable O
units. O
In O
Northern O
Italy, O
the O
epicenter O
of O
the O
Italian O
SARS-CoV-2 O
pandemic, O
some O
emergency O
departments O
use O
CXR O
as O
the O
first O
line O
of O
triage O
in O
patients O
with O
suspected O
COVID-19 O
also O
because O
of O
the O
relatively O
long O
waiting O
time O
for O
RT-PCR. O
Although, O
the O
common O
opinion O
is O
that O
CXR O
may O
not O
be O
sufficiently O
sensitive O
for O
the O
detection O
of O
COVID-19 O
lung O
disease O
especially O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
pathology, O
there O
are O
only O
a O
few O
studies O
in O
the O
literature O
assessing O
its O
sensitivity O
in O
respect O
to O
the O
current O
diagnostic O
gold O
standard, O
RT-PCR O
[ O
7 O
– O
12 O
]. O

Inflammation O
was O
first O
implicated O
in O
AD O
pathology O
and O
development O
in O
the O
1990s, O
with O
the O
neuropathological O
finding O
of O
activated O
inflammatory O

(microglia O

and O
inflammatory O
proteins O
(e.g. O

surrounding O
the O

and O
the O
neurofibrillary O
tangles O
(Aisen O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
epidemiological O

and O
other O
patient O
groups O
with O
a O
high O

Many O
of O

the O

of O
the O

i.e. O
an O

that O
does O
not O

or O

However, O

can O
now O

in O

to O
the O

Identifying O

(Akiyama O

Since O
the O

or O

after O
Kutsi, O
who O
was O
the O
grandmother O
creator O
and O
first O
woman O
in O
Wixarika O
mythology, O
who O
germinated O
all O
plants O
and O
living O
creatures O
of O
the O
world O
(Perrin O
1994 O
; O
Neurath O
2002 O
; O
Iturrioz-Leza O
2004 O
). O
These O
concepts O
lack O
a O
literal O
translation, O
thus O
the O
Wixaritari O
have O
referred O
to O
these O
mushrooms O
in O
Spanish O
as O
hongos O
de O
Dios O
(mushrooms O
from O
God). O
Some O
mushroom O
names O
used O
by O
mestizos O
were O
introduced O
by O
the O
Wixaritari. O
Cantharellus O
cibarius O
was O
called O
flores O
(flowers), O
which O
is O
the O
literal O
translation O
of O
the O
Wixarika O
name, O
tuutuxi. O
This O
name O
and O
the O
use O
of O
this O
mushroom O
spread O
from O
the O
Wixaritari O
to O
the O
mestizos O
during O
the O
government O
campaign O
to O
eradicate O
malaria O
in O
the O
1960s O
(Cervantes-González O
1978 O
), O
during O
which O
trained O
mestizos O
worked O
for O
many O
years O
in O
Wixarika O
communities. O
When O
selling O
Amanita O
basii O
or O
A. O
laurae, O
the O
Wixaritari O
translated O
the O
name O
yekwá O
to O
hongo O
real O
(true O
mushroom) O
in O
Spanish. O
In O
this O
case, O
real O
refers O
to O
“reality” O
because O
it O
is O
an O
edible O
mushroom O
within O
the O
tangible O
realm O
of O
the O
cosmos. O
In O
contrast, O
A. O
muscaria O
or O
yekwá O
kutsiyari O
forms O
part O
of O
the O
spiritual O
realm O
and O
should O
not O
be O
eaten. O
Ecology O
In O
the O
municipality, O
mushrooms O
were O
associated O
with O
the O
maintenance O
of O
life O
and O
natural O
cycles. O
Individuals O
also O
mentioned O
the O
capacity O
of O
mushrooms O
to O
degrade O
organic O
matter O
and O
recognized O
that O
conditions O
of O
humidity O
and O
shade O
were O
necessary O
for O
mushrooms O
to O
be O
produced, O
similar O
to O
the O
knowledge O
of O
other O
communities O
in O
central O
Mexico O
and O
Colombia O
(Vasco-Palacios O
et O
al. O
2008 O
; O
Jasso-Arriaga O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Mushrooms O
were O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
source O
of O
food O
for O
humans O
and O
animals, O
although O
some O
individuals O
warned O
that O
animals O
eat O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
mushrooms O
that O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
edible O
for O
humans. O
Additionally, O
both O
groups O
understand O
that O
distinct O
mushrooms O
species O
are O
found O
in O
different O
habitats. O

Nevertheless, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
attribute O
the O
substantial O
decreases O
in O
clearance O
of O
four O
different O
drugs O
to O
the O
observed O
down-regulation O
of O
most O
P450 O
mRNAs O
and O
proteins O
studied, O
although O
changes O
to O
hepatic O
blood O
flow O
and O
plasma O
protein O
binding O
could O
also O
contribute O
to O
the O
altered O
drug O
clearance O
in O
this O
Plasmodium O
infection O
model. O
In O
humans O
with O
uncomplicated O
malaria, O
there O
was O
a O
small O
increase O
in O
plasma O
protein O
binding O
of O
quinine O
in O
the O
plasma O
in O
one O
study O
[ O
61 O
], O
whereas O
another O
found O
no O
effect O
[ O
6 O
]. O
In O
the O
latter O
study, O
liver O
blood O
flow O
measured O
with O
iodocyanine O
green O
was O
reported O
to O
be O
reduced O
by O
40% O
compared O
to O
convalescing O
individuals. O
If O
such O
changes O
in O
blood O
flow O
also O
occur O
in O
mice, O
the O
relative O
contribution O
of O
reduced O
liver O
blood O
flow O
to O
the O
changes O
in O
clearance O
would O
be O
expected O
to O
be O
greatest O
for O
high-clearance O
substrates, O
such O
as O
bupropion. O
This O
study O
used O
Orbitrap-based O
high-resolution O
mass O
metabolomics O
MS O
platform O
to O
perform O
determination O
of O
clearance O
for O
multiple O
substrates O
after O
cassette O
dosing. O
Among O
the O
advantages O
of O
this O
approach O
are O
that O
full-scan O
HRMS O
data O
allows O
for O
the O
metabolomic O
signatures O
of O
the O
experimental O
condition O
(in O
this O
case, O
malaria) O
to O
be O
yielded O
in O
the O
same O
sample O
run, O
and O
analysed O
later. O
It O
may O
be O
possible O
from O
such O
data O
to O
correlate O
levels O
of O
endogenous O
P450 O
substrates O
and O
other O
biomarkers O
with O
the O
measured O
drug O
pharmacokinetics, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
this O
approach O
could O
not O
also O
be O
taken O
in O
human O
subjects. O
Four O
of O
the O
five O
drugs O
studied O
provided O
reliable O
data, O
with O
measurable O
pharmacokinetic O
parameters O
that O
demonstrated O
clear O
differences O
between O
naïve O
and O
infected O
mice. O
The O
atypical O
plasma O
profile O
of O
bufuralol O
may O
be O
the O
result O
of O
an O
analytical O
artifact O
caused O
by O
the O
co-elution O
of O
an O
in-source O
fragment O
from O
a O
bufuralol O
metabolite, O
likely O
hydroxybufuralol. O
This O
is O
the O
likeliest O
explanation O
for O
high O
background O
observed O
for O
bufuralol O
M+H O
in O
all O
samples O

that O
received O

However, O
since O
many O
studies O
are O
indicating O
I. O
ricinus O
as O
the O
vector O
and O
cervids O
as O
potential O
hosts O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
DNA-based O
detection O
provides O
useful O
information O
when O
aiming O
to O
elucidate O
the O
different O
enzootic O
cycles. O
There O
are, O
however, O
several O
other O
difficult O
issues O
in O
determining O
circulation O
and O
enzootic O
cycles O
of O
pathogens. O
Adaptations O
of O
bacteria O
to O
specific O
host O
groups O
require O
mutations O
in O
coding O
genes, O
but O
many O
mutations O
are O
neutral O
and O
single O
mutation O
sequence O
dissimilarity O
is O
not O
sufficient O
in O
the O
meaning O
of O
ecotype O
characterization O
or O
bacterial O
speciation O
[ O
38 O
]. O
That O
we O
found O
both O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
in O
moose, O
can O
be O
seen O
as O
evidence O
that O
ecotype O
are O
not O
entirely O
host-specific O
and O
have O
overlapping O
niches. O
The O
distinction O
between O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
are O
less O
marked O
than O
the O
distinction O
between O
ecotype O
I/II O
and O
the O
other O
two O
ecotypes, O
involving O
many O
different O
ruminant O
hosts. O
The O
ankA O
gene O
identifies O
some O
of O
the O
same O
correlation O
to O
host O
species O
as O
groEL O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Both O
methods O
group O
sequences O
so O
that O
roe O
deer O
is O
probably O
not O
the O
major O
reservoir O
of O
granulocytic O
anaplasmosis O
in O
humans O
and O
domestic O
animals, O
and O
that O
red O
deer O
could O
be O
the O
reservoir O
for O
that O
ecotype. O
A O
limitation O
of O
our O
methodology O
is O
that O
co-infection O
of O
ecotypes O
would O
not O
be O
discovered. O
The O
high O
infection O
prevalence O
of O
both O
ecotypes O
in O
moose O
makes O
it O
likely O
that O
mixed O
infections O
can O
be O
common. O
This O
could O
be O
addressed O
with O
other O
methods O
such O
as O
Reverse O
Line O
Blot O
in O
future O
work. O
Obtaining O
sequence O
data O
from O
positive O
samples O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
required O
for O
determination O
of O
ecotype O
can O
be O
challenging. O
We O
had O
a O
fairly O
low O
success O
(42–57%) O
in O
obtaining O
sequence O
data, O
and O
the O
sequencing O
success O
was O
good O
when O
Ct O
values O
(i.e. O
the O
number O
of O
PCR O
cycles O
before O
getting O
a O
positive O
signal) O
were O
below O
30. O
This O
highlights O
the O
need O
for O
large O
sample O
sizes. O
There O
are O
only O
two O
previous O
groEL O
sequences O
reported O
from O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
isolated O
from O
moose O
tissue. O

In O
addition, O
when O
switching O
to O
the O
oral O
route O
in O
the O
POET O
trial, O
all O
oral O
regimens O
included O
two O
antibiotics O
from O
different O
drug O
classes O
and O
with O
different O
antibacterial O
effects O
and O
different O
metabolization O
processes. O
This O
was O
to O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
pharmacokinetic O
variations O
of O
the O
orally O
administered O
antibiotics O
[ O
43 O
]. O
We O
have O
differed O
in O
offering O
only O
metronidazole O
as O
monotherapy, O
for O
the O
reasons O
outlined O
above O
and O
with O
a O
good O
degree O
of O
confidence O
that O
it O
would O
provide O
suitable O
cover. O
The O
POET O
trial O
has O
demonstrated O
that O
oral O
therapy O
with O
two O
agents O
was O
sufficient O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
aerobic O
endocarditis O
in O
selected O
cases O
[ O
4 O
]. O
We O
have O
added O
to O
this O
evidence O
a O
case O
in O
which O
an O
anaerobic O
endocarditis O
was O
found O
to O
be O
treatable O
with O
oral O
monotherapy O
alone. O
In O
a O
time O
of O
renewed O
focus O
on O
antibiotic O
stewardship O
and O
avoidance O
of O
unnecessary O
use O
of O
antimicrobials, O
this O
is O
an O
exciting O
development. O
Our O
patient O
received O
a O
total O
of O
62 O
days O
of O
oral O
metronidazole, O
with O
only O
6 O
days O
of O
IV O
metronidazole O
given O
during O
the O
immediate O
post-operative O
period O
in O
the O
intensive O
care O
setting, O
compared O
to O
only O
19 O
days O
of O
IV O
vancomycin. O
Follow-up O
demonstrated O
clinical O
and O
biochemical O
evidence O
of O
cure. O
This O
suggests O
that O
the O
use O
of O
single O
agent O
oral O
antibiotic O
regimens O
may O
be O
a O
possible O
development O
in O
the O
future O
of O
infective O
endocarditis O
treatment. O
However, O
further O
research O
is O
required O
to O
determine O
the O
safety O
and O
efficacy O
of O
oral O
antibiotic O
monotherapy O
in O
the O
future. O
Conclusion O
We O
have O
discussed O
an O
unusual O
case O
of O
F. B-PATH
magna I-PATH
endocarditis O
affecting O
a O
bioprosthetic O
heart O
valve. O
Because O
of O
the O
tendency O
toward O
negative O
blood O
cultures O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
diagnosis, O
a O
high O
index O
of O
suspicion O
is O
needed O
to O
diagnose O
endocarditis O
in O
vulnerable O
patients O
with O
non-specific O
features. O
This O
case O
also O
demonstrates O
successful O
treatment O
of O
an O
anaerobic O
endocarditis O
with O
outpatient O
oral O
antibiotic O
therapy. O
This O
builds O
on O
previous O
work O
which O
has O
shown O
outpatient O
oral O
antibiotics O
to O
be O
a O
feasible O
treatment O
for O
selected O
cases. O

Previous O
studies O
have O
identified O
host-range O
determinants O
such O
as O
gp17 O
in O
T7 O
phage O
and O
gp37 O
and O
gp3 O
in O
T4-like O
phages O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
], O
but O
none O
of O
the O
currently O
known O
host O
range O
determinants O
showed O
similarity O
to O
the O
ORFs O
of O
φAbp2, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
unannotated O
ORFs O
might O
hold O
the O
key O
to O
the O
specific O
host O
range O
characteristics O
of O
φAbp2. O
The O
putative O
foreign O
genes O
of O
φAbp2 O
(ORF46, O
48, O
80, O
and O
87) O
showed O
a O
degree O
of O
similarity O
to O
genes O
of O
non-microbial O
organisms O
suggesting O
that O
this O
phage O
can O
carry O
foreign O
genes O
and O
possibly O
even O
human O
genes. O
It O
is O
proposed O
that O
φAbp2 O
may O
interact O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
with O
these O
organisms, O
since O
phages O
might O
acquire O
foreign O
genes O
to O
allow O
them O
to O
produce O
soluble O
factors O
[ O
23 O
]. O
To O
determine O
whether O
phage O
φAbp2 O
might O
be O
temperate, O
we O
searched O
for O
lysogenic O
phage O
genes, O
but O
found O
only O
one O
possible O
lysogenic O
gene O
(ORF30). O
Although O
no O
known O
lysogenic O
factors, O
including O
excisionase O
or O
anti-repressor O
proteins O
[ O
24 O
], O
were O
found O
during O
the O
genome O
annotation O
of O
φAbp2, O
the O
predicted O
proteins O
with O
unknown O
functions O
might O
nevertheless O
have O
lysogen-related O
functions. O
The O
presence O
of O
ORFs O
(ORF46 O
and O
80) O
with O
similarity O
to O
two O
genes O
of O
Homo O
sapiens O
suggests O
that O
these O
genes O
might O
have O
been O
acquired O
from O
humans. O
The O
application O
of O
φAbp2 O
to O
humans O
might O
lead O
to O
complications, O
including O
immune O
effects, O
as O
phages O
have O
been O
shown O
recently O
to O
interact O
directly O
with O
somatic O
cells O
[ O
25 O
– O
27 O
]. O
The O
presence O
of O
foreign O
gene O
fragments O
reminds O
us O
that O
the O
clinical O
use O
of O
phages O
will O
require O
caution, O
and O
it O
might O
be O
more O
suitable O
to O
use O
“clean, O
simple” O
engineered O
phages O
in O
clinical O
practice. O
Conclusion O
We O
isolated O
and O
sequenced O
the O
genome O
of O
phage O
φAbp2, O
which O
has O
a O
broad O
host O
lysis O
spectrum O
in O
native O
strains O
and O
broad O
tolerance, O
which O
improves O
its O
prospects O
for O
clinical O
application. O
Its O
host O
spectrum O
requires O
further O
research O
at O
the O
genetic O
level. O

. O
As O

the O

much O
higher O
in O

In O

The O

the O

Furthermore, O

This O
retrospective O
study O
was O
conducted O
at O
a O

All O
patients O
presenting O
K. B-PATH

infections O
from O
January O
2019 O
to O
December O
2019 O
were O
included O
in O
the O

K. O

were O
consecutively O
collected O
from O
these O

Interestingly, O
in O
the O
only O
sequenced O
Glomeromycotina O
species, O
Rhizophagus O

there O
are O
no O
fewer O
than O
three O
CLO/PXG–like O

(Additional O

As O
noted O
above, O
entomopathogenic O
fungi O
use O
specialized O
structures, O
termed O
appressoria, O
to O
break O
through O
the O
cuticular O
surfaces O
of O
their O
hosts O
and O
similar O
structures O
are O
found O
in O
phytopathogenic O
fungi. O
It O
is O
known O
that O
lipid O
droplets O
are O
required O
for O
appressorium O
function O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
the O
high O
turgor O
pressure O
that O
is O
required O
for O
virulence O
[ O

]. O
In O
both O
the O
rice O
blast O
fungus, O
Magnaporthe O
grisea O
[ O

], O
and O
the O
insect O
pathogen, O
Metarhizium O
anisopliae O
[ O

], O
lipid O
droplets O
originate O
in O
fungal O
spores O
and O
redistribute O
to O
the O
incipient O
appressorium. O
Lipid O
droplets O
also O
play O
roles O
in O
colonization O
and O
sexual O
development O
in O
other O
fungi O
including O
the O
wheat O
pathogen, O
Fusarium O
graminearum O
[ O
112 O
], O
and O
Aspergillus B-PATH
nidulans I-PATH
[ O
113 O
], O
which O
is O
both O
a O
soil-dwelling O
fungus O
and O
opportunistic O
human O
pathogen. O
Interestingly, O
in O
the O
widely O
studied O
Saccharomycetes O
class, O
only O
one O
out O
of O
the O
48 O
sequenced O
species O
contains O
CLO/PXG O
genes. O
Therefore, O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
are O
absent O
from O
such O
important O
experimental O
species O
as O
brewers’ O
yeast, O
Candida O
spp. O
and O
Pichia O
spp. O
but O
are O
present O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
yeast, O
Lipomyces O
starkeyi O
(Additional O

However, O
when O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
from O
either O
fungi O
or O
plants O
are O
expressed O
in O
the O
normally O
CLO/PXG O
genes-deficient O
yeast, O
Saccharomyces O
cerevisiae, O
the O
genes O
are O
expressed O
and O
active O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
are O
produced, O
leading O
to O
increased O
accumulation O
of O
intracellular O
lipid O
droplets O
that O
harbour O
these O
proteins O

able O
to O
catalyze O

CYP125A1 O

The O
gene O

were O
confirmed O
by O
Southern O

( O

Because O
the O
two O

only O
one O

selected O
for O

respectively. O
In O
addition, O
over O
10 O

were O
generated O
for O
each O

and O
were O
able O
to O

the O

were O
named O
etfa O

respectively. O
Because O
of O
the O
roles O
of O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
in O
fatty O
acid O
β O

and O
nutrition O
metabolism, O
we O
assessed O
the O

of O
the O

by O
growing O
on O
two O
different O
nutrition O

On O
the O

the O

ETF O

ETFDH O
mutants O
(etfa O

comparison O
to O
the O
grey O

( O

In O
addition, O
the O

was O
reduced O
(from O

after O
a O
10-day O

These O
results O
were O
similar O
to O
those O
of O

However, O
when O
cultured O

only O
displayed O
a O

4–6 O
weeks O
(Sandhu O

Persistent O

mainly O
in O
persons O
suffering O
from O

Cryptosporidiosis O

in O
solid O

patients O
(Kaniyarakkal O

Cryptosporidiosis O
is O
also O
a O

infection O
that O
can O
disseminate O
to O
biliary O

(Lantermier O

(Shrivastava O

In O

Forty-six-year-old O

admitted O
to O
the O

because O
of O
persistent O
low-grade O
fever, O
lymphadenopathy, O
joint O

and O
watery O
diarrhea O
lasting O
for O
5 O
weeks. O
Prior O
to O
the O
admission, O
he O
was O
hospitalized O
in O
the O
Internal O
Ward, O
but O
no O
tentative O
diagnosis O
was O
established, O
except O
chronic O
tonsillitis O
(he O
was O

Previously, O
he O

also O
suffered O
from O
skin O
Streptococcus B-PATH

mixed O
infection. O
No O
history O
of O
previous O

On O
admission O
to O
the O
Clinic, O
he O
was O
afebrile. O
Physical O
examination O
revealed O
presence O
of O
cervical O
and O
axillar O
lymphadenopathy O
and O
increased O
bowel O

Blood O

confirmed O
an O

Because O
of O
diarrhea, O
stool O

was O
performed. O

The O
peritoneal O

(TGF)-β O
was O
also O
significantly O
elevated O
at O
14 O
and O
21 O
days O
after O
MGO O
treatment. O
To O
further O
investigate O
the O
peritoneal O
fibrotic O
process, O
we O
assessed O
fibrotic O
changes O
in O
the O
visceral O
peritoneum O
and O
found O
that O
MGO O
induced O
shrinkage O
of O
the O
mesentery, O
and O
its O
area O
was O
apparently O
decreased O
after O
MGO O
treatment O
in O
a O
time-dependent O
manner O
(Fig. O

Furthermore, O
some O
mice O
exhibited O
bowel O
adhesions, O
a O
clinical O
presentation O
similar O
to O
EPS, O
at O
21 O
days O
after O
MGO O

Consistently, O
the O

However, O
there O
are O
reports O
of O
an O
airSR O
mutation O
in O
several O
strains O
including O
Newman O
[ O
22 O
], O
MW2 O
[ O
29 O
], O
a O
clinically O
isolated O
strain O
15981 O
[ O
9 O
], O
and O
NCTC8325, O
indicating O
that O
AirSR O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
essential O
in O
all O
strain O
backgrounds. O
Early O
research O
on O
airSR O
reported O
that O
this O
TCS O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
nitrate O
respiratory O
pathway O
[ O
21 O
] O
or O
in O
the O
direct O
regulation O
of O
the O
lac O
and O
opuCABCD O
operons O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Our O
microarray O
results O
indicated O
the O
down-regulation O
of O
the O
nar O
and O
nre O
operons O
in O
the O
airSR O
mutant, O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
report O
that O
airSR O
can O
positively O
regulate O
the O
nitrate O
respiratory O
pathway O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Our O
microarray O
data, O
however, O
did O
not O
show O
that O
airSR O
can O
regulate O
lac O
or O
opuC O
operons O
(data O
not O
shown). O
Another O
group O
that O
first O
named O
this O
TCS O
airSR O
described O
airSR O
as O
an O
oxygen O
sensing O
and O
redox-signaling O
regulator. O
Though O
they O
stated O
that O
airS O
contains O
a O
Fe-S-cluster O
essential O
for O
oxygen O
sensing O
and O
is O
only O
active O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
oxygen O
in O
vitro, O
they O
found O
that O
the O
airR O
mutant O
only O
affects O
gene O
expression O
under O
anaerobic O
conditions O
in O
strain O
Newman O
[ O
22 O
]. O
In O
contrast, O
our O
results O
showed O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
cell O
wall O
metabolism-related O
genes O
was O
not O
changed O
under O
anaerobic O
conditions O
(Figure O
3 O
d), O
but O
only O
under O
aerobic O
conditions O
(Figure O
3 O
a,b,c). O
After O
further O
comparison O
of O
their O
microarray O
data O
with O
ours, O
we O
found O
that, O
cap O
operon, O
pbp1, O
and O
lytM O
were O
under O
negative O
control O
of O
AirR O
in O
their O
strain O
but O
positive O
control O
in O
our O
strain; O
saeSR, O
agr, O
and O
RNAIII O
were O
under O
negative O
control O
in O
their O
strain O
but O
not O
changed O
in O
our O
strain; O
spa O
and O
hlgC O
are O
under O
positive O
control O
of O
AirR O
in O
both O
strains O
(see O
Additional O
file O
4 O
). O
The O
discrepancy O
may O
suggest O
that O
the O
regulatory O
activity O
of O
AirR O
is O
strain O
specific. O
Why O
AirSR O
acts O
differently O
in O
different O
strains O
is O
still O
not O
clear. O

Likewise, O
in O

there O
is O
an O

when O
cells O
were O
treated O
with O
both O
IFN-α O
or O

or O
their O

(Figure O

When O

added O
after O

and O
remained O
until O

or O
it O

the O

high O

that O
masked O
its O

(Figure O

For O

On O

Several O

reported O
that O
down-regulation O

For O

cathepsin O

by O
cystatin O
C O
or O
CA-074Me O
(synthetic O

[ O

Harman O

[ O

have O
demonstrated O
that O
mRNA O

protein O
expression O

cathepsin O
B, O
C, O
S, O

were O
profoundly O
decreased O
in O
human O
monocyte-derived O

Moreover, O
cathepsin O
L O
protein O
level O
was O
increased O
in O
cells O
infected O
with O
HIV-1. O
These O
studies O
suggest O
that O
the O
reduction O

possibly O
impairs O
late O
endosomal O
degradation O
of O
HIV-1, O
resulting O
in O
uncontrolled O
replication O

virus O
in O

Moreover, O
authors O
hypothesized O
that O
reduced O
function O

cathepsins O
may O
lead O
to O
decrease O

We O

with O

that O
have O
been O
already O

(i.e., O

These O
data O
appear O
to O
contradict O
Anderson O
(1985) O
who O
noted O
that O
only O
a O
small O
number O
of O
the O
species O
collected O
in O
the O
remote O
Hmong O
mountain O
villages O
in O

are O
cited O
elsewhere O
but O
may O
be O
explained O
by O
Anderson’s O
prior O
publication O
of O
his O
work, O
and O
also O
by O
the O
place O
of O
study O
[ O
28 O
]. O
However, O
it O
would O
be O
interesting O
to O
continue O
these O
surveys O
in O
order O
to O
try O
to O
highlight O
whether O
there O
is O
a O
group O
of O
plants O
typically O
“Hmong,” O
emerging O
from O
the O
plants O
used O
by O
herbalists. O
This O
study O
also O
points O
out O
that O
the O
Hmong O
use O
pattern O
of O
plants O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
traditional O
lowland O
Lao O
healers O
living O
mainly O
in O
southern O
Laos. O
In O
both O
groups, O
there O
is O
a O
predominant O
use O
of O
roots. O

Therefore, O
the O
clone O
F O
showed O
moderate O
resistant O
ability O
to O
CaHV, O
which O
is O
weaker O
than O
that O
of O
clone O
H O
(IFN O
system O

and O
Ig O
genes O
both O
up-regulated O
their O
expression) O
and O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
clone O
A O
+ O
(IFN O
system O
genes O
down-regulated O
and O
Ig O
genes O
up-regulated O
their O
expression). O
Moreover, O
susceptible O
clone O
A O
+ O
failed O
to O
trigger O
IFN O
antiviral O
response O
but O
activated O
myosins O
to O
increase O
the O
virus O
release O
and O
spread O
(Table O

Additional O

which O
resulted O
in O
the O
loss O
of O
battle O
between O
host O
and O
CaHV O
and O
severely O
impaired O
circulatory O
system O
(Fig. O

Thus, O
the O
further O
analysis O
are O
necessary O
to O
confirm O
the O
differential O

responses, O
to O

the O

Conclusions O
The O
current O
study O
represents O
a O
paradigm O
of O
differential O
innate O
and O
adaptive O
immune O
reactions O
among O
fishes O
with O
distinct O
resistance O
to O
virus. O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
differential O
regulation O
mechanism O
between O
innate O
and O
adaptive O
immunity O
may O
be O
the O
key O
reason O
for O
the O
distinct O
resistance O
to O
CaHV O
among O
the O
three O
gibel O

gynogenetic O
clones. O
The O
establishments O
of O
three O
gibel O
carp O
gynogenetic O
clones O
with O
distinct O
resistances O
to O
CaHV O
will O
provide O
a O

to O
definitely O
clarify O
the O
regulatory O
interactions O
among O
IFN O

Igs, O
myosins O
and O

in O

In O
addition, O
our O
studies O
will O
be O
helpful O
to O
the O

To O
answer O
that O
question O
we O
conducted O
experiments O
following O
an O

approach O
based O
on O
the O
observation O
that O

To O
that O
end, O

with O
IFN-α, O

or O
a O

both O
in O
the O

To O
perform O
these O

instead O
of O

we O
worked O
with O
the O
compound O

Here, O
a O

Similar O
to O
the O
results O
discussed O
in O
previous O
studies O
[ O

also O
showed O
that O

behaviors O
as O

play O

An O
increasing O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
changes O
in O
AST O
function O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
occurrence O
of O
a O
variety O
of O
neuropsychiatric O
diseases O
[ O

Depression O
or O
long-term O
psychological O
stress O
can O
cause O
changes O
in O
the O
morphology, O
function O
and O
plasticity O
of O
ASTs, O
suggesting O
that O
changes O
in O
AST O
function O
may O
be O
one O
of O
the O
related O
mechanisms O
of O
stress O
pathogenesis. O
Other O
studies O
have O
found O
that O
ASTs O
are O
also O
involved O
in O
the O
active O
regulation O
of O
neurons, O
the O
most O
important O
regulatory O
mechanism O
of O
which O
is O
control O
of O
the O
metabolism O
of O
glutamate O
in O
extracellular O
fluid. O
ASTs O
can O
transport O
extracellular O
glutamate O
into O
glial O
cells O
through O
the O
functional O
glutamate O
transporter O
and O
reduce O
the O
extracellular O
glutamate O
concentration, O
thereby O
alleviating O
the O
toxic O
effects O
of O
glutamate O
[ O
30 O
]. O
GFAP O
acts O
as O
a O
specific O
scaffolding O
protein O
for O
ASTs, O
and O
its O
expression O
changes O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
stress O
response. O
Banasr O
found O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
GFAP O
in O
the O
PFC O
of O
rats O
with O
agnostic O
chronic O
stress O
was O
significantly O
decreased, O
which O
also O
indicated O
the O
decline O
of O
AST O
function O
in O
the O
PFC O
of O
chronically O
stressed O
rats. O
When O
glutamate O
is O
released O
into O
the O
synaptic O
cleft, O
it O
will O
occupy O
and O
activate O
glutamate O
receptors O
in O
synaptic O
neurons O
and O
ASTs, O
and O
subsequently, O
glutamate O
is O
rapidly O
transferred O
out O
of O
the O
synaptic O
gap O
by O
a O
family O
of O
serosal O
EAATs O
located O
in O
neurons O
and O
ASTs. O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Since O
extracellular O
glutamate-free O
enzyme O
systems O
are O
involved, O
extracellular O
excess O
glutamate O
clearance O
relies O
primarily O
on O
EAAT O
transport. O

The O

His O
medical O

The O

These O

were O
also O
observed O
in O
a O
previous O

conducted O
by O
Michelle O
J. O
Chandley, O

who O
found O
that O

of O
decedents O
who O
had O
MDD O
and O
tissue O
samples O
from O

were O
similar, O
while O
the O
protein O

were O
reduced O
in O
MDD O
samples O
compared O
with O
those O
in O
matched O
control O
samples O
[ O
40 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
we O
observed O
a O
significant O
reduction O
in O
GFAP O
immunoreactivity, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
Western O

and O
in O
GFAP-immunostained O
tissue O
sections. O
Reduced O
GFAP O
immunoreactivity O
in O
depression O
animal O
models O
has O
been O
reported O
for O
hippocampi O
and O
PFC O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Hence, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
suspect O
that O
the O
reduction O
in O
GFAP O
immunoreactivity O
in O
the O
present O
study O
may O
be O
a O
regulatory O
event O
in O
existing O
ASTs. O
Additionally, O
NeuN O
expression O
was O
assayed O
by O
Western O
blotting. O
and O
NeuN-immunostained O
tissue O
sections O
showed O
a O
decrease O
in O
neuronal O
cells. O
These O
results O
are O
further O
supported O
by O
a O
series O
of O
related O
studies, O
which O
reported O
that O
NeuN O
protein O

in O

was O
reduced O
in O
hippocampi O
[ O
42 O
, O

and O
PFC O
[ O

However, O
the O
mRNA O
expression O
of O
NeuN O
in O
the O
PFC O
of O
CUMS O
mice O
observed O
in O
the O
present O
study O
was O
similar O
to O
that O
in O
mice O
of O
the O
control O
group, O
indicating O
the O
result O
was O
not O
accidental. O
Liu O
et O

found O
that O
NeuN O
protein O
and O
gene O
expression O
in O
a O
chronic O
unpredictable O
stress O
model O
of O
depression O
was O
not O
reduced O
compared O
with O
that O
of O
a O
control O
group O
[ O
45 O
]. O
Ding O
et O
al. O
reported O
a O
decrease O
in O
NeuN O
mRNA O
levels; O
however, O
these O
results O
could O
not O
be O
further O
confirmed O
by O
immunohistochemical O
analysis. O

Cyp2d9 O
is O
also O
upregulated O
in O
lipopolysaccharide O

as O
well O
as O
in O
mice O
infected O
with O
the O
intestinal O
bacterial O
pathogen O
Citrobacter O

[ O

]. O
Interestingly, O
DMEs O
could O
be O
categorized O
based O
on O
profiling O
the O
time O
course O
of O
their O
transcription. O
These O
different O
transcriptional O
time O
courses O
suggest O
that O
there O
are O
multiple O
mechanisms O
of O
regulation O
of O
the O
enzymes O
during O
Plasmodium O
infection. O
However, O
some O
of O
the O
differences O
in O
time O
course O
could O
reflect O
differences O
in O
mRNA O
stability O
between O
transcripts O
for O
different O

The O
fact O
that O
most O

reach O
their O

at O

suggests O
that O
hepatic O

is O
not O
the O
main O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
down-regulation O
of O
Sult3a1 O
and O

does O
correlate O
with O
liver O

which O
may O

such O
a O
mechanism O
for O
these O

Since O
these O

caution O

be O

these O

Moreover, O

On O
the O

we O

Several O

reported O
that O

For O

Harman O

have O
demonstrated O
that O

were O
profoundly O
decreased O
in O
human O

Moreover, O
cathepsin O
L O
protein O
level O
was O
increased O
in O
cells O
infected O
with O
HIV-1. O
These O
studies O
suggest O
that O
the O
reduction O

possibly O
impairs O
late O
endosomal O
degradation O

resulting O
in O

Moreover, O
authors O
hypothesized O
that O

may O
lead O
to O
decrease O

However, O
the O
tight O
regulation O

can O
in O

be O
overcome O
by O
bicarbonate, O
which O
is O
present O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O

as O
demonstrated O
recently O
24 O
. O
Alternatively, O
as O
hypothesized O
here, O
the O
MI O
metabolism O
might O
be O
supported O
by O
the O
common O
virulence O
regulator O
SsrB. O
SsrB O
has O
also O

that O

located O
on O
the O

island O
41 O

, O
62 O
. O
Together O
with O
the O
sensor O
SsrA O
(SpiR), O
the O
response O
regulator O
SsrB O
forms O
a O
two-component O
system O
that O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
induction O
of O
the O

located O
type O

and O
effector O
proteins O
essential O
for O
survival O
in O

63 O
. O
In O
our O
study, O
we O
confirm O
the O
observation O
that O
SsrB O
binds O
to O
a O
site O
within O
GEI4417/4436 O
38 O
, O
namely O
the O
rssR O
promoter, O
and O
demonstrate O
that O
SsrB O
can O
activate O
the O
novel O
sRNA O
RssR, O
but O
is O
not O
required O
for O
RssR O
expression O
in O
medium O
with O
MI O
as O
sole O
carbon O
and O
energy O
source. O
SsrB O
induction O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
expression O
in O
macrophages O
and O
recently O
in O
its O
unphosphorylated O
form O
to O
biofilm O
formation O
43 O
, O
whereas O
MI O
utilization O
is O
not O
induced O
inside O
macrophages O
64 O
, O
65 O
. O
However, O
recent O
studies O
show O
that O
the O
SsrB-regulated O
SPI-2 O
genes O
are O
already O
expressed O
in O
the O
gut O
lumen O
66 O
, O
67 O
where O
the O
expression O
of O
iol O
genes O
might O
additionally O
be O
favored O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
bicarbonate. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
mature O
RssR O
is O
produced O
by O
processing O
of O
the O
iolB O
mRNA O
or O
of O
an O
RssR O

that O
is O

within O
the O
iolB O

region O
by O
SsrB O

other O
regulatory O
factors, O
or O
both. O
As O
SsrB O
binding O
to O
a O
site O
within O
iolB O
might O
impair O
transcription O
of O
this O
gene, O
we O
hypothesize O
an O

stimulate O
the O

The O

the O

Initially, O
the O

the O

[ O

Moreover, O
the O

disclosed O
the O
functionality O

lncRNA O
MBNL1-AS1 O
as O
a O
molecular O
sponge O

The O
active O

The O

Studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O

So O
far, O
vancomycin O
has O
been O
the O
most O

The O

In O

The O

transfers O
the O

Then O
the O
regulator O

In O

Severe O

occur O
more O
often O

Education O
and O
socialization O
Most O
children O
with O
A-T O
have O
difficulty O
in O
school O
because O
of O
a O
delay O
in O
response O
time O
to O
visual, O
verbal O
or O
other O
cues, O
dysarthria, O
oculomotor O
apraxia O
and O
impaired O
fine O

control. O
Despite O
these O
problems, O
children O
with O
A-T O
often O
enjoy O
school O
if O
proper O
accommodations O
to O
their O
disability O
can O
be O
made. O
The O
decision O
about O
the O
need O
for O
special O
education O
classes O
or O
extra O
help O
in O
regular O
classes O
is O
highly O
influenced O
by O
the O
local O
resources O
available. O
Decisions O
about O
proper O
educational O
placement O
should O
be O
revisited O
as O
often O
as O
circumstances O
warrant. O
Despite O
their O
many O
neurologic O
impairments, O
most O
individuals O
with O
A-T O
are O
very O
socially O
aware O
and O
socially O
skilled, O
and O
thus O
benefit O
from O
sustained O
peer O
relationships O
developed O
at O
school. O
Some O
individuals O
are O
able O
to O
function O
quite O
well O
despite O
their O
disabilities O
and O
a O
few O
have O
graduated O
from O
college. O
Many O
of O
the O
problems O
encountered O
will O
benefit O
from O
special O
attention, O
as O
problems O
are O
often O
related O
more O
to O
“input O
and O
output” O
issues O
than O
to O
intellectual O
impairment. O
Problems O
with O
eye O
movement O
control O
make O
it O
difficult O
for O
people O
with O
A-T O
to O
read, O
yet O
most O
fully O
understand O
the O
meaning O
and O
nuances O
of O
text O
that O
is O
read O
to O
them. O
Delays O
in O
speech O
initiation O
and O
lack O
of O
facial O
expression O
make O
it O
seem O
that O
they O
do O
not O
know O
the O
answers O
to O
questions. O
Reduction O
of O
the O
skilled O
effort O
needed O
to O
answer O
questions, O
and O
an O
increase O
of O
the O
time O
available O
to O
respond, O
is O
often O
rewarded O
by O
real O
accomplishment. O
It O
is O
important O
to O
recognize O
that O
intellectual O
disability O
is O
not O
regularly O
a O
part O
of O
the O
clinical O
picture O
of O
A-T O
although O
school O
performance O
may O
be O
suboptimal O
because O
of O
the O
many O
difficulties O
in O
reading, O
writing, O
and O
speech. O
Children O
with O
A-T O
are O
often O
very O
conscious O
of O
their O
appearance, O
and O
strive O
to O
appear O
normal O
to O
their O
peers O
and O
teachers. O
Life O
within O
the O
ataxic O
body O
can O
be O
tiring. O

For O
instance, O
four O
novel O
prenylated O
depsidones O
had O
been O
isolated O
from O
the O
chloroform O
soluble O
fraction O
of O
the O
leaves O
of O
G. O
parvifolia. O
[ O
30 O
]. O
The O
leaf O
extracts O
also O
displayed O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
new O
benzoquinone O
derivative, O
namely O
parvifoliquinone O
and O
six O
other O
known O
compounds O
namely O
parvifoliol O
B, O
C O
(phloroglucinols), O
parvifoliol O
E O
(benzopyran O
derivatives), O
garcidepsidone O
B O
(depsidone), O
nigrolineaisoflavone O
A O
(isoflavone-like O
compound) O
and O
mangostinone O
(xanthone) O
[ O
31 O
]. O
Some O
depsidones O
have O
shown O
to O
be O
active O
against O
HIV O
by O
inhibiting O
the O
viral O
integrase O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Using O
molecular O
screening O
and O
docking O
investigations, O
certain O
Garcinia O
phytochemicals, O
including O
garcidepsidone O
had O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
potential O
inhibitors O
to O
inhibit O
the O
dengue O
viral O
replication O
inside O
the O
host O
cell O
with O
the O
help. O
Further O
in-vitro O
investigations O
require O
confirming O
their O
efficacy O
[ O
33 O
]. O
Clusianone O
had O
been O
isolated O
in O
abundance O
from O
the O
leaves O
of O
G. O
parvifolia O
through O
hexane O
extraction O
[ O
34 O
]. O
Recently, O
the O
anti-proliferative O
potential O
of O
structurally O
modified O
clusianone O
and O
its O
derivatives O
has O
been O
shown O
[ O
35 O
, O
36 O
]. O
A O
significant O
correlation O
was O
reported O
on O
the O
structure O
activity O
relationship O
of O
clusianone O
against O
Respiratory O
Carcinoma O
Cells O
via O

[ O

Additionally, O
sugars O
as O
signal O
molecules O
may O
regulate O
gene O
expression O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
metabolic O
processes O
through O
hexokinase-dependent O
and O
independent O
pathways O
(Couée O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
Lastdrager O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Kunz O
et O
al. O
2014 O
, O
2015 O
). O
Several O
reports O
have O
indicated O
that O
stress O
conditions O
affect O
sugar O
metabolism, O
e.g., O
cadmium O
stress O
led O
to O
decrease O
in O
invertases O
and O
SuSy O
activity O
in O
pea O
(Devi O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
Wounding O
has O
been O
evidenced O
to O
reduce O
sucrose O
content O
in O
sugar O
beet O
and O
sugar O
cane O
(Rosenkranz O
et O
al. O
2001 O
; O
Chandra O
et O
al. O
2012 O
), O
while O
phosphate O
deficiency O
increased O
glucose O
and O
starch O
content O
in O
bean O
or O
A. O
thaliana O
leaves O
(Ciereszko O
and O
Barbachowska O
2000 O
; O
Ciereszko O
and O
Kleczkowski O
2005 O
). O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
cold O
stress O
has O
resulted O
in O
accumulation O
of O
glucose, O
fructose, O
sucrose O
and O
starch O
(Strand O
et O
al. O
1997 O
). O
It O
has O
been O
established O
that O
mechanical O
wounding O
induces O
expression O
and O
the O
activity O
of O
cell O
wall O
and O
vacuolar O
invertases O
in O
the O
sugar O
beet O
tap-root O
(Rosenkranz O
et O
al. O
2001 O
). O
Photosynthesis O
and O
respiration O
intensities O
are O
often O
affected O
by O
stress, O
as O
well O
(Quilliam O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
Lafta O
and O
Fugate O
2011 O
). O
Chlorophyll O
a O
fluorescence O
during O
photosynthesis O
is O
low; O
however, O
disturbances O
in O
this O
process O
provoked O
by O
stress O
usually O
intensify O
the O
fluorescence O
emission O
(Baker O
and O
Rosenqvist O
2004 O
). O
Moreover, O
co-regulation O
of O
photosynthesis O
and O
carbohydrate O
metabolism O
may O
influence O
enzyme O
activity O
and O
whole O
plant O
metabolism O
(Berger O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
Sugars O
can O
activate O
specific O
hormone-crosstalk O
transduction O
pathways, O
resulting O
in O
modifications O
of O
various O
gene O
expression O
and O
enzyme O
activity O
(León O
and O
Sheen O
2003 O
; O
Lastdrager O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Ljung O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
Sugar O
production, O
transport, O
and O
metabolism O
are O
modified O
by O
hormones. O

This O
is O
a O
relatively O
high O
number O
for O
prokaryotes, O
as O
most O
sequenced O
bacterial O
genomes O
generally O
contain O
a O
small O
number O
of O
CYP O
genes. O
The O
high O
abundance O
of O
CYP O
genes O
is O
a O
general O
characteristic O
of O
mycobacteria O
exemplified O
by O
Mycobacterium O
rhodesiae O
NBB3 O
(70), O
Mycobacterium O
avium O
104 O
(48), O
Mycobacterium O
marinum O
(47), O
Mycobacterium O
smegmatis O
MC2 O
(42), O
and O
Mycobacterium O
abscessus O
47J26s/103 O
(25) O
as O
compiled O
by O
Parvez O
et O
al. O
( O
2016 O
). O
In O
contrast, O
Mycobacterium O
leprae O
has O
lost O
all O
but O
one O
functional O
CYP O
protein, O
encoded O
by O
ML2088c O
(37% O
identity O
to O
Mtb O
CYP140A1). O
However, O
this O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
overall O
reduction O
in O
genome O
size O
in O
M. O
leprae. O
Deciphering O
the O
physiological O
function O
of O
CYPs O
is O
usually O
performed O
through O
a O
combination O
of O
homology O
modeling/mapping, O
generation O
of O
single O
gene O
knockouts O
and/or O
biochemical O
characterization O
of O
the O
protein. O
Yet, O
despite O
the O
high O
abundance O
of O
CYP O
genes O
in O
mycobacteria, O
phylogenetic O
analysis O
has O
shown O
that O
Mtb O
CYPs O
exhibit O
relatively O
low O
evolutionary O
relationships O
with O
other O
species, O
with O
many O
bacterial O
species O
(like O
Escherichia O
coli) O
lacking O
CYPs O
altogether. O
CYP121A1, O
CYP128A1, O
CYP135, O
and O
CYP141A1 O
are O
predominantly O
found O
in O
mycobacteria O
belonging O
to O
the O
MTBC O
(Ouellet O
et O
al. O
2010a O
). O
In O
addition, O
the O
overall O
homology O
between O
the O
20 O
Mtb O
CYPs O
is O
rather O
low, O
with O
a O
maximum O
homology O
of O
40% O
between O
CYP135A1 O
and O
CYP135B1 O
in O
Mtb. O
The O
catalytic O
activity O
of O
CYPs O
is O
dependent O
on O
their O
redox O
partners O
(McLean O
et O
al. O
2005 O
). O
CYPs O
are O
classified O
based O
on O
the O
type O
of O
redox O
systems O
they O
pair O

[ O

Among O

diffuse O

lymphoma O
(DLBCL) O
is O
the O
most O

subtype, O
whereas O
mantle O

is O
relatively O
rare O
[ O

]. O
Chronic O
lymphocytic O
leukaemia O
(CLL), O
another O
B O

malignancy, O
is O
the O
most O

leukaemia. O
Chemotherapy O
is O
still O
the O
cornerstone O
in O
the O

of O
these O
diseases, O
often O
accompanied O
by O
monoclonal O
antibodies O
against O
the O
CD20 O
antigen O
[ O
3 O

]. O
However, O
targeted O
therapies O
like O
Bruton’s O
tyrosine O

and O
BCL-2 O

are O
emerging O
as O
novel O
treatment O
options, O
particularly O
in O
MCL O
and O
CLL O
[ O

Survival O
rates O
for O
these O
haematological O
diseases O
have O
improved O
over O
recent O
decades O
[ O

However, O
many O

will O
still O
relapse O

to O
chemotherapy, O
anti-CD20 O
therapy O
and O
even O
the O
novel O

treatments O
[ O

Consequently, O
there O
is O
a O
medical O
need O
for O
new O

showed O
that O
the O
ε-PL O
could O
inhibit O
primary O
metabolic O
pathways O
of O
S. O

(Bo O
et O

2014 O
). O
However, O
to O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
the O
effect O
of O
ε-PL O
on O
the O
metabolism O
of O
prokaryotic O
microorganisms O
has O
not O
been O
reported. O
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
(S. B-PATH
aureus) I-PATH
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
major O
food-borne O
pathogens O
that O
causes O
diverse O
symptoms O
of O
food O
poisoning. O
Therefore, O
S. B-PATH
aureus I-PATH
has O
a O
serious O
threat O
to O
food O
safety O
due O
to O
its O
high O
tolerance O
to O
salt O
and O
the O
stability O
of O
its O
toxins O
at O
high O
temperature O
(Miao O
et O

2016 O
; O
Chang O
et O

). O
Furthermore, O
in O

S. O

has O
also O
been O
used O
as O
a O

Up O

now, O

in O
the O

suggesting O
that O
the O
appressorial O
turgor O

in O

was O
not O
due O
to O

To O
further O
understand O
the O
mechanism O
of O
turgor O
reduction O
in O
the O
mutants, O
we O
examined O
the O
appressorial O
melanin O

which O
is O
necessary O
for O

by O
preventing O

This O
group O
includes O
nine O
historically O
known O
serotypes O
(Ia, O
Ib, O
II, O
III, O
IV, O
V, O
VI, O
VII, O
VIII) O
and O
a O
further O
(IX) O
of O
more O
recent O
identification O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
The O
discrimination O
of O
the O
different O
serotypes O
depends O
on O
type-specific O
capsular O
polysaccharides O
that O
constitute O
also O
a O
virulence O
factor, O
through O
which O
GBS O
eludes O
the O
host O
immune O
response O
[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
However, O
the O
expression O
of O
specific O
polysaccharides O
at O
the O
extracellular O
level O
is O
not O
the O
only O
invasion O
mechanism O
used O
by O
S. O
agalactiae. O
Indeed, O
analogously O
to O
other O
microorganisms O
[ O
5 O
], O
S. O
agalactiae O
is O
able O
to O
produce O
biofilm, O
a O
polysaccharide O
matrix O
that O
allows O
bacteria O
to O
hide O
from O
the O
immune O
system, O
favoring O
its O
persistence O
when O
environmental O
conditions O
are O
adverse O
[ O
6 O
]. O
Despite O
these O
pathogenic O
features, O
S. O
agalactiae O
is O
generally O
harmless O
for O
human O
health, O
being O
a O
commensal O
commonly O
present O
in O
the O
lower O
genital O
and O
gastroenteric O
tract O
of O
healthy O
women O
[ O
7 O
]. O
The O
screening O
for O
the O
identification O
of O
GBS O
becomes O
essential O
in O
pregnant O
women, O
due O
to O
a O
serious O
risk O
for O
newborn O
to O
contract O
the O
infection O
during O
birth. O
Data O
regarding O
the O
incidence O
of O
S. B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
infections O
in O
newborns O
are O
decidedly O
not O
encouraging. O
Accordingly, O
S. B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
is O
responsible O
for O
between O
114,000 O
and O
204,000 O
invasive O
cases O
and O
147,000 O
stillbirths O
and O
infant O
deaths O
every O
year O
worldwide. O
Furthermore, O
the O
neonatal O
mortality O
rates, O
ranging O
from O
10 O
to O
15% O
and O
40 O
to O
58% O
in O
developed O
and O
developing O
countries, O
respectively, O
clearly O
confirm O
that O
vertical O
transmission O
of O
S. B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
still O
represents O
an O
emergency O
worldwide O
[ O
8 O
– O
10 O
]. O
These O
numbers O
reflect O
a O
diffused O
and O
homogeneous O
vaginal O
and O
rectal O
GBS O
colonization O
among O
pregnant O
women O
worldwide, O
with O
some O
variations O
between O
the O
different O
regions O
of O
the O
world. O
In O
Europe, O
the O
variation O
of O
the O
colonization O
rate O
is O
around O
7.1 O
to O
16% O
[ O
11 O
, O
12 O
]. O

However, O
we O
detected O
∼100-fold O
fewer O
bacteria O
in O
the O
spleens O
of O
mice O
infected O
with O
the O
ancestral O
I259 O
variant O
of O
Pla O
compared O
with O
Pla O
T259 O
in O
both O
the O
ancestral O
and O
modern O
strains O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
( O
Fig. O
5b O
). O
Moreover, O
Pestoides O
F O
is O
able O
to O
outgrow O
in O
the O
lymph O
node; O
however, O
it O
only O
disseminates O
to O
distal O
sites O
by O
day O
3 O
when O
harbouring O
pPCP1 O
( O
Fig. O
5b O
). O
Thus, O
these O
observations O
indicate O
that O
the O
I259T O
modification O
of O
Pla O
was O
important O
for O
Y. O
pestis O
to O
cause O
a O
disseminated, O
invasive O
infection O
from O
the O
site O
of O
inoculation, O
such O
as O
occurs O
during O
bubonic O
plague, O
in O
both O
modern O
and O
ancestral O
strains O
of O
Y. O
pestis. O
Discussion O
The O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
new O
bacterial O
pathogens O
emerge O
are O
not O
well O
understood, O
particularly O
in O
regards O
to O
the O
specific O
gain O
or O
loss O
of O
individual O
genetic O
determinants O
that O
enable O
the O
adaptation O
and O
development O
of O
acute O
disease O
in O
discrete O
hosts O
and/or O
microenvironments. O
These O
genetic O
changes O
are O
believed O
to O
account O
for O
phenotypic O
distinctions O
and O
pathogenic O
potential O
observed O
between O
lineages O
of O
Y. O
pestis, O
as O
genetic O
diversity O
is O
a O
known O
source O
of O
phenotypic O
diversity O
underlying O
disease O
dynamics. O

, O

However, O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
that O
Y. O
pestis O
acquired O
to O
specifically O
become O
a O
severe O
respiratory O
pathogen O
are O
not O
yet O
established, O
despite O
several O
comparative O
genomic, O
transcriptomic O
and O
proteomic O
studies O
6 O
, O
8 O
, O
41 O
. O
Before O
this O
study, O
it O
was O
unknown O
whether O
ancestral O
strains O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
were O
capable O
of O
causing O
primary O
pneumonic O
plague O
and O
at O
what O
point O
during O
the O
evolution O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
they O
became O
competent O
to O
do O
so. O
Here O
we O
report O
that O
ancestral, O
branch O
0 O
strains O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
gained O
the O
ability O
to O
successfully O
replicate O
to O
high O
levels O
within O
the O
pulmonary O
compartment O
very O
early O
in O
their O

only O
if O

Introduction O
Protozoa O
of O
the O
genus O
Cryptosporidium O
are O
common O
parasites O
of O
domestic O
and O
wild O
animals—mammals, O
birds, O
reptiles, O
and O
fishes O
(Zehedi O
et O
al. O
2015 O
; O
Osman O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
Yu O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
The O
invasive O
forms O
for O
all O
hosts O
are O
thick-walled O
oocysts, O
strongly O
resistant O
for O
chlorine O
disinfection, O
which O
can O
be O
present O
in O
water O
supplies, O
on O
fruits, O
vegetables, O
or O
in O
the O
soil O
contaminated O
with O
feces O
(Toledo O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
Squire O
and O
Ryan O
2017 O
; O
Domenech O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
The O
most O
important O
way O
of O
transmission O
of O
these O
parasites O
is O
the O
fecal-oral O
route, O
by O
swallowing O
oocysts O
with O
contaminated O
food O
or O
nontreated O
water O
or O
during O
recreational O
water O
events O
(lakes, O
rivers, O
and O
swimming O
pools) O
(Hall O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
Fill O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
Hlavsa O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
The O
presence O
of O
Cryptosporidium O
spp. O
and O
Giardia B-PATH
intestinalis I-PATH
in O
waste O
water O
is O
a O
main O
concern O
because O
water O
reuse O
for O
irrigation O
can O
jeopardize O
human O
health O
(Domenech O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
The O
direct O
way O
of O
transmission O
from O
person O
to O
person O
of O
these O
apicomplexan O
parasites O
is O
also O
possible, O
that O
is O
why O
human, O
especially O
asymptomatic O
carrier, O
becomes O
a O
possible O
source O
of O
infection O
for O
his O
surroundings, O
creating O
a O
serious O
epidemiological O
threat. O
Cryptosporidium O
trophozoites O
exist O
in O
the O
enterocytes O
and O
are O
responsible O
for O
their O
damage O
causing O
gastrointestinal O
symptoms O
such O
as O
watery O
diarrhea O
and O
abdominal O
cramps O
(Bouzid O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
The O
pathologic O
process O
in O
an O
immunocompetent O
host O
is O
usually O
self-limiting, O
but O
sometimes, O
protracted O
infections O
can O
be O
present. O
In O
such O
cases, O
chronic O
diarrhea O
lasts O
longer O
than O
4–6 O
weeks O
(Sandhu O
and O
Surawicz O
2012 O
). O
Persistent O
intestinal O
disorders O
are O
present O
mainly O
in O
persons O
suffering O
from O
different O
types O
of O
immunodeficiency. O

Indeed, O
we O
do O
not O
always O
need O
to O
go O
far O
to O
find O
diverse O
samples O
(e.g. O
Hill O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Nettle O
2017 O
; O
Wilson O
2011 O
; O
Wilson O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
WEIRD O
samples O
themselves O
are O
certainly O
not O
homogeneous, O
and O
for O
instance O
even O
people O
from O
different O
neighbourhoods O
within O
the O

can O
vary O
as O
much O
as O
people O
from O
entirely O
different O
cultures O
(Nettle O
2017 O
; O
Nettle O
et O
al. O
2011 O
). O
Thus, O
even O
samples O
from O
WEIRD O
cultures O
can O
be O
sufficiently O
diverse O
that O
they O
provide O
some O
useful O
evidence O
in O
support O
of O
generalisability. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
evolutionary O
psychologists O
are O
often O
keen O
to O
sample O
outside O
WEIRD O
populations O
because O
of O
their O
interest O
in O
assessing O
and O
recording O
the O
nature O
of O
humans O
as O
a O
species. O
WEIRD O
populations O
may O
experience O
environments O
(in O
terms O
of O
novel O
technology, O
experience O
of O
hunger, O
exposure O
to O
death O
and O
so O
on) O
that O
are O
particularly O
dissimilar O
from O
those O
experienced O
by O
many O
of O
our O
ancestors, O
something O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
borne O
in O
mind O
when O
constructing O
and O
testing O
evolutionary O
theories O
of O
behaviour. O
Human O
universals O
(Brown O
1991 O
, O
2000 O
) O
may O
only O
be O
uncovered O
following O
assessment O
of O
multiple O
human O
populations, O
if O
not O
all O
populations, O
and O
assist O
in O
developing O
and O
evaluating O
evolutionary O
theories O
of O
behaviour. O
If O
we O
are O
to O
test O
how O
individual O
differences O
may O
be O
functionally O
adaptive O
(Tybur O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Wilson O
1998 O
), O
we O
need O
to O
compare O
individuals O
from O
different O
ecological O
settings O
(Nettle O
2009 O
). O
An O
awareness O
of O
the O
diversity O
of O
worldwide O
human O
behaviours O
would O
help O
us O
understand O
how O
human O
behaviours O
emerge O
from O
an O
interaction O
between O
local O
ecologies O
and O
our O
evolved O
brains O
(Henrich O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
For O
these O
sorts O
of O
reasons, O
classic O
studies O
that O
seek O
to O
test O
adaptive O
reasoning O
have O
taken O
pains O
to O
survey O
different O
populations O
(e.g. O
Buss O
1989 O
; O

1988 O
; O

In O
the O

of O
Microbiome, O
Davis O
et O
al. O
present O
an O
elegant O
approach O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
contamination O
in O
metagenomic O
sequencing O
results O
[ O
22 O
]. O
Their O
approach O
relies O
on O
two O
core O
principles: O
first, O
that O
contaminant O
sequences O
are O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
total O
sequencing O
reads O
(the O
frequency-based O
approach), O
and O
second, O
that O
contaminant O
sequences O
are O
present O
in O
more O
controls O
than O
samples O
(the O
prevalence-based O
approach). O
Their O
work O
employs O
several O
statistical O
methods O
that O
culminate O
in O
a O
classification O
threshold O
ranging O
from O
0 O
to O
1. O
Once O
the O
threshold O
is O
set O
(the O
authors O
recommend O
0.1 O
to O
start), O
a O
list O
of O
contaminant O
DNA O
can O
be O
compiled. O
Analyzing O
sequences O
according O
to O
these O
principles O
eliminates O
the O
need O
to O
assign O
an O
arbitrary O
threshold O
for O
removing O
sequences O
and O
reduces O
reliance O
on O
an O
a O
priori O
set O
list O
of O
known O
contaminants. O

Selection O
of O
the O
cells O
to O
analyze O
was O
dictated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
dendritic O
cells O
are O
in O
the O
forefront O
of O
subsequent O
immune O
responses O
ensuing O
infection. O
But O
to O
be O
able O
to O
attribute O
any O
changes O
to O
the O
viral O
activity O
only O
and O
not O
to O
the O
virus-induced O
apoptotic O
process, O
we O
first O
determined O
the O
apoptotic O
rate O
in O
murine O
JAWS O
II O
and O
GM-BM O
cells. O
ECTV O
infection O
of O
JAWS O
II O
cells O
at O
a O
low O
MOI O
(0.5) O
induces O
early O
apoptosis O
at O
24 O
h O
following O
infection, O
in O
contrast O
to O
GM-BM O
cells O
in O
which O
the O
induction O
of O
apoptosis O
was O
not O
detected O
during O
the O
entire O
virus O
replication O
cycle. O
Therefore, O
the O
observation O
at O
12 O
and O
24 O
hpi O
in O
both O
cells O
types O
that O
expression O
of O
cathepsins O
and O
cystatins O
was O
significantly O
reduced, O
and O
degradation O
of O
DQ-OVA O
was O
altered, O
indicates O
that O
such O
inhibitory O
effects O
were O
not O
caused O
by O
the O
apoptotic O
process O
and O
may O
strictly O
be O
related O
to O
the O
immunomodulatory O
strategies O
engaged O
by O
the O
virus. O
Moreover, O
ECTV O
itself O
encodes O
a O
variety O
of O
proteins O
to O
overcome O
apoptosis O
[ O

including O
EVM025 O
that O
inhibits O
activity O
of O

and O

It O
is O
well O
documented O
that O
poxviruses O
cause O
a O
global O
shutdown O
of O
host O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
synthesis O
probably O
to O
facilitate O
their O
own O
replication O
due O
to O
deactivation O

restriction O
of O
competition O
for O
the O
translational O
machinery O
[ O

]. O
This O
phenomenon O
would O
explain O
why O
both O
cathepsins O
and O
their O
negative O
regulator O
cystatins O
are O
downregulated O
in O
ECTV-infected O
cDCs. O
Interestingly, O
we O
observed O
that O
the O
mRNA O
expression O
for O
cathepsin O
B, O
S O
and O
cystatin O
C O
was O
primarily O
reduced O
in O

Its O
particular O
virulence O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
product O
of O
a O
number O
of O
adaptations. O
Well O
described O
are: O
the O
expression O

which O
assist O

colonisation; O
the O
ability O
to O
bind O

by O

a O
peptostreptococcal O
albumin-binding O
protein O
leading O

(the O
most O
common O

[ O

Whilst O
the O
infections O
above O
due O
to O
F. O
magna O
appear O
to O
be O
relatively O
common, O
confirmed O
infective O
endocarditis O
due O
to O
F. O
magna O
is O
notably O
more O
rare. O
A O
search O
of O
the O
English-language O

reveals O
eight O

of O

with O
F. B-PATH

Of O
note, O

negative O

cases, O
with O
definitive O

made O
only O
by O
tissue O

obtained O
during O

[ O

Blood O
cultures O
yielded O
a O
positive O
microbiology O
result O
after O
four O
days O
in O
our O
case. O
Culture-negative O
infective O
endocarditis O
has O
a O
potentially O
negative O
impact O
on O
patient O
management, O
as O
this O
can O
lead O

and O
the O
initiation O
of O
the O
appropriate O
antibiotic O

[ O

Therefore, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
consider O

in O
a O

92) O
have O
argued, O
that O
‘perhaps O
no O
field O
of O
psychology O
is O
more O
strongly O
motivated O
and O
better O
equipped O
than O
evolutionary O
psychology O
to O
respond O
to O
the O
recent O
call O
for O
psychologists O
to O
expand O
their O
empirical O
base O
beyond O
WEIRD O
(Western O
Educated O

samples’. O
Similarly, O
Kurzban O
( O
2013 O
) O
argued O
on O
the O
Evolutionary O
Psychology O
blog O
that O
‘adding O
evolution O
to O
psychology O
makes O
the O
science O
less O
WEIRD’. O
He O
found O
that O
for O
the O
2012 O
volume, O
65% O
of O
the O
articles O
in O
the O
journal O
‘Evolution O
&amp; O
Human O
Behavior’ O
were O
WEIRD, O
which O
contrasts O
favourably O
with O
data O
for O
other O
fields O
as O
cited O
above. O
This O
initial O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
evolutionary O
psychology O
is O
indeed O
less O
WEIRD O
than O
some O
subdivisions O
of O
psychology. O
Here, O
we O
examine O
the O
samples O
used O
in O
two O
leading O
evolutionary O
psychology O
journals O
in O
more O
depth. O
We O
have O
no O
explicit O
hypotheses, O
but O
rather O
describe O
the O
samples O
used O
in O
these O
two O
journals O
according O
to O
their O
geographical O
origin, O
age O
group O
(adult O
or O
child), O
student O
status O
and O
source O
(online O
vs. O
offline). O
In O
addition, O
we O
test O
whether O
the O
sample O
sizes O
vary O
based O
on O
these O
categories. O
Our O
aim O
is O
to O
provide O
an O
up-to-date O
snapshot O
of O
contemporary O
evolutionary O
psychology O
sampling O
practice, O
while O
responding O
to O
calls O
to O
increase O
description O
within O
science O
(Scott-Phillips O
2018 O
); O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
move O
forward O
if O
we O
better O
know O
where O
we O
currently O
stand. O

To O

In O
the O

study, O
we O
used O
mice O
deficient O
in O
NLRP3, O

generated O
MGO-induced O
peritoneal O

which O
is O
an O
excellent O
murine O
model O
for O
human O
PD-related O
peritoneal O

We O
clearly O
showed O
that O
deficiency O
of O
NLRP3, O
ASC, O
or O
IL-1β O
reduced O
inflammatory O
and O
fibrotic O
responses O
in O
a O
MGO-induced O
peritoneal O

model. O
MGO O
also O
caused O
peritoneal O
bleeding O
and O
fibrin O
deposition, O
and O
subsequently O
promoted O
peritoneal O
fibrosis, O
all O
of O
these O
manifestations O
were O
inhibited O
by O
ASC O
deficiency. O
In O

experiments O
showed O
that O
MGO O
generated O
reactive O

and O
induced O
cell O

in O
endothelial O

which O
was O
inhibited O
by O
ASC O

The O
present O
findings O
showed O
that O
endothelial O
NLRP3 O
inflammasome O
contributes O
to O
peritoneal O
inflammatory O
and O
fibrotic O
responses O
in O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
PD-related O
peritoneal O

and O
provide O
new O
insights O

the O

Results O
Inflammasome-related O
proteins O
were O
up-regulated O
in O
MGO-induced O
peritoneal O

To O
produce O
a O
murine O
model O
of O
MGO-induced O
peritoneal O
fibrosis, O
we O
injected O
MGO O
(40 O
mM) O
intraperitoneally O
into O
wild-type O
(WT) O
mice, O
and O
Masson’s O
Trichrome O

showed O
that O
MGO O
significantly O
induced O
fibrous O
thickening O
of O
the O
parietal O
peritoneum O
in O
a O
time-dependent O
manner O
(Fig. O

). O
We O
next O
assessed O
the O
expression O
of O
inflammasome-related O
proteins O
by O
using O
real-time O
RT-PCR O
analysis O
and O
found O
that O
the O
peritoneal O
expression O
of O
NLRP3, O
ASC, O
caspase-1, O
and O
IL-1β O
was O
elevated O
in O
a O
time-dependent O
manner, O
and O
this O
increase O
was O
statistically O
significant O
at O
21 O
days O
after O
MGO O
treatment O
(Fig. O

). O

Cell O
wall O
synthesis O
is O
crucial O
for O
bacterial O
division O
and O
growth, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
very O
important O
target O
of O
antibiotics, O
such O
as O
penicillin, O
vancomycin, O
and O
teicoplanin. O
With O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
MRSA O
strains, O
vancomycin O
has O
become O
the O
first O
choice O
to O
treat O
staphylococcal O
infections. O
The O
use O
of O
vancomycin O
has O
led O
to O
the O
emergence O
of O
vancomycin-intermediate O
Staphylococcus O
aureus O
(VISA). O
Typically, O
VISA O
exhibits O
thick O
cell O
walls O
and O
reduced O
autolysis O
rates. O
Our O
study O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
airSR O
mutation O
exhibited O
both O
reduced O
viability O
in O
vancomycin O
and O
attenuated O
autolysis. O
We O
speculated O
that, O
the O
affected O
expression O
of O
cell O
wall O
metabolism-related O
genes O
owing O
to O
the O
airSR O
mutation O
caused O
the O
reduction O
in O
cell O
viability O
due O
to O
vancomycin. O
Attenuated O
autolysis O
may O
be O
a O
compensatory O
mechanism O
for O
the O
affected O
cell O
wall O
synthesis. O
The O
reduction O
of O
viability O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
vancomycin O
and O
the O
attenuation O
of O
autolysis O
are O
two O
independent O
outcomes O
of O
the O
airSR O
mutation. O
One O
other O
research O
group O
previously O
designated O
airSR O
as O
yhcSR O
and O
reported O
that O
it O
was O
an O
essential O
TCS O
[ O
20 O
]. O
However, O
there O
are O
reports O
of O
an O
airSR O
mutation O
in O
several O
strains O
including O
Newman O
[ O
22 O
], O
MW2 O
[ O
29 O
], O
a O
clinically O
isolated O
strain O
15981 O
[ O
9 O
], O
and O
NCTC8325, O
indicating O
that O
AirSR O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
essential O
in O
all O
strain O
backgrounds. O
Early O
research O
on O
airSR O
reported O
that O
this O
TCS O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
nitrate O
respiratory O
pathway O
[ O
21 O
] O
or O
in O
the O
direct O
regulation O
of O
the O
lac O
and O
opuCABCD O
operons O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Our O
microarray O
results O
indicated O
the O
down-regulation O
of O
the O
nar O
and O
nre O
operons O
in O
the O
airSR O
mutant, O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
report O
that O
airSR O
can O
positively O
regulate O
the O
nitrate O
respiratory O
pathway O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Our O
microarray O
data, O
however, O
did O
not O
show O
that O
airSR O
can O
regulate O

or O
opuC O

To O
decrease O
the O

may O
need O
to O
prepare O

liquids O
to O
facilitate O

Liquids O
are O
often O

It O
may O
be O

A O
gastrostomy O
tube O
(G-tube O
or O

is O
recommended O
when O
any O
of O
the O
following O
occur: O
a O

cannot O
eat O
enough O
to O
grow O
or O
a O
person O
of O
any O
age O
cannot O
eat O
enough O
to O

is O
problematic; O
mealtimes O
are O
stressful O
or O
too O
long, O
interfering O
with O
other O
activities O
[ O
161 O
]. O
Feeding O
tubes O
can O
decrease O
the O
risk O
of O
aspiration O
by O
enabling O
persons O
to O
avoid O
liquids O
or O
foods O
that O
are O
difficult O
to O
swallow. O
They O
also O
provide O
adequate O
calories O
without O
the O
stress O
and O
time O
commitment O
of O
prolonged O
meals. O
G-tubes O
do O
not O
prevent O
people O
from O
eating O
by O
mouth. O
People O
who O
undergo O
gastric O
tube O
placement O
should O
initially O
be O
re-fed O
very O
slowly O
to O
avoid O
aspiration O
due O
to O
gastroesophageal O
reflux. O
Once O
a O
tube O
is O
in O
place, O
the O
general O
goal O
should O
be O
to O
maintain O

at O
the O

Therefore, O
HIV, O

been O
widely O
used O
for O
the O

(Cunningham O

According O

in O
14 O

protozoan O
genera, O
such O
as O
Proteromonadida, O

Nonetheless, O
the O

many O
of O
these O

Conversely, O
some O

(Giardia, O
Hexamita, O

and O
trichomonadids O
(Monocercomonas, O

can O
cause O
weight O

enteritis O
in O
severely O

animals. O
The O
clinical O

In O

Lee O

( O

found O

Furthermore, O
this O

that O
the O

occurred O
rampantly O
in O

Then, O

the O

NSAIDs O
Several O
epidemiological O
studies O
suggested O
that O
NSAIDs O
may O
delay O
the O
onset O
of O
AD O
for O
up O
to O
five O
or O
more O
years, O
and O
are O
even O
able O
to O
prevent O
the O
onset O

AD O
in O
patients O
with O
mild O
cognitive O
impairment O
(MCI) O
or O
in O
healthy O
elderly O
subjects O
at O
risk O
of O
developing O
AD O
(Imbimbo O
et O
al., O
2010 O
). O
Thus, O
it O
could O
be O
hypothesized O
that O
the O
chronic O
use O
of O
NSAIDs O
may O
be O
beneficial O
only O
in O
the O
very O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
AD O
process O
in O
coincidence O
of O
initial O
Aβ O
deposition, O
microglia O
activation O
and O
consequent O
release O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
mediators. O
When O
the O
Aβ O
deposition O
process O
is O
already O
started, O
NSAIDs O
are O
no O
longer O
effective O
and O
may O
even O
be O
detrimental O
because O
of O
their O
inhibitory O
activity O
on O
chronically O
activated O
microglia O
that O
on O
long-term O
may O
mediate O
Aβ O
clearance O
(Imbimbo O
et O
al., O
2010 O
). O
In O
conclusion, O
these O
studies O
indicate O
that O
there O
is O
a O
dose-response O
relationship O
between O
NSAID O
use O
and O
the O
relative O
risk O
of O
AD, O
with O
longer O
periods O
of O
use O
related O
to O
reduce O
relative O
risks O
of O
AD. O
Based O
on O
these O
studies, O
the O
relative O
risk O
of O
AD O
appears O
to O
be O
25-50% O
lower O
in O
groups O
of O
individuals O
with O
long-term O
(2 O
years O
or O
more) O
NSAID O
use O
(in O
t’ O
Veld O
et O
al., O
2001 O
). O
The O
reduction O
in O
risk O
also O
appears O
to O
be O
restricted O
to O
AD; O
no O
protective O
effect O
against O
vascular O
dementia O
was O
noted. O
The O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
to O
the O
accumulating O
Aβ O
and O
tau O
deposits O
worsens O
the O
pathological O
process O
and O
that O
NSAIDs O
may O
alleviate O
the O

This O
result O
also O
supported O
the O
results O
of O

in O

Both O
active O
oxygen O
and O
reactive O
nitrogen O
in O

were O
the O
environmental O
pressures O
that O
the O

would O
encounter. O
The O

was O
crucial O
for O
the O
survival O
of O

So O
far, O
the O
rpoB O
mutant O
has O
not O
been O
characterized O
in O
detail O
and O
may O
lack O
sufficient O
attention. O
The O
lacking O

of O
rifampin O
in O
use O
and O
the O
residual O
drug O
in O
the O
environment O
may O
provide O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
with O
the O
stress O
condition O
required O
for O
spontaneous O
mutation. O
The O
fitness O
cost O
of O
rpoB O
mutation O
may O
be O
due O
to O
changes O
in O
gene O
transcription O
level, O
and O
transcriptome O
analysis O
of O
mutant O
strains O
will O
be O
of O
great O
value. O
Therefore, O
further O
investigation O
and O
evaluation O
are O
necessary. O
Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
R. O
anatipestifer O
rifampin O
resistance O
is O
mainly O
derived O
from O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
mutation, O
whose O
types O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
strain O
background O
and O
environment O
stress. O
The O
spontaneous O
mutation O
of O
rpoB O
gene O
is O
concentrated O
in O
the O
mutation O
type O
with O
low O
fitness O
cost. O
And O
different O
rpoB O
mutations O
confer O
different O
fitness O
costs. O
Our O

In O
the O

61% O
of O
the O
producers O
said O
that O
drought O
tolerance O
was O
a O
priority, O
with O
19% O
making O
it O
a O

Water O
is O
the O

in O
some O
of O
the O

in O
the O
Intermountain O

A O

For O
the O

These O
were O

However, O
these O

be O
a O

for O
livestock O

Additionally, O
our O

showed O
that O

may O
have O
therapeutic O

Thus, O
measuring O
the O

The O
three O

are: O
cerebral O

The O
role O
of O

in O

via O
the O
inflammation O
regulatION O
Inflammation O
is O
the O
body’s O
response O
to O
infections O
and O
tissue O
injury O
and O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
is O
orchestrated O
by O
the O
cells O
of O
the O
immune O
system; O
both O
from O
the O
“adaptive” O
branch O
(including O
T- O
and O
B-cells O
with O
the O
capacity O
to O
induce O
long-term O
memory O
of O
encountered O
pathogens, O
“immunisation”) O
and O
the O
“innate” O
branch O
(including O
monocytes, O
macrophages, O
dendritic O
cells, O
and O
mast O
cells, O
that O
are O
targeted O
against O
common O
pathogen O
antigens). O
Inflammation O
was O
first O
implicated O
in O
AD O
pathology O
and O
development O
in O
the O
1990s, O
with O
the O
neuropathological O
finding O
of O
activated O
inflammatory O
cells O
(microglia O
and O
astrocytes) O
and O
inflammatory O
proteins O
(e.g. O
cytokines O
and O

surrounding O
the O
amyloid O
plaques O
and O
the O
neurofibrillary O
tangles O
(Aisen O
and O
Davis, O
1994 O
). O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
epidemiological O
findings, O
patients O
suffering O
from O
arthritis O
and O
other O
patient O
groups O
with O
a O
high O
intake O
of O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
(NSAID) O
were O
observed O
to O
have O
had O
a O
lower O
proportion O
of O
individuals O
affected O
with O
AD. O
Many O
of O
the O
earliest O
results O
were O
at O
first O
dismissed O
as O
inaccurate O
given O
the O
perception O
of O
the O
brain O
as O
an O
“immune O
privileged” O
organ, O
i.e. O
an O
organ O
that O
does O
not O
elicit O
inflammation O
in O
response O
to O
antigens O
or O
damage. O
However, O
abundant O
literature O
can O
now O
be O
found O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
acute O
phase O
proteins O
in O
Aβ O
plaques, O
activated O
microglial O
cells O
that O
stain O
for O
inflammatory O
cytokines, O
and O
components O
of O

in O
brain O

of O

patients. O

In O
this O
model, O
the O
immunotherapeutic O
effect O
was O
not O
potent O
enough, O
while O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
delayed O
tumour O
growth O
and O
prolonged O
survival O
significantly. O
All O
animal O

macrophages, O
capable O
of O
ADCC O
and O

We O
observed O
a O
modest O
and O
temporary O
reduction O
in O
white O
blood O
cell O
counts O
after O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
treatment. O
Additionally, O
while O
some O
biochemical O
indication O
of O
hepatotoxicity O
was O
seen, O
no O
abnormal O
findings O
of O
the O
liver O
were O
observed O
by O
histopathological O
examination O
of O
organs. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
treatment O
related O
changes O
were O
mainly O
seen O
in O
the O
ovaries, O
consistent O
with O
pre-clinical O
studies O
with O
177 O
Lu-lilotomab O
satetraxetan O
[ O
33 O
]. O
No O
treatment O
related O
changes O
were O
identified O
in O
the O
bone O
marrow, O
possibly O
attributed O
to O
bone O
marrow O
regeneration O
due O
to O
the O
long O
study O
duration. O
In O
a O
phase O
1/2a O
clinical O
trial O
of O
177 O
Lu-lilotomab O
satetraxetan O
for O
treatment O
of O
patients O
with O
relapsed O
indolent O
NHL, O
reversible O
thrombocytopenia O
and O
neutropenia O
were O
the O
most O
common O
adverse O
events O
observed O
[ O
21 O
]. O
The O
favourable O
efficacy O
and O
toxicity O
profile O
of O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
suggests O
a O
beneficial O
therapeutic O
window. O
Moreover, O
this O
compound O
binds O
to O
a O
different O
antigen O
than O
CD20, O
which O
is O
the O
most O
common O
target O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
B O
cell O
malignancies. O
Accordingly, O
most O
NHL O
patients O
with O
recurrent O
disease O
will O
become O
refractory O
to O
treatments O
targeting O
CD20 O
[ O
12 O
]. O
By O
pursuing O
a O
different O
target, O
like O
CD37, O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
may O
overcome O
this O
resistance O
and O
become O
a O
valid O
option O
for O
patients O
with O
recurrent O
disease. O
Other O
novel O
treatments O
like O
BTK O
inhibitors O
and O
BCL2-inhibitors O
have O
offered O
effective O
treatment O
options, O
particularly O
for O
patients O
with O
CLL O
and O
MCL O
[ O
34 O
– O
40 O
]. O
However, O
most O
patients O
will O
eventually O
relapse O
again O
and O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
might O
then O
represent O
a O
tolerable O
and O
effective O
treatment O
option. O

Although O
this O
high O
diversity O
may O
look O
favourable, O
it O
might O
actually O
be O
a O
threat O
for O
locally O

Extremely O

might O
slow O

Alternatively, O
but O
not O
mutually O
exclusive, O
mating O
of O

may O
also O
increase O

Therefore, O
De O
La O
Rúa O
et O
al. O
( O
2013 O
) O
strongly O
call O
for O
strict O
conservation O
measures O
to O
preserve O
functional O
genetic O
diversity O
through O
conservation O
of O
local O
subspecies. O
This O
conservation O
will O
even O
work O
at O
a O
smaller O
(more O
local) O
scale O
if O
our O
proposed O
approach O
will O
conserve O
locally O
adapted O
populations O
of O
bee O
colonies. O
This O
will O
overall O
increase O
the O
functional O
genetic O
diversity O
of O
the O
honey O
bee, O
at O
country- O
and O
continent O
level O
(which O
is O
the O
sum O
of O
local O
diversities, O
in O
contrast O
to O
an O
artificially O
maintained O
diversity O
by O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
breeders). O
DBBB O
may O
help O
swarms O
to O
establish, O
thereby O
contributing O
to O
re-introduction O
of O
honey O
bees O
into O
the O
wild O
A O
significant O
proportion O
of O
western O
honey O
bee, O
A. O
mellifera O
populations O
has O
always O
been O
non-managed O
(Africa; O
Jaffé O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
On O
feral O
colonies O
strong O
selection O
pressures O
act, O
not O
only O
by O
V. O
destructor. O
Being O
feral O
may, O
however, O
also O
reduce O
certain O
selection O
pressures O
in O
comparison O
to O
being O
managed O
(Loftus O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
In O
cases O
where O
the O
feral O
population O
is O
sufficiently O
isolated O
from O
managed O
colonies, O
this O
can O
lead O
to O
resistance O
(e.g. O
Seeley O
2007 O
; O
Le O
Conte O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
Often O
swarms O
from O
managed O
colonies, O
which O
become O
feral, O
soon O
die O
(Thompson O
et O
al. O
2014 O
), O
probably O
because O
those O
colonies O
do O
not O
possess O
genes O
enabling O
survival O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
mite O
treatments. O
However, O
swarms O
from O
the O
naturally O
selected O
population O
will O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
survive O
because O
they O
have O
acquired O
resilience O
to O
V. O
destructor. O
Darwin’s O
Black O
Bee O
Box O
might O
therefore O
shift O
the O
balance O
between O
managed O
and O
feral O
colonies O
by O
increasing O
the O
chances O
for O
survival O
and O
re-establishment O
of O
wild O
honey O
bee O
populations. O

In O

that O

A O

of O
this O

was O
that O

by O

This O

towards O
the O
dominant O

Culture-independent, O

frequently O
consist O
of O

. O
In O
this O
study, O
amplified O
ompA O

were O
not O
able O
to O
be O

due O
to O
poor O

New O
evidence O
has O
come O
to O
light O
concerning O
the O
different O
expressions O
of O
diabetes, O
as O
well O
as O
its O
connection O
to O
other O
diseases. O
It O
used O
to O
be O
supposed O
that O
there O
were O
two O
types O
of O
diabetes: O
type-1 O
and O
type-2. O
However, O
the O
idea O
that O
AD O
might O
be O
type-3 O
diabetes O
was O
proposed O
ten O
years O
ago O
(Martins O
et O
al., O
2006 O
). O
Some O
studies O
suggested O
that O
AD O
progresses O
because O
of O
the O
brain O
developing O
resistance O
to O
insulin, O
which O
in O
turn O
prevents O
proper O
lipid O
uptake. O
Over O
time, O
these O
lipids O
build O
up O
in O
the O
brain O
rather O
than O
properly O
absorb, O
which O
results O
in O
increased O
stress O
and O
inflammation, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
symptoms O
usually O
related O
with O
dementia O
(de O
la O
Monte, O
2014 O
; O
Rani O
et O
al., O
2016 O
). O
Given O
the O
evidence O
provided O
by O
animal O
models O
of O
the O
strong O
relationship O
between O
T2DM O
and O
AD. O
When O
the O
authors O
blocked O
the O
path O
of O
insulin O
to O
rats’ O
brains, O
their O
neurons O
deteriorated, O
they O
became O
physically O
confused O
and O
their O
brains O
showed O
all O
the O
signs O
of O
AD. O
Furthermore, O
the O
study O
provided O
proof O
that O
T2DM O
and O
AD O
aggravate O
each O
other O
and O
suggested O
several O
potential O
mechanisms O
underlying O
the O
two O
disorders, O
such O
as, O
Aβ O
clearance O
by O
insulin O
degradation O
enzyme O
(IDE), O
glucose O
metabolism, O
O-GlcNAcylation, O
Aβ O
aggregation O
by O
advanced O
glycation O
end O
products O
(AGEs), O
oxidative O
stress, O
circulating O
cortisol, O
and O
cerebral O
vascular O
insufficiency, O
as O
well O
as O
inflammation, O
and O
aging. O
In O
fact, O
people O
with O
diabetes O
have O
double O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
AD. O
This O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
everyone O
who O
has O
diabetes O
will O
eventually O
develop O
AD, O
or O
that O
all O
people O
with O
AD O
have O
diabetes. O

Dysphagia O
also O
can O

Some O

Because O

Background O
Caleosin/peroxygenases O
(designated O
PF05042 O
in O
Pfam, O
or O
IPR007736 O
in O
InterPro) O
are O
an O
unusual O
group O
of O
genes/proteins O
with O
anomalous O
distributions O
in O
eukaryotic O
taxa. O
Caleosin/peroxygenase O
(CLO/PXG)-like O
genes O
are O
found O
almost O
universally O
in O
land O
plants O
(Embryophyta) O
and O
green O
algae O
(Chlorophyta) O
and O
are O
also O
found O
widely O
in O
all O
fungal O
groups O
but O
are O
almost O
completely O
absent O
from O
other O
eukaryotic O
groups O
such O
as O
protozoans O
and O
animals O
[ O
1 O
– O
4 O
]. O
There O
are O
also O
numerous O
reports O
of O
the O
various O
physiological O
roles O
of O
the O

CLO/PXG O
proteins O
in O
several O
Ascomycete O
and O
Basidiomycete O
fungal O
species O
[ O
5 O
– O
11 O
]. O
The O
widespread O
distribution O
of O
CLO/PXG-like O
genes O
in O
just O
plant O
and O
fungal O
genomes O
is O
anomalous O
because O
the O
fungi O
are O
grouped O
with O
animals O
(Metazoa) O
as O
members O
of O
the O
monophyletic O
Opisthokont O
clade O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
contrast, O
land O
plants O
and O
green O
algae O
are O
grouped O
in O
a O
completely O
separate O
monophyletic O
eukaryotic O
lineage O
termed O
the O
Viridiplantae. O
If O
caleosins O
were O
present O
in O
the O
common O
ancestor O
of O
the O
Opisthokonts O
and O
Viridiplantae, O
the O
so-called O
‘last O
eukaryotic O

ancestor’ O
(LECA), O
then O
their O
presence O
would O
also O
be O
expected O
in O
at O
least O
some O
Metazoan O
genomes. O
That O
is O
unless O
these O
genes O
were O
lost O
prior O
to O
the O
earliest O
divergence O
of O
Metazoan O
groups, O
which O
probably O
occurred O
&gt; O
650 O
million O
years O
ago O
(Mya) O
[ O
13 O
– O

]. O
Given O
the O
strong O
support O
for O
Metazoan O
monophyly O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
, O
17 O
], O
the O
loss O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
early O
in O
protozoan O
evolution, O
i.e. O
before O
the O
appearance O
of O
metazoans, O
may O
be O
the O
most O
parsimonious O
explanation O
of O
the O
otherwise O
anomalous O
distribution O
of O
this O
gene O
family O
in O
eukaryotes. O

Among O
them O
are O
the O
two O
contiguous O
sRNAs O
STnc1740 O
and O
STnc2160 O
with O
a O

of O
180 O
and O
69 O
nucleotides, O
respectively O
(Fig. O

) O
29 O
, O

The O
sequences O
of O
both O
sRNAs O
are O
identical O
in O
the O
common O
laboratory O
strains O
LT-2, O
SL1344, O

are O

the O
genomic O
island O
GEI4417/4436 O
that O
harbors O
the O
genes O
that O
are O
required O
for O

Both O
sRNAs O
are O
therefore O
proposed O
to O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
this O
metabolic O

When O
measured O
under O
22 O

growth O
conditions, O
STnc2160 O
was O
only O
strongly O
upregulated O

anaerobic O
shock, O
whereas O
STnc1740 O
was O
expressed O
under O
most O
of O
the O
growth O
conditions O

. O
STnc2160 O
is O
located O
in O
the O
3′-untranslated O
region O
(3′-UTR) O
of O
iolB O
and O
partially O
overlaps O

in O
the O

Comparing O
across O

the O
T O

shows O
an O
overall O
higher O
metabolic O

(Fig. O

). O
Specifically, O
in O
comparison O
with O
the O
glycolytically O

EM O
subset, O
the O
T O
CM O
population O
was O
characterized O

this O

a O

In O
conclusion, O
the O
expansion O

demonstrated O
the O
ability O
to O
attribute O
differential O

to O
divergent O
metabolic O
states O
of O

To O
our O
knowledge, O
we O
identified O
a O
novel O
metabolic O
profile O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
T O

, O
which O
produces O
high O

Discussion O
The O
ability O
to O
measure O
the O
metabolic O
state O
of O
specific O
immune O
cells O
is O
essential O
for O
a O
fundamental O
understanding O
of O
cellular O
function. O
Here, O
we O
present O
Met-Flow, O
a O
capability O
to O
simultaneously O
measure O
multiple O
metabolic O
pathways O
across O
diverse O
immune O
subsets O
on O
a O
single-cell, O
protein O
level O
using O
a O
combination O
of O
intracellular O
staining O
and O
flow O
cytometry. O
This O
technology O
measures O
the O
metabolic O
capacity O
of O
a O
cell O
by O
protein O
levels O
of O
rate-limiting O
and O
critical O
enzymes, O
which O
govern O
pathways. O
A O
higher O
capacity O
indicates O
increased O
potential O
to O
engage O
a O
metabolic O
pathway. O
This O
defines O
cellular O
plasticity, O
the O
ability O
to O
respond O
to O
metabolic O
demands, O
including O
changes O
in O
redox O
environments O
or O
nutrient O
availability. O
Therefore, O
capacity O
translates O
into O
cellular O
flexibility, O
linking O
metabolic O
phenotype O
to O
function. O
Met-Flow O
does O
not O
directly O
measure O
flux O
of O
a O
pathway, O
which O
can O
be O
investigated O
by O
real-time O
respiration O
or O
metabolite O
measurements. O
Our O
application O
of O
Met-Flow O
on O
human O
PBMCs O
revealed O
cell-specific O
differences O
in O
core O
metabolic O
pathways. O

Taken O
together, O
our O
data O
indicate O
that O
dendritic O
cells O
display O
reduced O
ability O
to O
process O
a O
soluble O
antigen O
during O
later O
stages O
of O
infection O
with O
ECTV. O
The O
reduction O
of O

than O
GM-BM O

(at O

hpi: O
2.9-fold O
and O

respectively). O
Basing O
on O
these O
findings, O
we O
cannot O
unequivocally O
state O
that O
the O
enhanced O

effect O
on O
DQ-OVA O

observed O
in O
both O

at O

it O

Commercial O

does O
not O

approach, O
because O
the O

the O

However, O
beekeepers O
using O
our O
approach O
could O
additionally O

(in O

add O
those O

(e.g. O

There O
is O
a O
potential O
for O
a O
considerable O

bottleneck O
if O
very O
few O
colonies O
survive O
from O
the O
initial O
cohort. O
However, O
we O
do O
not O
advise O
total O
isolation. O
Therefore, O
some O
foreign O
genes O
are O
likely O
to O
enter O
the O
population. O
If O
inbreeding O
will O
nevertheless O
occur, O
adding O

might O
be O
considered O
to O
maintain O
genetic O

There O
are O

not O
a O

It O
is O
therefore O
apparent O
that O
the O

is O
very O
unlikely O
to O
reach O
exactly O
the O

the O

one. O
Nevertheless, O

strongly O
suggest O
that O
the O
actual O
level O
of O
tolerance O
which O
can O
be O
reached O
by O
A. O

is O
apparently O
sufficient O

However, O
this O

(P-Etx), O
with O
an O

a O

Despite O
the O

some O

could O
penetrate O

( O

however, O
the O

the O

could O
not O
cause O

( O

which O
indicated O
that O
the O

was O
not O
the O

for O
the O

In O

cells, O
ROS O

was O
found O
to O

( O

Even O

it O

observed O
that O

( O

although O
the O

However, O
by O
exogenously O

the O

were O
obviously O
eliminated O
and O
the O

was O
accelerated O
( O

). O
The O
penetration O
rate O
was O
not O
improved O
by O
GSH, O
however O
( O
Fig. O

). O
Combined O
with O
the O

we O
concluded O
that O
the O
pathogenicty O
defect O
of O
the O
ETF O

mainly O
resulted O
from O
two O
defects: O
one O
is O
from O
the O
low O

which O
caused O
the O
low O

rate; O
another O
is O
from O
not O
overcoming O
the O

which O
led O

In O

In O
line O
with O
this, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
A. O
flavus O
AfPXG O
has O
peroxygenase O
activity O
and O
mediates O
fungal O
development O
and O
aflatoxin O
production O
[ O

]. O
A O
more O
recent O
report O
has O
shown O
that O
the O
AfPXG-deficient O
line O
resulted O
in O
a O
fungal O
phenotype O
characterized O
with O
a O
severe O
decrease O
in O
mycelium O
growth, O
failure O
in O
sporulation O
and O
a O
reduced O
level O
of O
aflatoxin. O
Inversely, O
the O
line O
that O
overexpressed O
AfPXG, O
with O
the O
reporter O
gene O
Gfp O
exhibited O
an O
elevated O
numbers O
of O
stable O
lipid O

(LDs) O
plus O
enhanced O
aflatoxin O
levels O
[ O

]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
transcriptomic O
profile O
of O
Blumeria O
graminis O
f. O
sp. O
tritici O
showed O
that O
a O
Ca O

is O

in O
fungal O
conidiation O
[ O

]. O
Also, O
a O
similar O
situation O
was O
observed O
in O
Metarhizium O
robertsii O
[ O

]. O
In O
addition O
to O
their O
developmental O
impacts, O
CLO/PXGs O
can O
act O
as O
cellular O
protective O
agents O
against O
toxins O
and O
highly O
hydrophobic O
contaminants O
via O
their O
roles O
in O
stabilizing O
the O
structure O
of O
toxin-sequestrating O
LDs O
[ O
41 O
, O
102 O
, O
103 O
]. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
observed O
that O
plant O
CLOs/PXGs O
affect O
development O
and O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
fungal O
pathogens O
via O
the O
anti-fungal O
compounds O
generated O
by O
lipid-metabolizing O
activities O
[ O

104 O
] O
. O
CLO/PXGs O
have O
also O
been O
implicated O
in O
fungal O
pathogenicity O
in O
insect O
hosts. O
In O
the O
entomopathogenic O
species, O
Beauveria O
(Cordyceps) O
bassiana, O
caleosins O
are O
involved O
in O
several O
aspects O
of O
both O
reproduction O
and O
pathogenesis. O
This O
was O
based O
on O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
single O
LD-surface O
caleosin-like O
protein O
with O
roles O
in O
lipid O
storage O
and O
fungal O
infection O
[ O

There O
is O
a O
potential O
for O
a O
considerable O
genetic O
bottleneck O
if O
very O
few O
colonies O
survive O
from O
the O
initial O
cohort. O
However, O
we O
do O
not O
advise O
total O
isolation. O
Therefore, O
some O
foreign O
genes O
are O
likely O
to O
enter O
the O
population. O
If O
inbreeding O
will O
nevertheless O
occur, O
adding O
colonies O
might O
be O
considered O
to O
maintain O
genetic O

There O
are O

with O
respect O
to O

For O

successful O

not O
a O

It O
is O
therefore O

that O
the O

very O

to O
reach O
exactly O
the O

Introduction O
Enthomopathogenic O
bacteria O
are O
widespread O
in O
nature O
and O
include O
mainly O
members O
of O
the O
genera O
Bacillus, O
Peanibacillus, O
Brevibacillus, O
Serratia, O
Pseudomonas, O
Xenorhabdus, O
and O
Photorhabdus. O
As O
obligate O
or O
facultative O
insect O
pathogens, O
entomopathogenic O
bacteria O
display O
different O
host O
ranges O
and O
mechanisms O
of O
infection; O
however, O
all O
of O
them O
have O
similar O
abilities O
to O
produce O
a O
huge O
repertoire O
of O
virulence O
factors O
to O
overcome O
insect O
immune O
responses O
and O
host O
microbiota O
(Boemare O
and O

2009 O
; O
Glare O
et O

). O
Photorhabdus O
and O
Xenorhabdus O
bacteria O
exhibit O
another O
essential O
feature: O
as O
obligate O
symbionts O
of O
infective O
juveniles O
(IJs) O
of O
entomopathogenic O
nematodes O
(EPNs) O
from O
the O
genera O
Steinernema O
and O
Heterorhabditis, O
respectively, O
they O
spend O
some O
part O
of O
their O
lives O
inside O
nematodes O
using O
them O
as O
a O
vector O
for O
efficient O
infection O
of O
insects O
(Goodrich-Blair O
and O

2007 O
; O

Nematodes O
from O
the O
genus O
Sternainema O
carry O
symbiotic O
bacteria O
in O
a O
specialized O
vesicle O
called O
the O
receptacle, O
which O
is O
placed O
in O
the O
anterior O
part O
of O
the O

In O
turn, O
Heterorhabditis O
nematodes, O
which O
do O
not O
have O
such O
a O
specialized O
structure, O
use O
their O
intestinal O

to O
harbor O
bacteria O

(Bird O
and O

; O

). O
The O
life O
cycle O
of O
all O
EPN O
microsymbionts O
is O
similar O
and O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
three O
phases: O
phoretic O
in O
the O
nematode O
host, O
pathogenic O
in O
the O
insect O
body, O
and O
saprophytic O
in O
the O

(Ciche O

We O
found O
here O
that O
an O

to O

[ O

we O
speculate O
that O
Pelnac O
indirectly O
promotes O
basement O
membrane O
reconstruction O
by O
providing O
a O
scaffold O
for O
keratinocyte O
and O
fibroblast O

Indeed, O
dermal O

staining O
of O
wound O

on O
days O
21 O

showed O
that O
the O

was O
thicker O
and O
more O
ordered O
in O
the O
Pelnac O
as O
compared O
to O
the O
Vaseline O
gauze O
group. O
Pelnac O
also O
modulated O
the O
synthesis O
of O
collagen O
in O
the O
wound, O
thereby O
preventing O
excessive O
collagen O
deposition O
and O
hyperplasia. O
Full-thickness O
wounds O
close O
through O
re-epithelialization O
and O
contraction O
induced O
by O
α-SMA-positive O

in O
granulation O
tissue; O
however, O
the O
persistence O
and O
activation O
of O
myofibroblasts O
during O
tissue O
regeneration O
lead O
to O
fibrotic O

[ O
29 O
– O
35 O
]. O
We O
observed O
that O
Pelnac O
suppressed O
α-SMA O
expression O
in O
the O
dermis; O
it O
may O
thus O
enhance O
ECM O

and O
accelerate O
wound O

of O

by O
inducing O

myofibroblasts. O
According O
to O
the O
healing O
process O
following O
minced O

graft O
transplantation, O
we O
believe O
that O
Pelnac, O
as O
an O
overlay O
for O
minced O
split-thickness O
skin O
graft, O
still O
can O
complete O
the O
vascularization O
process O
and O
play O
its O
role O
as O
a O
dermal O
scaffold O
perfectly, O
and O
it O
does O
not O
affect O
the O
movement O
of O
minced O
split-thickness O
skin O

from O
the O
wound O
base O
to O
the O

surface; O
moreover, O
the O
minced O
split-thickness O
skin O
graft O
participates O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
the O

However, O
as O

several O

The O
distribution O

often O
depends O
on O
distribution O

such O
insight O

is O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O

[ O

and O
it O
also O
causes O

Tick-borne O
fever, O
caused O
by O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
is O
considered O
a O
major O
problem O
for O

production. O
Anaplasmosis O
leads O

[ O

Infection O
with O
A. O

Some O
tick-borne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Borrelia O
burgdorferi O
(sensu O
lato) O
and O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
have O
a O
high O
genetic O
diversity. O
Due O
to O
the O
high O
genetic O
diversity, O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
was O
formerly O
even O
split O
in O
three O
different O
species O
[ O
12 O
]. O
This O
genetic O

has O
probably O
arisen O
as O
a O
response O
to O

of O

Elucidating O

Sexual O
transmission O
of O
HCV O
is O
still O
controversially O
discussed, O
but O
considered O
possible O
[ O
47 O
]. O
Sexual O
transmission O
of O
HCV O
has O
been O
more O
commonly O
recorded O
in O
men-who-have-sex-with-men O
featuring O
high O
sexual O
(e.g., O
HIV) O
and O
drug O

risks O
status O
[ O
48 O
]. O
Other O
studies O
have O
indicated O
the O
possibility O
of O
sexual O
transmission O
of O
HCV O
among O
PWUIDs O
with O
sexually O
transmitted O
infections O
(STIs), O
especially O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
oral O
and/or O
genital O
wounds O
[ O
49 O
, O
50 O
]. O
High O
levels O
of O
syphilis O
and O
HCV-HIV O
co-infection O
among O
PWUIDs O
have O
been O
documented O
previously O
in O
the O
Amazon O
region O
[ O
17 O
, O
24 O
, O
29 O
, O
51 O
]. O
These O
dynamics O
likely O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
associations O
of O
unprotected O
sexual O
intercourse O
with O
HCV O
infection O
status O
in O
the O
present O
study O
sample. O
An O

such O
as O
HBV, O
HIV, O

confounded O
by O

the O

region O

will O
be O
carried O
out O
separately O
to O
further O
examine O
this O
comprehensive O
epidemiological-virological O
picture. O
The O
present O
study O
has O
a O
number O
of O
possible O
limitations. O
One O
limiting O
factor O
was O
the O
age O
limit O
criterion O
(18 O
years) O
applied O
for O
eligible O
participants, O
since O
many O
PWUIDs O
report O
an O
onset O
of O
illicit O
drug O
use O
at O
ages O
&lt; O
18 O
years. O
Second, O
the O
restriction O
of O
the O
study O
to O
the O
municipalities O
of O
the O
Amazon O
region O
renders O
the O
study O
sample O
not O
necessarily O
representative O
of O
the O
PWUIDs O
population O
in O
Northern O
Brazil O
more O
generally. O
In O
addition, O
although O
snowball O
sampling O
has O
been O
found O
to O
be O
adequate O
for O
quasi-representative O
sampling O
in O
hidden O
populations, O
could O
have O
been O
used O
to O
improve O
representativeness. O
As O
the O
interview O
data O
are O
self-reported, O
some O
information, O
such O
as O
drug O
use O
or O
sex-related O
risks O
behaviors, O
may O
contain O
response O
or O
recall O
bias. O
Screening O
for O
HCV O
infection O
was O
based O
on O
EIA, O
recent O
infections O
may O
present O
a O
small O
concentration O
of O
anti-HCV O
antibodies, O
not O
yet O
detected O
by O
EIA, O
and O
therefore O
may O
have O
been O
diagnosed O
as O
negative. O
Finally, O
the O
cross-sectional O
design O
of O
the O
study O
limits O
its O
capacity O
to O
establish O
causality. O

An O
abdominal O
CT O
showed O
intestinal O
edema O
and O
ascites O
on O
the O
liver O
and O
Douglas’s O
fossa O
(Fig. O
2 O
). O
Her O
limbs O
were O
cold, O
and O
both O
forearms O
were O
swollen O
because O
of O
the O
leakage O
of O
the O
peripheral O
infusion. O
Furthermore, O
she O
had O
respiratory O
distress. O
Septic O
shock O
was O
suspected, O
and O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
fluid O
resuscitation, O
empirical O
antibiotics O
(meropenem, O
linezolid, O
and O
micafungin), O
and O
a O
vasopressor. O
On O
ICU O
day O
2, O
her O
arms O
became O
swollen O
and O
red O
(Fig. O
3 O
). O
CT O
of O
the O
upper O
limbs O
showed O
edema O
between O
the O
muscles, O
suggesting O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
(Fig. O
4 O
). O
Therefore, O
emergency O
skin O
incision O
and O
debridement O
were O
performed. O
A O
pathological O
examination O
showed O
intense O
polymorphonuclear O
cell O
infiltration O
with O
diffuse O
connective O
tissue O
necrosis, O
compatible O
with O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
necrotizing O
fasciitis. O
Renal O
replacement O
therapy O
was O
also O
initiated O
because O
of O
acute O
kidney O
injury. O
Serum O
creatinine O
had O
increased O
from O
0.72 O
to O
3.03 O
mg/dL O
(stage O
3 O
based O
on O
the O
KDIGO O
classification). O
Surprisingly, O
S. O
pyogenes O
was O
detected O
from O
cultures O
of O
ascitic O
fluid, O
which O
were O
taken O
before O
sepsis O
developed, O
from O
blood O
and O
skin. O
The O
empirical O
antibiotics O
were O
switched O
to O
penicillin O
G, O
linezolid, O
and O
clindamycin O
(linezolid O
was O
discontinued O
on O
ICU O
day O
8). O
On O
ICU O
day O
3, O
1420 O
mL O
of O
ascites O
was O
drained O
and O
the O
patient O
underwent O
second O
debridement O
of O
the O
upper O
limbs, O
because O
the O
inflammation O
had O
extended O
over O
the O
shoulders. O
Her O
condition O
improved, O
and O
she O
overcame O
the O
septic O
shock O
on O
ICU O
day O
6. O
On O
ICU O
day O
9, O
Pseudomonas O
aeruginosa O
and O
Candida O
parapsilosis O
were O
found O
in O
a O
skin O
culture. O
Therefore, O
the O
antibiotics O
were O
switched O
to O
ciprofloxacin O
and O
micafungin. O

Current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
switch O
of O
these O
bacteria O
from O
nematodes O
to O
humans O
was O
facilitated O
by O
virulence O
genes O
(necessary O

acquired O
by O
horizontal O
transfer O
from O
other O
human O
pathogens O
(Hapeshi O
and O

). O
Unlike O

of O
the O

Photorhabdus, O
P. B-PATH

Despite O
the O
considerable O
effort, O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
transmission O
of O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
to O
the O
human O
body O
are O
still O
unclear. O
The O
most O
probable O
scenario O
is O
that O
the O
nematode O
vector O
may O
penetrate O
the O
human O

and O
transmit O
microsymbionts, O
thereby O
causing O

Conclusion O
The O
symbiotic O
bacteria O
of O
entomopathogenic O
nematodes O
emerged O
as O
a O
relevant O
model O
to O
study O
microorganism-host O
interactions. O
Although O
much O
interest O
in O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
has O
been O
historically O
driven O
by O
their O
symbiotic O
associations O
with O
nematodes, O
it O
is O
now O
clear O
that O
the O
uncovered O
richness O
of O
their O
secondary O
metabolites O
will O
accelerate O
investigations O
of O
these O
bacilli. O
Based O
on O
the O
recent O
advances O
in O
molecular O
phylogeny O
associated O
with O
the O
increasing O
number O
of O
available O
genes O
and O
genome O
sequences, O
the O
taxonomy O
of O
the O
symbiotic O
bacteria O
of O
entomopathogenic O
nematodes O
has O
been O
reassessed, O
with O
elevation O
of O
many O
subspecies O
to O
the O
species O
level O
and O
creation O
of O
new O
taxa. O
However, O
the O
current O
knowledge O
of O
the O
diversity, O
genealogy, O
and O
specificity O
of O
symbiotic O
relationships O
of O
Photorhabdus O
and O
Xenorhabdus O
bacteria O
with O
nematodes O
remains O
limited. O
In O
fact, O
despite O
the O
gradual O
identification O
of O
new O
EPN O
microsymbionts, O
mutualists O
of O
many O
existing O
nematode O
species O
have O
not O
been O
described O
yet. O
Therefore, O
substantial O
efforts O
should O
be O
made O
to O
improve O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
distribution O
of O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
species O
linked O
to O
the O
host O
and O
geographic O
origin. O

Here, O
we O
present O
Met-Flow, O
a O
capability O
to O
simultaneously O
measure O
multiple O
metabolic O
pathways O
across O
diverse O
immune O
subsets O
on O
a O
single-cell, O
protein O
level O
using O
a O
combination O
of O
intracellular O
staining O
and O
flow O
cytometry. O
This O
technology O
measures O
the O
metabolic O
capacity O
of O
a O
cell O
by O
protein O
levels O
of O
rate-limiting O
and O
critical O
enzymes, O
which O
govern O
pathways. O
A O
higher O
capacity O
indicates O
increased O
potential O
to O
engage O
a O
metabolic O
pathway. O
This O
defines O
cellular O
plasticity, O
the O
ability O
to O
respond O
to O
metabolic O
demands, O
including O
changes O
in O
redox O
environments O
or O
nutrient O
availability. O
Therefore, O
capacity O
translates O
into O
cellular O
flexibility, O
linking O
metabolic O
phenotype O
to O
function. O
Met-Flow O
does O
not O
directly O
measure O
flux O
of O
a O
pathway, O
which O
can O
be O
investigated O
by O
real-time O
respiration O
or O
metabolite O
measurements. O
Our O
application O
of O
Met-Flow O
on O
human O
PBMCs O
revealed O
cell-specific O
differences O
in O
core O
metabolic O
pathways. O
Furthermore, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
surface O
expression O
of O
specific O
activation O
molecules, O
cytokines, O
and O
chemokines O
were O
dependent O
on O
their O
underlying O
metabolic O
state O
in O
a O
cell O
type-specific O
manner. O
Together, O
this O
technique O
demonstrates O
that O
immune O
cell O
subsets O
have O
unique O
metabolic O
protein O
signatures O
relating O
directly O
to O
activation O
and O
maturation O
states. O
Bulk O
cellular O
analysis O
demonstrated O
that O
leukocytes O
possess O
an O
array O
of O
metabolic O
states O
leading O
to O
different O
functional O
capacity O
and O
disease O
outcome O
40 O
, O
48 O
. O
Moreover, O
the O
metabolic O
microenvironment O
and O
tissue O
localization O
influence O
immune O
cell O
function O
49 O
– O
51 O
. O
We O
analyzed O
PBMCs O
using O
Met-Flow, O
enabling O
a O
global O
view O
of O
immune O
cell O
metabolism. O
Analysis O
of O
monocytes, O
key O
innate O
immune O
cells, O
revealed O
higher O
expression O
of O
all O
metabolic O
proteins O
relative O
to O
other O
cell O
types. O
This O
suggests O
that O
they O
exist O

Discussion O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
exposure O
of O
weanling O
mice O
to O
RSV O
followed O
by O
Ova O
does O
not O
lead O
to O
(AHR) O
or O
pulmonary O
pathologies O
greater O
than O
that O
induced O
by O
Ova O
sensitization O
and O
challenge O
alone. O
In O
contrast, O
exposure O
of O
weanling O
mice O
to O
Ova O
followed O
by O
RSV O
infection O
leads O
to O
long-term O
pulmonary O
consequences O
at O
the O
pathophysiological O
level. O
RSV O
infection O
of O
weanling O
mice O
(unless O
accompanied O
by O
Ova O
sensitization O
and O
challenge) O
was O
unable O
to O
induce O
significant O
histopathologies O
or O
AHR. O
However, O
early O
sensitization O
and O
challenge O
with O
Ova O
followed O
by O
infection O
with O
RSV O
induced O
a O
2.6 O
fold O
increase O
in O
AHR O
over O
SAL O
controls O
and O
a O
2 O
fold O
increase O
over O
Ova O
alone O
(Figure O
2A O
). O
The O
enhanced O
AHR O
coincided O
with O
increased: O
1) O
total O
BAL O
cellularity O
(increases O
were O
specifically O
observed O
in O
eosinophil O
and O
lymphocyte O
cell O
numbers); O
2) O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
in O
both O
the O
perivascular O
and O
peribronchial O
regions O
of O
the O
lungs; O
3) O
mucus O
cell O
hypertrophy O
and O
airway O
mucus O
production; O
4) O
elevated O
levels O
of O
TNF-α, O
IFN-γ, O
IL-5, O
and O
IL-2 O
and O
airway O
collagen O
deposition; O
and O
5) O
subepithelial O
fibrosis. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
pulmonary O
remodeling O
events O
are O
occurring O
in O
weanling O
mice O
exposed O
to O
allergen O
followed O
by O
RSV O
infections O
and, O
furthermore, O
that O
these O
exposures O
synergistically O
enhance O
pulmonary O
pathology O
and O
physiology. O
In O
fact, O
preliminary O
data O
suggest O
that O
AHR O
is O
prolonged O
only O
in O
the O
OOR O
group O
(&gt; O
4 O
weeks O
post O
infection), O
whereas O
AHR O
in O
the O
OVA O
and O
ROO O
groups O
was O
no O
longer O
significantly O
different O
from O
SAL O
controls O
forty-eight O
hours O
after O
the O
last O
allergen O
challenge. O
Rarely, O
in O
humans O
or O
mice, O
is O
eosinophilia O
associated O
with O
primary O
RSV O
infection. O

of O
“100 O

are O
the O

[ O

]. O
The O
recent O
high O
frequency O
of O

has O
emphasized O
the O
need O
to O
enhance O
the O
biological O
security O
of O
the O
Zhejiang O
Province, O
located O
in O
the O
southeastern O

The O

has O
rapidly O
increased O
since O
2004, O
including O
the O

Furthermore, O
three O

Thus, O
an O

Despite O

there O

an O

Moreover, O
two O
identical O
strains O
in O
two O
disparate O
communities O
may O
contribute O
differently O
to O
their O
collective O
consortium O
and O
thus O
function O
differently O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
host. O
As O
such, O
tremendous O
care O
will O
need O
to O
be O
taken O
when O
assigning O
specific O
functional O
attributes O
to O
given O
commensal O
bacteria. O
Furthermore, O
a O
large O
majority O
of O
focus O
on O
cancer O

and O
the O
microbiome O
has O
investigated O
the O
contribution O
of O
bacteria O
but O
has O
yet O
to O
thoroughly O
investigate O
non-bacterial O
components O
including O
viruses, O
fungi O
and O
protozoa. O
Evidence O
in O
non-cancer O
disease O
models O
has O
indicated O
that O
the O
mycobiome O
(fungi) O
and O
the O
virome O
(viruses) O
can O
regulate O
systemic O
immunity. O
For O
example, O
manipulation O
of O
the O
mycobiome O
by O
oral O
antifungal O
drugs O
increased O
the O
severity O
of O
allergic O
airway O
disease O
in O
mice O
and O
was O
dependent O
on O
gut-resident O
CX3CR1 O
+ O
mononuclear O

[ O
127 O
, O
128 O
]. O
The O
virome, O
encompassing O
bacteriophages, O
mammalian O
viruses, O
and O
the O
endogenous O
retroviruses, O
is O
estimated O
to O
contain O
ten-fold O
more O
particles O
than O
bacterial O
microbes O
[ O
129 O
]. O
Supporting O
the O
link O
between O
the O
intestinal O
virome O
and O
host O
immunity, O
alterations O
in O
viral O
communities O
have O
been O
observed O
in O
the O
context O
of O
human O

[ O

and O

[ O

and O
have O
been O
associated O
with O
autoimmune O

including O
Type O

[ O

Incorporating O
a O
pan-kingdom O
view O
of O
the O
microbiome O
will O
likely O
lead O
to O
a O
more O
holistic O
understanding O
its O
impact O
on O
cancer O
treatment. O
Looking O
forward, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
recognize O
that O
the O
microbiome O
contributes O
only O
one O
dimension O
to O
the O
many O
facets O
that O
govern O
the O
interface O
between O
cancer O
and O
the O
host O
immune O
response. O
Cancer O
cells O
grow O
and O
evolve O
under O
the O
selective O
pressure O
of O
therapy, O
and O
molecular O
evolution O
of O
the O
tumor O
could O
still O
occur O
when O
the O
microbiome O
is O
manipulated O
to O
maximize O
immunotherapy O
efficacy. O
In O
addition, O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
microbiome O
similarly O
may O
evolve O
over O
the O
course O
of O
cancer O
progression O
and O
therapy O
administration. O

It O
must O

be O
emphasized O
that O
these O

This O
confirmed O
that O
T-cell O

remodeling O

the O
metabolic O
state O
that O
is O
specific O
to O
functional O
T-cell O

31 O
. O
Together, O
Met-Flow O
confirmed O
previously O

metabolic O
inductions O

glycolysis, O
OXPHOS O
and O
fatty-acid O
synthesis O
in O

This O
technique O
enabled O

immune O
activation O
on O
a O
single-cell O
level, O
by O
elucidating O
the O
positive O
correlation O
between O
GLUT1 O
and O

The O
data O
further O
demonstrated O
reprogramming O
of O
other O
pathways, O
including O
key O
enzymes O
in O
mitochondrial O
respiration, O
PPP, O
and O
fatty-acid O
oxidation, O
that O
contribute O
to O
the O
metabolic O
state O

Glycolytic O

alters O
T-cell O

Previous O
analysis O
of O
global O
metabolic O
reprograming O
showed O
an O
increased O
capacity O
for O
glucose O
uptake O
and O
glycolysis, O
associated O
with O
T-cell O
activation. O
Therefore, O
we O
investigated O
the O
dependence O
on O
glycolytic O
metabolism O
for O
the O
immuno-metabolic O
state. O
The O
glucose O
analog O
2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose O
(2-FDG) O
was O
added O
in O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
anti-CD3/28 O
stimulation O
in O
purified O
T O
cells. O
2-FDG O
is O
a O
closer O
analog O
to O
glucose O
than O
2-DG, O
is O
less O
toxic, O
more O
specific, O
and O
does O
not O
interfere O
with O
mannose O
metabolism O
by O
incorporating O
into O
N-linked O
glycosylation O
35 O
– O
38 O
. O
We O
determined O
that O
24 O
h O
of O
2-FDG O
alone O
did O
not O
cause O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
any O
metabolic O
pathways O
(Fig. O
3a–d O
). O
Anti-CD3/28 O
stimulation O
increased O
CD25 O
surface O
expression O
(Fig. O
2a O
), O
whereas O
addition O
of O
2-FDG O
prevented O
this O
increase O
(Fig. O
3c O
) O
39 O
. O
The O
dependence O
of O
glycolysis O
for O
CD25 O
expression O
was O
not O
shared O
across O
all O
surface O
activation O
molecules, O
as O
CD69 O
and O
HLA-DR O
were O
unchanged O
or O
increased, O
respectively O
(Fig. O

In O
several O
cases O
in O
plants O
it O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
CLO/PXG O
peroxygenase O
activity O
plays O
a O
direct O
role O
in O
plant O
responses O
to O
fungal O
pathogens. O
Examples O
include O
the O
response O
of O
wheat O
plants O
to O
infection O
by O
the O
pathogens, O
Puccinia O
graminis O
and O
P. O
stritiformis, O
where O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
host-pathogen O
co-expression O
network O
during O
infection O
of O
wheat O
plants O
[ O
10 O
, O
97 O
, O
98 O
]. O
Plant O
lipid O
droplets O
(LDs) O
are O
both O
one O
of O
the O
major O
subcellular O
sites O
of O
CLO/PXG O
accumulation O
and O
also O
contain O
oxylipins O
that O
are O
involved O
in O
anti-fungal O
defences O
[ O
31 O
, O
99 O
– O
101 O
]. O
In O
line O
with O
this, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
A. O
flavus O
AfPXG O
has O
peroxygenase O
activity O
and O
mediates O
fungal O
development O
and O
aflatoxin O
production O
[ O
82 O
]. O
A O
more O
recent O
report O
has O
shown O
that O
the O
AfPXG-deficient O
line O
resulted O
in O
a O
fungal O
phenotype O
characterized O
with O
a O
severe O
decrease O
in O
mycelium O
growth, O
failure O
in O
sporulation O
and O
a O
reduced O
level O
of O
aflatoxin. O
Inversely, O
the O
line O
that O
overexpressed O
AfPXG, O
with O
the O
reporter O
gene O
Gfp O
exhibited O
an O
elevated O
numbers O
of O
stable O
lipid O
droplets O
(LDs) O
plus O
enhanced O
aflatoxin O
levels O
[ O
3 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
transcriptomic O
profile O
of O
Blumeria O
graminis O
f. O
sp. O
tritici O
showed O
that O
a O
Ca O
+ O
2 O
-binding O
protein O
is O
involved O
in O
fungal O
conidiation O
[ O
9 O
]. O
Also, O
a O
similar O
situation O
was O
observed O
in O
Metarhizium O
robertsii O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
their O
developmental O
impacts, O
CLO/PXGs O
can O
act O
as O
cellular O
protective O
agents O
against O
toxins O
and O
highly O
hydrophobic O
contaminants O
via O
their O
roles O
in O
stabilizing O
the O
structure O
of O
toxin-sequestrating O
LDs O
[ O
41 O
, O
102 O
, O
103 O
]. O

However, O
by O
exogenously O
adding O
the O
reducing O
agent O
GSH, O
the O
unknown O
microbodies O
were O
obviously O
eliminated O
and O
the O
invasive O
growth O
of O
the O
mutant O
was O
accelerated O
( O
Fig. O
6d O
). O
The O
penetration O
rate O
was O
not O
improved O
by O
GSH, O
however O
( O
Fig. O
S7a O
). O
Combined O
with O
the O
appressoria O
turgor O
defect, O
we O
concluded O
that O
the O
pathogenicty O
defect O
of O
the O
ETF O
mutant O
etfb O
− O
mainly O
resulted O
from O
two O
defects: O
one O
is O
from O
the O
low O
turgor O
pressure O
which O
caused O
the O
low O
penetration O
rate; O
another O
is O
from O
not O
overcoming O
the O
host O
oxidative O
stress O
which O
led O
to O
restricted O
invasive O
growth. O
In O
summary, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
played O
a O
pleiotropic O
role O
in O
vegetative O
growth, O
conidiation O
and O
infection-related O
development O
of O
M. O

through O
its O
role O
in O
fatty O

for O
the O

the O

should O
further O

The O

these O

revealed O
that O
they O
might O

It O
is O
known O
that O
CML O

improved O
the O

Subsequently, O
another O

showed O
greater O

. O
OsCML4 O
could O

In O

some O

have O
reported O
that O
AtCML24 O
was O

that O

. O
AtCML37, O

roles O
in O

The O

showed O
that O
the O

The O

during O
the O

Moreover, O

Importantly, O
we O
show O
more O

with O
the O

These O

show O
that O

impair O
the O

This O
may O
serve O
as O
a O

Therefore, O
in O

to O
eliminate O
the O

in O
interpreting O

we O
first O
assessed O
the O

these O

during O
the O

Fig. O

shows O
that O
the O

did O
not O
change O
between O
ECTV-infected O

during O
the O

However, O
at O
24 O

the O

significantly O
(p O

higher O
in O
ECTV-infected O

In O
our O
recent O

[ O

we O
reported O
that O
GM-BM O
infected O
with O
ECTV O
at O
MOI O

5 O
did O
not O
show O
increased O
apoptosis O
until O

therefore, O
in O
the O
present O
study O
(GM-BM O
infected O
with O
ECTV O
at O

0.5) O
we O
evaluated O
the O
apoptotic O
rate O
only O
at O
24 O

(Fig. O

We O
demonstrate O
that O
in O
a O

showed O
a O
weaker O

than O

as O
similarly O
observed O
previously O
in O

indicating O
that O
Hfq O
controls O
the O

However, O
such O
a O

was O
not O
observed O
with O
a O

, O
a O
distinction O
that O
might O
be O
strain-specific O
or O
due O
to O
the O

More O
intriguingly, O
a O
lack O

Hfq O
resulted O
in O
a O
severe O
growth O

of O
S. O
Typhimurium O
in O

we O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
overall O
reduced O
transcription O
of O
most O

in O
the O

contributes O
to O
this O

although O
pleiotropic O

cannot O
be O
excluded. O
Similar O
to O
a O

a O

Hfq O
reduces O
the O

that O

Lower O

thus O
shortening O

pointing O
to O
a O

unknown, O
additional O

that O
fine-regulates O
the O

The O

and O
the O
reduction O
of O
the O

by O
the O

indicate O
that O
Hfq O

In O

a O

However, O
the O

Background O
Despite O

the O

remains O
a O

threat. O
Nearly O
half O
of O
the O

is O
at O
risk O
and O
the O
disease O
kills O
more O
than O
400 O
thousand O
people O
a O

[ O

Anopheles O
gambiae O
(s.l.) O
is O
the O
main O
malaria O
vector O
in O
sub-Saharan O
Africa, O
the O
region O
with O
the O
highest O
mortality O
rates, O
due O
to O
the O
combination O
of O
this O
mosquito’s O
high O
anthropophily O
and O
its O
susceptibility O
to O
Plasmodium B-PATH
falciparum I-PATH
infection O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
Only O
female O
mosquitoes O
transmit O
the O
disease, O
as O
they O
ingest O
the O
blood O
meal O
that O
is O
necessary O
for O
the O
completion O
of O
their O
reproductive O
cycle O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Thus, O
female O
sex O
dimorphisms O
in O
An. O
gambiae O
include O
sex-specific O
morphological O
and O
physiological O
adaptations O
for O
host-seeking, O
blood-feeding O
and O
digestion O
[ O
6 O
]. O
Mosquito O
control O
to O
prevent O
malaria O
transmission O
is O
currently O
being O
undermined O
by O
the O
rapid O
spread O
of O
resistance O
to O
common O

classes O
[ O
7 O
– O

Alternative O
tools O

innovative O
strategies O
are O
needed O
to O
improve O

which O
rely O
on O

The O
sterile O
insect O
technique O
(SIT) O
is O
a O
system O
based O
on O
the O
mass O
rearing O
and O
release O
of O
adult O
males O
sterilized O
using O
gamma O
or O
X-rays O
to O
compete O
with O
wild O
males O
for O
matings O
with O
wild O
females O
[ O
11 O
– O
13 O
]. O
Because O
An. O
gambiae O
females O
generally O
are O
monogamous, O
after O
mating O
with O
a O
sterile O
male, O
most O
females O
would O
only O
produce O
non-viable O
eggs. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
mosquito O
population O
would O
be O
significantly O
reduced O
after O
a O
few O
generations O
if O
sufficient O
mating O
with O
sterile O
males O
occurred O
[ O
14 O
]. O
The O
SIT O
is, O
however, O
a O
self-limiting O
strategy O
that O
depends O
on O
the O
continuous O
and O
periodic O
release O
of O
sterile O
male O
mosquitoes. O
The O
technical O
difficulties O
in O
separating O
males O
from O

in O
the O
mass O
production O
required O
for O
SIT, O
as O
well O
as O
the O

have O
limited O
the O

Delayed O

be O
an O

factor O
for O

both O
in O
severe O

and O
septic O

[ O

a O
fact O
that O
was O
confirmed O
in O
a O
recent O
systematic O
review O
of O
the O
literature O
[ O

Time O
to O
first O
antibiotic O
has O
been O
well O
studied, O
but O

has O
received O
less O

However, O
Leisman O

[ O

found O
that O
a O
major O
delay O
(&gt; O
25%) O
of O
the O

was O
associated O
with O
increased O
hospital O

This O
is O
supported O
by O

studies O
showing O
that O
optimising O

may O
increase O

[ O

]. O
The O

as O
a O

[ O

We O
are O

Consequently, O
less O
attention O
is O
paid O
to O

Our O
hypothesis O
was O
that O
early O

antibiotic O
treatment, O
i.e. O
first O

at O
the O

We O
immediately O
provide O
candidate O
genes O
for O
studying O
multiple O
stress O
responses O
in O
rice. O
For O
example, O
the O
prevalence O
of O
enriched O
ABRE-like O
promoter O
motifs O
suggest O
that O
the O
bZIP O
TFs O
identified O
here O
are O
good O
candidate O
regulators O
of O
stress O
responses O
(Fig. O
4 O
, O
Supplementary O
Data O
S1 O
). O
Our O
analysis O
only O
used O
studies O
with O
rice O
plants O
that O
were O
sensitive O
(susceptible) O
to O
the O
different O
stresses. O
Future O
researchers O
can O
expand O
on O
this O
work O
by O
analyzing O
the O
regulation O
of O
metaDEGs O
in O
studies O
with O
stress-tolerant O
rice O
varieties. O
We O
only O
found O
88 O
oppositely O
regulated O
metaDEGs O
between O
abiotic O
and O
biotic O
stresses, O
but O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
stress O
tolerance O
and O
sensitivity O
oppositely O
regulate O
many O
more O
genes. O
The O
resources O
and O
approach O
provided O
with O
this O
work O
will O
allow O
for O
a O
deeper O
understanding O
of O
rice O
strategies O
for O
overcoming O
stresses. O
We O
present O
this O
work O
as O
a O
proof O
of O
concept: O
meta-analysis O
of O
diverse O
transcriptomic O
data O
sets O
is O
a O
valid O
and O
robust O
approach O
to O
develop O
hypotheses O
for O
how O
plants O
respond O
to O
stress O
in O
general. O
It O
is O
also O
possible O
to O
expand O
our O
approach O
into O
other O
systems. O
For O
example, O
with O
the O
wealth O
of O
publicly O
available O
Arabidopsis O
transcriptome O
data, O
researchers O
can O
repeat O
this O
analysis O
to O
identify O
candidate O
regulators O
of O
Arabidopsis O
stress O
response. O
In O
systems O
with O
few O
or O
no O
publicly O
available O
transcriptome O
studies, O
the O
analysis O
we O
describe O
enables O
researchers O
to O
design O
transcriptome O
studies O
from O
the O
ground O
up O
to O
study O
stress O
response O
in O
their O
systems. O
Even O
while O
limited O
by O
the O
available O
rice O
stress-responsive O
transcriptome O
data, O
with O
multiple O
tissue O
types, O
host O
cultivars, O
and O
few O
replicates O
per O
treatment O
(Table O
2 O
), O
real O
trends O
were O
identified, O
indicating O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
design O
experiments O
in O
less O
well-studied O
plant O
systems O
to O
use O
with O
our O
approach. O
To O
summarize, O
publicly O
available O
rice O
transcriptome O
data O
were O
used O
to O
identify O
genes O
and O
pathways O
regulated O
by O
abiotic O
stress, O
biotic O
stress, O
and O
both O
stress O
types. O
We O
confirmed O
that O
photosynthesis O
is O
a O
generally O
down-regulated O
pathway O
in O
response O
to O
all O
stress O
types. O
We O
also O
identified O
stress-induced O
plant O
hormone-responsive O
genes, O
particularly O
genes O
downstream O
of O
ABA, O
JA O
and O
SA. O

Background O
Reef-building O
corals O
are O
amongst O
the O
most O
extensively O
studied O
animals O
in O
the O

At O
the O
turn O
of O
the O

the O
diversity O
and O
distribution O
of O
zooxanthellate O
stony O
coral O
species O
(Cnidaria: O
Anthozoa: O

had O
appeared O
to O
be O
precisely O
characterised O
and O
resolved O
(Veron O
1995 O
, O
2000 O
, O
2002 O
). O
Yet, O
phylogenetic O
analyses O
performed O
in O
the O
last O
two O
decades O
have O
shown O
the O
need O
for O
a O
plethora O
of O
taxonomic O
revisions O
(Fukami O

These O

our O

the O

even O
the O

a O
‘lab O

for O
coral O
experimental O
studies O
(Keshavmurthy O
et O
al. O
2013 O
), O
owing O
to O
it O
being O
purportedly O
common O
and O
wide-ranging, O
both O
geographically O
and O
ecologically O
(Veron O

Pacific O
Ocean, O
has O
revealed O
that O
it O
comprises O
four O

lineages, O
with O
two O
of O
them O
more O
closely O
related O
to O
Seriatopora O

the O

(Keshavmurthy O

considerable O
genetic O
variation O
despite O
limited O
morphological O
distinction O
among O
these O
lineages O
(Stefani O

) O
means O
that O
biological O
and O
ecological O
inferences O
made O
at O
the O
species O
level O
have O
to O
be O
constrained O
within O
each O
of O
the O

Infection O
with O
EV71 O
in O
children O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
severity, O
including O
hand-foot-and-mouth O
disease O
(HFMD), O
encephalitis, O
acute O
flaccid O
paralysis, O
tachycardia O
(135–250 O
heartbeats O
per O

cardiopulmonary O
failure, O
and O
death. O
EV71 O
is O
closely O
related O
to O
poliovirus, O
hepatitis O
A, O
and O
coxsackievirus O
6 O
– O
9 O
. O
Recently, O
another O
close O
relative O
of O
EV71, O
enterovirus O
D68 O
(EV-D68), O
is O
emerging O
as O
a O
global O
infectious O
disease, O
particularly O
in O
North O
America O
10 O
. O
In O
the O
2014 O
outbreak, O
at O
least O
2000 O
cases O
of O
EV-D68 O
were O
reported O
from O
20 O
countries O
worldwide. O
EV-D68 O
is O
also O
associated O
with O
severe O
respiratory O
disease O
and O
acute O
flaccid O
paralysis. O
Altogether, O
reemerging O
non-polio O
enterovirus O
represents O
a O
new O
major O
threat O
to O
the O
public O
health. O
While O

and O
no O

Sudden O
death O
and O

are O
most O
common O
in O
fatal O
cases O
of O

It O
is O

Discussion O

The O

barley O
as O
a O
valuable O
crop O
in O
their O
rotation, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
not O
always O
a O
profitable O
one. O
Economic O
rather O
than O
agronomic O
factors O
were O
considered O
the O
biggest O
barriers O
to O
the O
expanded O
production O
of O
barley. O
However, O
yield O
was O
by O
far O
the O
most O
important O
agronomic O
trait O
identified O
by O
growers, O
followed O
by O
disease O
resistance O
and O
competitiveness O
with O
weeds. O
Organic O
producers O
said O
that O
they O
would O
grow O
more O
barley O
if O
the O
price O
was O
higher O
and O
the O
profit O
margin O
was O
greater. O

According O

these O

two O
subfamilies, O
AMT1 O

that O
a O

performed O
comparably O
in O
the O

at O

indicating O
normal O
general O

and O

(Fig. O

We O
next O
assessed O
the O
presence O
of O
hypomyelination O
and O
cerebellar O
atrophy, O
which O
are O
the O
main O
pathological O
features O
of O
POLR3-HLD. O

Coronal O

sections O
from O

stained O

against O
Proteolipid O
protein O
(PLP), O
one O
of O
the O
main O
protein O
components O
of O
myelin, O
were O
indistinguishable O
from O
age-matched O
WT O
mice, O
suggesting O
that O
DM O
mice O
undergo O
complete O
myelination O
(Fig. O

Moreover, O
Nissl O
staining O
and O
Purkinje O
cell O
counts O
showed O
normal O
cerebellar O
integrity O
in O
DM O
mice O
(Fig. O

Altogether, O
our O
behavioral O
and O
histological O
data O
indicate O
that O
DM O
mice O
do O
not O
recapitulate O
the O
phenotypic O
or O
pathological O
features O
of O
POLR3-HLD O
at O
6 O
months O
of O
age, O
and O
thus O
that O
the O
heterozygous O
Polr3b O
c.308G O
&gt; O
A O
mutation O
does O
not O
lead O
to O
a O
phenotype O
in O
Polr3a O
G672E/G672E O
mice. O
Lastly, O
we O
evaluated O
the O
transcriptional O
impact O
of O
Polr3a O
and O
Polr3b O
mutations O
in O
the O
brain O
of O
DM O
mice. O
Using O
RNA-sequencing O
(RNA-seq), O
we O
found O
that O
Polr3a O
and O
Polr3b O
mRNA O
levels O
were O
comparable O
in O
WT O
and O
DM O
mice O
(Fig. O
5 O
a), O
providing O
further O
evidence O
that O
the O
two O
missense O
mutations O
do O
not O
alter O
mRNA O
stability. O
Furthermore, O
the O
three O
Pol O
III O
transcripts O
detected O
by O
this O
technique O
(Rpph1, O
Rmrp O
and O
Rn7sk) O
appeared O
unaffected O
by O
the O
Polr3a O
and O
Polr3b O
mutations O
(Fig. O
5 O
b). O

At O
last, O
compared O
with O
all O
other O
memory O
subsets O
and O
treatments, O
the O
FitSNE O
projection O
demonstrated O
a O
well-defined O
cluster O
based O
on O
the O
immuno-metabolic O
state O
of O
this O
perturbed O
T O
CM O
subset O
(Fig. O
4e O
, O
Supplementary O

), O
indicating O
population’s O
specific O
metabolic O
state. O
Taken O
together, O
we O
show O
that O
Met-Flow O
can O
dissect O
metabolic O
profiles O
within O
T-cell O
memory O
subsets. O
We O
identified O
the O
selective O
expansion O
of O
T O
CM O
cells, O
that O
is O
independent O
of O
glycolysis. O
Met-Flow O
captures O
divergent O
immuno-metabolic O
states O
in O
cellular O
subpopulations O
that O
arise O
during O
different O
cellular O
and O

environments. O
Increased O

and O

in O
activated O
T O

To O
confirm O
the O
metabolic O
reprogramming O
by O
flow O

we O
assessed O
real-time O
respiration O
in O
bulk O
T O
cells O
using O
extracellular O
flux O
analysis, O
which O
analyses O
glycolytic O
function O
and O
mitochondrial O
respiration. O
As O
expected, O
CD3/28 O
addition O
induced O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
glycolytic O
function, O
with O
elevated O
basal O
glycolysis, O
glycolytic O
capacity O
and O
reserve, O
compared O
with O
untreated O
controls O
(Fig. O
5a, O

). O
Mitochondrial O
respiration O
was O
significantly O
impacted, O
revealing O
enhanced O
basal, O
maximal O
respiration, O
and O
spare O
mitochondrial O
capacity O
(Fig. O
5c, O

). O
These O
metabolic O
shifts O
in O
glycolysis O
and O
OXPHOS O
confirmed O
our O
metabolic O
protein O
flow O

results O
(Fig. O

). O
Moreover, O
these O
changes O
in O
real-time O

are O
supported O
by O

showing O

We O
next O
evaluated O
the O

on O

using O
2-FDG O
in O
real-time O

The O

in O
the O

For O
those O
that O

there O
were O
again O
distinct O
regional O
differences. O
The O
most O
common O
pathogen O
nationwide O
was O
stripe O
rust, O
which O
was O

the O
most O
important O
disease O
in O

the O
most O

However, O
this O

a O

This O
research O
project O
is O
also O
interested O
in O
determining O
the O
potential O
interest O
organic O
farmers O
have O
in O
the O
adopting O
naked O
(free O
threshing) O
barley O
varieties. O
Nearly O
25% O
of O
the O
respondents O
had O
grown O
naked O
barley O
in O
the O
past O
three O
years. O
However, O
many O
indicated O
that O
they O
were O
unfamiliar O
with O
naked O
barley O
or O
had O
no O
experience O
with O
it. O
The O
producers O
reported O
smaller O
average O
plantings O
and O
considerably O
lower O
yields O
for O
naked O
barley. O
The O
average O
area O
planted O
to O
naked O
barley O
was O
9 O
ha, O
with O
an O
average O
yield O
of O
2283 O
kg/ha. O
The O
primary O
obstacle O
to O
planting O
more O
naked O
barley O
named O
by O
producers O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
seed. O
This O
was O
followed O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
winter O
hardiness, O
an O
insufficient O
premium O
over O
covered O
varieties, O
and O
insufficient O
storage O
capacity O
to O
keep O
varieties O
separate. O
Two O
producers O
who O
had O
grown O
naked O
barley O
in O
the O
past O
reported O
that O
not O
all O
the O
grains O
free-threshed O
and O
that O
some O
dehulling O
was O
required. O
Interviews O
All O
of O
the O
farmers O
who O
were O
interviewed O
talked O
about O
how O
barley O
fits O
within O
their O
production O
system O
and O
crop O
rotation. O
While O
there O
were O
common O
elements, O
each O
producer O
had O
a O
unique O
way O
of O
integrating O
barley O
into O
their O
farming O
system, O
in O
terms O
of O
place O
in O
rotation, O
cultural O
practices, O
variety O
selection, O
and O
end O
use. O
Several O
producers O
grew O
barley O
for O
multiple O
end-uses O
and O
were O
interested O
in O
a O
multi-purpose O
barley. O
Barley O
was O
the O
main O
crop O
only O
for O
farmers O
who O
were O
contract O
growing O
for O
malt O
houses. O
For O
those O
producers, O
variety O

was O
made O
by O

from O
the O
buyer. O

To O
that O
end, O
Vero O

were O

or O
a O
combination O
of O
both O
in O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
meliacine O
under O
different O

conditions. O
To O
perform O
these O
experiments O
instead O
of O
meliacine, O
we O
worked O
with O
the O
compound O
1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin O

Background O
As O
the O
first O
barrier O
against O
environmental O
insults, O
the O
skin O
has O
a O
vital O
physiological O
function. O
Large-area O
skin O
defects O
caused O
by O
burns O
and O
trauma O
can O
lead O
to O
pathogen O
invasion, O
dysregulation O
of O
body O
temperature, O
water O
loss O
from O
the O
body, O
and O
other O
serious O
consequences O
that O
endanger O
life O
[ O
1 O
– O
3 O
]. O
It O
is O
therefore O
critical O
to O
repair O
skin O
defects O
quickly. O
Split-thickness O
skin O
grafting O
is O
the O
current O
gold O
standard O
treatment O
for O
significant O
traumatic O
skin O
loss, O
especially O
from O
burn O
injuries O
[ O
4 O
]. O
However, O
for O
burns O
spanning O
a O
large O
area, O
split-thickness O
skin O
grafting O
may O
be O
limited O
by O
the O
availability O
of O
donor O
skin. O
To O
overcome O
this O
problem, O
split-thickness O
skin O
grafts O
are O
typically O
minced O
into O
micrografts O
to O
increase O
the O
expansion O
ratio; O
however, O
this O
can O
compromise O
wound O
healing O
quality. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
dermal O
tissue O
defects, O
fibroblasts O
secrete O
immature O
extracellular O
matrix O
(ECM) O
into O
the O
wound O
area, O
leading O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
scars. O
A O
newly O
formed O
epidermis O
cannot O
establish O
close O
contact O
with O
dermal O
tissue, O
because O
a O
new O
basement O
membrane O
cannot O
be O
established; O
as O
a O
result O
of O
this O
unstable O
epidermal-dermal O
connection, O
the O
epidermis O
readily O
blisters O
and O
falls O
off, O
leading O
to O
chronic O
ulcers O
[ O

]. O
In O
the O
1980s, O
the O
burn O
center O
at O
the O
Shanghai O
Ruijin O
Hospital O
carried O
out O
a O
clinical O
study O
of O
skin O
autografts O
combined O
with O
an O
allograft O
in O
a O
procedure O
known O
as O
intermingled O
transplantation. O
This O
technique O
involved O
wrapping O
a O
sheet O
allograft O
around O
the O
wound O
and O
punching O
holes O
about O
1 O
cm O

A O
study O
of O
12 O
patients O
who O
underwent O
this O
procedure O
documented O
the O
so-called O
sandwich O
phenomenon, O
whereby O
the O
skin O
autograft O
migrates O
between O
the O
dermis O
and O
epidermis O
of O
the O
allograft, O
causing O
it O
to O
degenerate O
as O
a O
result O
of O
host O
rejection O
while O
leaving O
the O
autograft O
intact. O
The O
allograft O
thus O
protects O
the O
autograft O
during O
the O
healing O
process. O
Since O
allogenic O
dermis O
is O
slowly O
degraded, O
it O
may O
serve O
as O
a O
scaffold O
to O
promote O
autologous O
dermal O

This O

was O
done O
in O

Even O
though O
an O
initial O
study O
indicated O
that O
cyp128a1 O
was O
among O
the O
essential O
genes O
unique O
to O
mycobacteria, O
this O
could O
not O
be O
confirmed O
in O
later O
TraSH O
studies O
(Sassetti O
et O

2003 O
; O
Lamichhane O
et O

2011 O
; O
Zhang O
et O
al. O
2012 O
; O
DeJesus O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
These O
contradictory O
results O
could O
be O
due O
to O
the O
limited O
gene O
coverage O
of O
some O
of O
the O
transposon O
libraries. O
Interestingly, O
disruption O
of O
the O
orphan O
cyp136a1 O
provided O
a O
growth O
advantage O
in O

(DeJesus O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Even O
though O
cyp121a1 O
was O
found O
to O
be O
non-essential O
in O
these O
genome-wide O
transposon O
studies, O
cyp121a1 O
could O
only O
be O
knocked O
out O
in O
Mtb O
H37Rv O
after O
creating O
a O
merodiploid O
strain. O
This O
indicates O
that O
this O
gene O
is O
required O
for O
growth O
under O
in O
vitro O
conditions O
(McLean O
et O
al. O
2008 O
). O
Transposon O

studies O
were O
also O
conducted O
on O
bacterial O
cultures O
grown O
in O
conditions O
that O
the O

encounters O
during O
infection O
in O
the O
human O
host. O
These O
studies O
aimed O
to O
identify O
the O
mechanisms O
used O
by O
the O
bacterium O
to O
resist O
these O
insults. O
Griffin O
et O
al. O
identified O
cyp125a1 O
as O
the O
sole O
monooxygenase O
essential O
for O
Mtb O
H37Rv O
growth O
in O
cholesterol, O
an O
essential O
carbon O
source O
during O
Mtb O
infection. O
Furthermore, O
cyp125a1 O
was O
found O
to O
be O
essential O
during O
mouse O
infection O
(Sassetti O
and O
Rubin O
2003 O
). O
Although O
cyp125a1 O
was O
not O
found O
to O
be O
required O
for O
macrophage O
infection, O
it O
is O
part O
of O
the O
fadE28 O
locus, O
which O
is O
a O
critical O
operon O
involved O
in O
lipid O
transport, O
lipid O
degradation O
and O
assimilation O
of O
exogenous O
lipids O
from O
host O
cell O
membranes O
(Cole O

1998 O
; O
McKinney O
et O
al. O
2000 O
; O
Rengarajan O
et O

2005 O
). O

In O
agreement O
with O
this O
theory, O
lower O
rates O
of O
EAAT1 O
and O
EAAT2 O
activity O
are O
considered O
a O
cause O
of O
depressive O
disorders O
[ O
49 O
]. O
A O
study O
showed O
that O
patients O
who O
suffered O
from O
MDD O
showed O
significant O
downregulation O
of O
EAAT1 O
and O
EAAT2 O
in O
postmortem O
cerebral O
cortex O
[ O
50 O
]. O
Another O
study O
reported O
that O
levels O
of O
GLAST O
and O
GLT-1 O
could O
be O
changed O
by O
exposure O
to O
chronic O
stress O
[ O
51 O
]. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
our O
results O
showed O
that O
the O
reduced O
expression O
of O
EAAT2 O
protein O
and O
mRNA O
and O
EAAT1 O
protein O
in O
the O
PFC O
of O
CUMS O
mice O
was O
in O
agreement O
with O
similar O
studies, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
EAAT1 O
mRNA. O
Additionally, O
the O
negative O
changes O
in O
EAAT1 O
mRNA O
in O
the O
PFC O
of O
mice O
in O
the O
CUMS O
group O
are O
also O
not O
accidental. O
It O
was O
shown O
in O
a O
previous O
study O
that O
21-day O
CUMS O
significantly O
reduced O
the O
expression O
of O
EAAT2 O
protein O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
of O
an O
MCAO O
animal O
model, O
while O
EAAT2 O
mRNA O
expression O
levels O
did O
not O
change O
significantly O
[ O
52 O
]. O
Together, O
these O
findings O
indicate O
that O
the O
inconsistency O
in O
EAAT1 O
protein O
and O
gene O
expression O
might O
be O
attributable O
to O
the O
differential O
timing O
of O
protein O
and O
gene O
expression O
under O
the O
action O
of O
CUMS O
and O
drugs. O
Our O
results O
also O
indicated O
that O
a O
reduction O
in O
EAAT1 O
and O
EAAT2 O
could O
be O
reversed O
by O
XYS O
or O
FLU O
treatment. O
Consistent O
with O
a O
previous O
study O
[ O
53 O
], O
pathological O
changes O
such O
as O
decreased O
cortical O
neuronal O
cells, O
and O
disordered O
arrangement, O
nuclear O
loss, O
nucleus O
light O
staining, O
swelling, O
fragmentation, O
and O
even O
vacuolization O
and O
nuclear O
pyknosis. O
All O
of O
the O
above O
changes O
in O
CUMS O
mice O
could O
be O
reversed O
by O
XYS O
and O
Flu O
treatments. O
Hence, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
suspect O
that O
CUMS O
would O
lead O
to O
decreased O
expression O
of O
GFAP, O
EAAT1, O
EAAT2, O
and O
NeuN O
and O
an O
increase O
in O
glutamate O
content O
in O
the O
PFC O
of O
mice, O
which O
could O
be O
reversed O
by O
XYS O
treatment. O

species O
listed O
in O
the O
List O
of O
Prokaryotic O
Names O
(October O

). O
Members O
of O
this O
genus O
represent O
an O
extremely O
diverse O
group O
of O
species O
with O
various O
physiological, O
biochemical, O
and O
genetic O
characteristics O
and O
are O
able O
to O
colonize O
diverse O
ecological O
niches, O
including O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
(GIT) O
of O
humans O
and O
animals, O
plants, O
and O
dairy O
food O
environments O
(Makarova O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
Kandler O
1983 O
). O
Lactobacilli O
are O
rod-shaped, O
Gram-positive, O
non-spore-forming, O
lactic O
acid-producing, O
generally O
nonmotile O
bacteria O
that O
can O
survive O
mainly O
in O
anaerobic O
environments O
(Claesson O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Kandler O
1983 O
). O
Due O
to O
their O
advantageous O
properties O
and O
a O
long O
history O
of O
safe O
use, O
lactobacilli O
are O
used O
as O
starter O
cultures O
in O
both O
traditional O
fermentation O
and O
various O
industrial O
bioprocesses O
(Stiles O
and O
Holzapfel O
1997 O
). O
Furthermore, O
having O
the O
generally O
recognized O
as O
safe O
(GRAS) O
status, O
many O
species O
are O
considered O
probiotics, O
i.e., O
live O
microorganisms O
intended O
to O
confer O
health O

al. O
2002 O
; O
Lebeer O
et O

2008 O
). O
The O
probiotic O
properties O
of O
microorganisms O
are O
determined O
by O
factors O
that O
include O
their O
adaptation O
to O
the O
GIT O
and O
those O
directly O
mediating O
the O
health O
effects O
to O
the O
host. O
The O
adaptation O
factors O
include O
the O
ability O
to O
survive O
in O
the O
harsh O
conditions O
of O
the O
GIT O
(low O
pH O
and O
high O
concentration O
of O
bile O

and O
adherence O
to O
mucosal O
surfaces O
(mucus, O

To O

we O

using O
the O

[ O

A O

gene O
encoding O
an O

was O
found O
to O
be O
upregulated O
upon O

This O

according O
to O
its O

[ O

The O

was O
further O
confirmed O
by O

Analysis O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O

revealed O
that O
during O
a O

the O
transcription O

TaAMT2;3a O
was O
induced O
as O
early O
as O
6 O

and O
reached O
the O

hpi, O
which O
was O
7.3-fold O
higher O
than O
that O
in O
the O

(Fig. O

The O
mRNA O
levels O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O
in O
different O
wheat O
tissues O
(roots, O

were O
examined. O
The O
results O
indicated O
that O
TaAMT2;3a O

detectable O
in O
all O

and O
the O

in O

were O
significantly O
higher O
than O
those O
in O
roots O
and O

(Fig. O

These O
results O
suggested O
that O
TaAMT2;3a O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
transporting O
ammonium O
in O
the O
leaves O
and O
play O
an O

Immunological O

About O
two-thirds O
of O
people O
with O
A-T O
have O
abnormalities O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
[ O
28 O
, O
29 O
]. O
The O
most O
common O
abnormalities O
are O
low O
levels O
of O
one O
or O
more O
classes O
of O
immunoglobulin O
(IgG, O
IgA, O
IgM O
or O
IgG O
subclasses), O
failure O
to O
make O
antibodies O
in O
response O
to O
vaccines O
or O
infections, O
and O
lymphopenia, O
especially O
affecting O
T-lymphocytes. O
There O
are O
reduced O
numbers O
of O
new O
B O
cells O
leaving O
the O
bone O
marrow O
and O
new O
T O
cells O
leaving O
the O
thymus O
[ O

], O
reduced O
proportions O
of O
naive O
B O
and O
T O
cells, O
and O
reduced O
antigen O
receptor O

[ O
29 O
]. O
A O
small O
percentage O
of O
people O
with O
A-T O
also O
may O
have O
elevated O
levels O
of O
IgM O
in O
combination O
with O
IgG O
and/or O
IgA O
deficiency. O
When O
this O
is O
the O
presenting O
symptom O
in O
infant- O
or O
childhood, O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
A-T O
can O
be O
confused O
with O
that O
of O
hyper-IgM O
syndrome O
[ O
31 O
]. O
In O
the O
majority O
of O
individuals O
with O
A-T, O
the O
immunologic O
abnormalities O
do O
not O
deteriorate O
over O
time, O
but O
approximately O
10% O
will O
develop O
more O
severe O
problems O
most O
often O
with O
humoral O
immunity O
[ O
28 O
, O
32 O
]. O
Sinopulmonary O
infections O
are O
common O
in O
people O
with O
A-T O
[ O
28 O
, O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
All O
children O
with O
A-T O
should O
have O
their O
immune O
systems O
evaluated O
to O
detect O
those O
with O
severe O
problems O
that O
require O
treatment O
to O
minimize O
the O
number O
or O
severity O
of O
infections. O
People O
with O
A-T O
have O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
developing O
autoimmune O
or O
chronic O
inflammatory O
diseases. O
This O
risk O
is O
probably O
a O
secondary O
effect O
of O
their O
immunodeficiency O
and O
not O
a O
direct O
effect O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
ATM O
protein. O
The O
most O
common O
examples O
of O
such O
disorders O
in O
A-T O
include O
immune O
thrombocytopenia O
(ITP), O
several O
forms O
of O
arthritis, O
and O
vitiligo. O

As O
an O
example, O
Mtb O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
capable O
of O
altering O
essential O
host O
functions O
by O
the O
release O
of O
polyketides O
that O
can O
induce O
a O
G0/G1 O
cell O
cycle O
arrest O
in O
the O
macrophages. O
As O
a O
result, O
mycobacteria O
are O
capable O
of O
challenging O
innate O
killing O
mechanisms O
and O
evade O
the O
adaptive O
immune O
system O
as O
non-cycling O
cells O
are O
less O
likely O
to O
be O
killed O
by O
cytotoxic O
T O
cells O
(Nishioka O
and O
Welsh O
1994 O
; O
Cumming O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Pks9 O
is O
an O
immunogenic O
protein O
(Kumar O
et O
al. O
2011 O
), O
whereas O
pks17 O
(together O
with O
pks8, O
Rv1662) O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
production O
of O
methyl-branched O
fatty O
acids O
which O
are O
minor O
components O
of O
sulfolipids O
and O
acyltrehaloses O
(Dubey O
et O
al. O
2003 O
). O
Pks11 O
could O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
assembly O
of O
alkylpyrones O
from O
fatty O
acyl-CoA O
and O
malonyl-CoA O
(Saxena O
et O
al. O
2003 O
; O
Gokulan O
et O
al. O
2013 O
), O
but O
the O
production O
of O
long-chain O
α-pyrone O
metabolites O
in O
Mtb O
has O
not O
been O
shown. O
Hence, O
CYP139A1 O
could O
play O
a O
conserved O
role O
in O
the O
modification O
and/or O
transport O
of O
these O
Psk-derived O
molecules O
and O
it O
could O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
host-pathogen O
interactions. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
observation O
that O
CYP139A1 O
is O
induced O
after O
exposure O
to O
antibiotics O
(see O
below) O
is O
intriguing O
and O
may O
suggest O
a O
role O
in O
detoxification. O
CYP143A1: O
component O
of O
the O
ESX-5 O
secretion O
locus O
The O
gene O
encoding O
the O
orphan O
enzyme O
CYP143A1 O
lies O
adjacent O
to O
Rv1786 O
encoding O
FdxE. O
This O
proximity O
suggests O
a O
CYP/redox O
partner O
association. O
Indeed, O
a O
significant O
binding O
affinity O
between O
FdxE O
and O
CYP143A1 O
was O
demonstrated O
with O
a O
K O
D O
value O
equal O
to O
10 O
−7 O
M O
(Lu O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
In O
Mtb O
and O
several O
closely O
related O
species, O
cyp143a1 O
is O
part O
of O
the O
esx-5 O
locus. O

Although O
ascorbate O
concentrations O
were O
not O
directly O
measured, O
it O
can O
be O
assumed, O
based O
on O
transcriptome O
data O
and O
the O
above O
mentioned O
results, O
that O
the O
ascorbate O
concentration O
is O
reduced, O
a O
status O
that O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
induction O
of O

. O
Furthermore, O
vitamin O

is O
an O

Concluding O
remarks O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
inoculation O
of O
lettuce O
cv. O
Tizian O
with O
R. O
solani O
AG1-IB O
causes O
large-scale O
reprogramming O
of O
the O
transcriptome O
and O
metabolome O
in O
lettuce O
leaf O
tissue. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
role O
of O
lettuce O
in O
the O
interaction O
is O
not O
as O
passive O
as O
was O
previously O
assumed. O
Analysis O
of O

and O
the O

of O
PRG O
transcript O
levels O
between O
the O
three O
interaction O
zones O
very O
much O
corroborates O
active O
defence O
efforts O
of O
lettuce. O
The O
defence O
reaction O
of O
lettuce O
has O
more O
in O
common O
with O
a O
guarded O
retreat, O
where O
spread O
of O
the O
fungus O
is O
minimized O
or O
retarded, O
instead O
of O
an O
offensive O
defence O
approach. O
In O
the O

we O
postulated O
that O
an O

can O
be O
beneficial O
during O
the O
initial O
phase O
of O
interaction. O
Eventually, O
though, O
during O
the O
infective O
phase O
of O
interaction O
R. O
solani O
is O
a O
necrotrophic O
pathogen O
and O
JA O
mediated O
defences O
should O
be O
dominant. O
Therefore, O
the O
consistent O
down-regulation O
of O
JAR1 O
and O
several O
auxin O
responsive O
genes O
was O
very O
surprising, O
as O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
enrichment O
for O
SA O
responsive O
genes. O
The O
apparent O
improper O
regulation O
of O
JA O
and O
SA O
signalling, O
adapted O
to O
the O
specific O
interaction O
zones, O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
clear O
disadvantage O
and O
might O
weaken O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
lettuce O
local O
defence O
response. O
Alternatively, O
R. O
solani O
may O
actively O
interfere O
with O
host O
hormonal O
signalling, O
deregulating O
the O
defence O
response. O
In O
the O
future, O
more O
research O
is O
needed O
to O
confirm O
these O
findings, O
including O
experimental O
work O
with O
whole O
plant O
interaction O
models. O
As O
such, O
future O
work O
should O
address O
identification O
of O
elicitors O
responsible O
for O
inducing O
lettuce O
PCD/senescence O
within O
this O
pathosystem. O

Over O
the O
past O
decade, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
strong O
increase O
in O
the O
use O
of O
participants O
crowdsourced O
via O
online O
platforms, O
such O
as O
Amazon O
MTurk O
or O
CrowdFlower O
(e.g. O
Buhrmester O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Paolacci O
and O
Chandler O
2014 O
). O
Such O
expansion O
has O
benefited O
psychological O
research O
in O
many O
ways. O
For O
example, O
results O
from O
classic O
behavioural O
experiments O
(e.g. O
the O
Stroop O
Task; O
Stroop O
1935 O
) O
were O
shown O
to O
replicate O
well O
on O
these O
online O
platforms O
(Crump O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Even O
when O
studying O
political O
ideologies, O
it O
seems O
that O
MTurk O
is O
well-suited O
(Clifford O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
However, O
although O
Amazon O
boasts O
&gt; O
.5 O
million O
participants, O
the O
actual O
pools O
from O
which O
participants O
are O
sampled O
are O
much O
smaller, O
with O
the O
population O
estimated O
at O
around O
7300 O
individuals O
(Bohannon O
2016 O
). O
Moreover, O
while O
crowdsourcing O
platforms O
such O
as O
Amazon’s O
MTurk O
allow O
for O
sampling O
more O
diversely O
than O
typical O
student O
samples, O
for O
example O
with O
respect O
to O
age O
range, O
the O
participants O
remain O
predominantly O
WEIRD, O
with O
some O
notable O
exceptions O
(e.g. O
Raihani O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Evolutionary O
Psychology O
as O
an O
Exception? O
Since O
its O
inception, O
evolutionary O
psychology O
has O
stressed O
the O
importance O
of O
human O
universals O
(e.g. O
Buss O
1989 O
, O
1994 O
, O
1995 O
; O
Cosmides O
and O
Tooby O
1997 O
; O
Tooby O
and O
Cosmides O
1990 O
). O
Empirical O
examples O
where O
researchers O
have O
evaluated O
whether O
universals O
exist O
by O
testing O
across O
different O
populations O
include O
studies O
of O
homicide O
(Daly O
and O
Wilson O
1988 O
), O
economic O
behaviour O
(e.g. O
Henrich O
et O
al. O
2005 O
) O
and O
mate O
preferences O
(e.g. O
Buss O
et O
al. O
2000 O
; O
Buss O
1989 O
; O
Schmitt O
2005 O
; O
Shackelford O
et O
al. O
2005 O
). O
Cross-cultural O
universals O
(see O
for O
example O
those O
listed O
in O
Brown O
1991 O
, O
2000 O
) O
are O
often O
used O
by O
evolutionary O
psychologists O
as O
evidence O
for O
adaptive O
psychological O
mechanisms O
(e.g. O
Buss O
1995 O
). O
It O
would O
thus O
seem, O
as O
Apicella O
and O
Barrett O
( O
2016 O
: O
p. O

Both O
cultural O
groups O
named O
specific O
mushrooms O
based O
on O
their O
ecological O
and O
morphological O
characteristics. O
The O
mestizos O
used O
simple O
or O
compound O
names O
that O
were O
usually O
descriptive O
(Berlin O
1992 O
). O
For O
example, O
chapeteadas, O
meaning O
rosy O
cheeks, O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
reddish O
colour O
in O
Calvatia O
sp., O
or O
corralitos O
(small O
corral) O
after O
the O
growth O
of O
Marasmius O
oreades O
in O
fairy O
rings. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
compound O
names O
often O
began O
with O
the O
shape O
of O
the O
mushrooms, O
such O
as O
oreja O
(ear) O
or O
hongo O
(typical O
mushroom O
with O
cap O
and O
stipe), O
followed O
by O
the O
place O
or O
tree O
where O
the O
species O
grows, O
for O
instance, O
Volvariella O
bombycina O
is O
called O
hongo O
de O
ochote O
(mushroom O
from O
ochote, O
Ipomea O
intrapilosa O
wood). O
Ustilago O
maydis O
was O
the O
species O
with O
most O
common O
names; O
even O
so, O
it O
was O
previously O
thought O
that O
this O
fungus O
was O
not O
traditionally O
consumed O
in O
Jalisco O
(Guzmán-Dávalos O
1992 O
). O
The O
mestizos O
called O
this O
cuervo O
(raven) O
for O
the O
black O
colour O
and O
its O
relationship O
with O
maize. O
In O
addition, O
the O
names O
huilanconche O
and O
pitacoche O
were O
recorded. O
These O
latter O
two O
terms O
are O
phonetic O
modifications O
of O
the O
term O
cuitlacoche O
(corn O
smut), O
a O
term O
which O
originated O
in O
central O
Mexico O
(Guzmán O
2008 O
). O
Meanwhile, O
the O
Wixaritari O
named O
mushrooms O
with O
a O
single O
word, O
such O
as O
yekwá O
(Amanita O
laurae O
or O
A. O
basii) O
or O
wakanari O
(Marasmius O
oreades), O
or O
with O
two O
words, O
such O
as O
utuxa O
yekwá O
(Volvariella O
bombycina), O
utuxa O
being O
their O
name O
for O
Ipomea O
intrapilosa. O
When O
a O
binomial O
name O
was O
used, O
the O
first O
word O
was O
related O
to O
the O
plant O
or O
animal O
association, O
and O
the O
second O
to O
the O
form, O
although O
the O
order O
was O
reversed O
in O
some O
cases, O
with O
the O
first O
word O
referring O
to O
morphology O
and O
the O
second O
to O
colour. O

This O
supports O
earlier O
monocyte O
work O
showing O
that O
activation-induced O
upregulation O
is O
dependent O
on O
glycolysis O
54 O
. O
In O
addition, O
our O
findings O
show O
divergent O
metabolic O
requirements O
in O
DC O
subpopulations O
following O
activation O
55 O
. O
We O
observed O
higher O
capacity O
for O
flux O
through O
arginine O
metabolism O
in O
mDCs, O
compared O
with O
higher O
OXPHOS O
capacity O
and O
glucose O
uptake O
in O
pDCs. O
NK O
subset O
characterization O
revealed O
that O
CD56 O
bright O
cells O
expressed O
significantly O
higher O
HK1, O
confirming O
increased O
glycolytic O
activity O
in O
comparison O
to O
CD56 O
dim O
cells O
56 O
. O
Moreover, O
we O
highlight O
an O
opposing O
requirement O
for O
lipid O
metabolism, O
with O
higher O
fatty-acid O
synthesis O
enzyme O
ACAC O
in O
CD56 O
bright O
cells, O
compared O
with O
increased O
capacity O
for O
flux O
through O
oxidation O
by O
CPT1A O
in O
CD56 O
dim O
cells. O
NKT O
cells O
had O
higher O
levels O
of O
IDH2 O
in O
comparison O
with O
CD4 O
+ O
T O
cells, O
which O
verifies O
studies O
showing O
increased O
OXPHOS O
in O
NKT O
cells, O
important O
for O
their O
function O
57 O
. O
Taken O
together, O
this O
demonstrates O
the O
ability O
of O
Met-Flow O
to O
simultaneously O
analyze O
diverse O
metabolic O
states O
on O
differential O
immune O
subpopulations. O
The O
association O
of O
immune O
and O
metabolic O
states O
has O
been O
extensively O
studied O
in O
T-cell O
biology, O
including O
increased O
glycolysis, O
OXPHOS, O
and O
fatty-acid O
synthesis O
following O
activation O
1 O
, O
26 O
, O
39 O
, O
58 O
– O
60 O
. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
confirmed O
these O
findings O
and O
further O
demonstrated O
the O
involvement O
of O
PPP, O
fatty-acid O
oxidation, O
antioxidant, O
and O
arginine O
synthesis O
post-activation. O
Using O
Met-Flow, O
we O
confirmed O
the O
highly O
oxidative O
phenotype O
of O
CD4 O
+ O
in O
comparison O
to O
CD8 O
+ O
cells O
31 O
. O
Though O
expression O
of O
the O
glycolytic O
enzyme O
HK1 O
was O
similar O
between O
both O
subsets, O
the O
PPP O
was O
significantly O
induced O
in O
CD8 O
+ O
T O
cells, O
indicating O
a O
differential O
metabolic O
program O
utilizing O
glucose O
breakdown. O
We O
also O
confirmed O
that O
activation-induced O
expression O
of O
the O
high O
affinity O
IL-2 O
receptor, O
CD25, O
is O
dependent O
on O
glycolysis. O
Importantly, O
CD25 O
expression O
positively O
correlated O
with O
GLUT1 O
protein O
levels, O
confirming O
the O
association O
with O
activation-induced O
glucose O
uptake. O

However, O
in O
2006, O
symbionts O
of O
the O
clinical O
Photorhabdus O
strain, O
i.e. O
heterorhabditid O
nematodes, O
were O
described O
and O
classified O
as O
Heterorhabditis O
gerrardi O
(Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2004 O
; O
Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
Plichta O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
Thus, O
it O
is O
now O
accepted O
that O
human O
pathogenic O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
are O
able O
to O
form O
a O
mutualistic O
relationships O
with O
Heterorhabditis O
nematodes O
to O
infect O
insects O
efficiently, O
like O
other O
Photorhabdus O
nematode O
symbionts. O
Currently, O
two O
species: O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
comprise O
both O
clinical O
and O
entomopathogenic O
Photorhabdus O
strains O
derived O
from O
various O
locations O
(Kuwata O
et O
al. O
2008 O
; O
Thanwisai O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
To O
address O
the O
particular O
life O
style O
of O
Photorhabdus O
human O
pathogens, O
their O
diversity O
and O
evolutionary O
relationships O
have O
been O
intensively O
explored O
by O
implementing O
whole O
genome O
sequencing O
and O
transcriptomic O
analysis. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
bacteria O
have O
a O
relatively O
small O
genome, O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
P. O
luminesces O
(the O
closest O
relative), O
and O
display O
lower O
diversity O
of O
insecticidal O
toxins. O
The O
existence O
of O
many O
supplementary O
plasmids O
and O
pathogenicity O
islands O
in O
the O
genome O
has O
also O
been O
shown O
(Wilkinson O
et O
al. O
2009 O
, O
2010 O
). O
Current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
switch O
of O
these O
bacteria O
from O
nematodes O
to O
humans O
was O
facilitated O
by O
virulence O
genes O
(necessary O
for O
insect O
host O
infection) O
already O
present O
in O
the O
genome, O
as O
well O
as O
additional O
virulence O
factors O
(appropriate O
for O
infection O
of O
mammalian O
cells) O
acquired O
by O
horizontal O
transfer O
from O
other O
human O
pathogens O
(Hapeshi O
and O
Waterfield O
2017 O
). O
Unlike O
other O
species O
of O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus, O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
can O
grow O
at O
37 O
°C, O
undergoing O
the O
metabolic O
shift O
to O
adapt O
their O
metabolisms O
to O
the O
mammalian O
host O
(Mulley O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O

For O
immunity O
to O
pathogens, O
plants O
primarily O
rely O
on O
salicylic O
acid O
(SA), O
JA O
and O
ethylene O
signaling. O
The O
abiotic O
stress O
response O
is O
regulated O
by O
many O
transcription O
factor O
(TF) O
families, O
both O
ABA-dependent O
and O
ABA-independent. O
The O
former O
includes O
ABA-induced O
basic O
leucine O
zipper O
(bZIP) O
TFs O
16 O
, O
17 O
. O
These O
TFs O
induce O
stomatal O
closure, O
expression O
of O
dehydration O
tolerance O
genes, O
and O
other O
adaptive O
physiological O
responses O
18 O
– O
22 O
. O
However, O
ABA O
often O
increases O
plant O
susceptibility O
in O
biotic O
interactions O
23 O
– O
27 O
and O
frequently O
acts O
antagonistically O
with O
SA O
28 O
– O
30 O
. O
With O
this O
study, O
we O
explore O
the O
rice O
transcriptome O
for O
a O
more O
thorough O
understanding O
of O
how O
rice O
regulates O
responses O
to O
multiple O
abiotic O
and O
biotic O
stresses. O
Previous O
studies O
have O
explored O
broad O
plant O
stress O
response O
by O
analyzing O
microarray O
data O
31 O
, O
32 O
. O
We O
expand O
on O
these O
studies O
with O
robust O
meta-analysis O
of O
publicly O
available O
rice O
RNA-Seq O
data O
sets. O
Our O
results O
reveal O
universally O
stress-regulated O
pathways, O
which O
we O
call O
the O
rice O
core O
stress O
response. O
The O
network O

presented O

can O
be O
further O
explored O
for O
rice O
improvement O
in O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
valuable O

for O
an O

Background O
Primary O
Ciliary O
Dyskinesia O
(PCD) O
is O
a O
genetically O
heterogeneous O
disorder O
characterized O
by O
laterality O
defects O
and O
recurrent O
respiratory O
infections O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Bronchiectasis O
may O
develop O
already O
in O
childhood O
[ O
2 O
] O
and O
it O
is O
usually O
present O
in O
most O
adult O
PCD O
patients O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Late O
diagnosis O
is O
associated O
with O
worse O
clinical O
picture, O
[ O
4 O
– O
6 O
] O
although O
even O
early O
diagnosis O
is O
followed O
by O
variable O
courses O
of O
lung O
function O
that O
are O
not O
linked O
to O
the O
level O
of O
lung O
function O
at O
diagnosis O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Management O
varies O
considerably O
between O
centers, O
as O
there O
are O
no O
evidence-based O
therapeutic O
guidelines O
for O
PCD O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Most O
of O
the O
current O
treatment O
protocols O
are O
extrapolated O
from O
Cystic O
Fibrosis O
(CF) O
studies. O
Historically, O
in O
CF O
patients O
with O
localized O
bronchiectasis, O
lung O
resection O
has O
been O
proposed O
as O
a O
measure O
to O
decrease O
infection O
burden O
and O
limit O
the O
damage O
to O
the O
remaining O
lung O
[ O
9 O
– O
11 O
]. O
However, O
a O
recent O
study O
from O
the O
US O
showed O
no O
improvement O
in O
lung O
function, O
hospital O
admissions O
or O
antibiotic O
use O
in O
CF O
patients O
after O
lung O
resection O
[ O
12 O
]. O
Similarly, O
a O
retrospective, O
small-scale O
study O
in O
children O
with O
non-CF O
bronchiectasis O
concluded O
that O
surgical O
treatment O
did O
not O
affect O
annual O
exacerbation O
rates O
and O
lung O
function O
but O
resulted O
in O
reductions O
the O
need O
for O
annual O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
[ O
13 O
]. O
Lung O
resection O
to O
treat O
PCD O
lung O
disease O
is O
generally O
not O
recommended, O
although O
it O
can O
be O
considered O
for O
selected O
cases O
of O
severe O
and O
localized O
bronchiectasis O
with O
recurrent O
suppurative O
infection, O
hemoptysis O
or O
specific O
infection O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Nevertheless, O
this O
approach O
remains O
controversial O
and O
to O
date, O
only O
two O
reports O
described O
the O
clinical O
course O
in O
PCD O
patients O
after O
lung O
resection, O
[ O
5 O
, O
15 O
] O
with O
conflicting O
results. O
The O
older O

compared O
13 O
adult O
lobectomised O
PCD O

PCD O
patients O
and O
did O
not O
find O
significant O

the O
two O
groups. O
Despite O
this, O
85% O

that O

(Fig. O

As O
observed O

the O
number O

On O

had O
only O

rates, O
an O

[ O

In O
this O
regard, O
strict O
compliance O
with O
the O
recommended O
decontamination O
process O
at O
all O
level O
is O
required O
[ O
9 O
– O
12 O
]. O
Since O
failure O
to O
properly O
disinfect O
or O
sterilize O
equipment O
carries O
not O
the O
only O
risk O
associated O
with O
a O
breach O
of O
host O
barriers O
but O
also O
the O
risk O
for O
person-to-person O
transmission O
(e.g., O
hepatitis O

virus) O
and O
transmission O
of O
environmental O
pathogens O
(e.g., O
Pseudomonas B-PATH

[ O

]. O
In O
Ethiopia, O
rigorous O
decontamination O
of O
reusable O
medical O
equipment O
is O
an O
important O
part O
of O
infection O
prevention O
and O
patient O
safety O
strategy O
[ O

However, O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
effort O
have O
not O
been O
felt O
across O
the O
country O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
healthcare O

have O
sub-optimal O
infection O

practice O
in O
Ethiopia O
[ O
10 O
, O
13 O
– O

]. O
In O
addition, O
contamination O
of O
medical O

like O
S. B-PATH

Moreover, O
concerns O
have O
been O
raised O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
HAIs O
[ O
17 O
– O

]. O
Given O
the O
reality O
that O
poor O
decontamination O

can O
result O
in O
a O
range O
of O
infections O
and O

factor O
for O

[ O

in O
the O
area O

[ O

In O
summary, O
Davis O
et O

present O
an O
intuitive O
and O
straightforward O
approach O
to O
identifying O
contamination O
in O
metagenomic O
sequencing O
experiments. O
When O
microbe O
sequencing O
quantity O
is O
inversely O
proportional O
to O
total O
sample O

mass, O
it O
is O
suspicious O
for O
contamination; O
we O
thus O
suggest O
that O
assessing O
the O
studentized O
residual O
for O
each O
sample O
can O
provide O
a O
probabilistic O
assessment O
of O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
a O
contaminant O
might O
also O
be O
present O
in O
the O
true O
sample O
metagenome. O
The O
inclusion O
of O
ERCC O
controls O
provides O
the O
additional O
benefit O
of O
allowing O
sample O
input O
mass O
to O
be O
calculated O
even O
for O
picogram-level O
samples. O
In O
short, O
this O
statistical O
approach O
allows O
an O
investigator O
to O
separate O
the O
estimated O
contribution O
from O
contamination O
from O
the O
true O
sample-derived O
component O
without O
censoring O
the O

had O
put O
together O
a O
diverse O
and O

meeting O

This O
meeting O
built O
on O
the O
success O
of O
the O
two O
previous O
meetings O
(Downs O
2011 O
; O
Stern O

) O
and O
included O
an O
expanded O
contribution O
from O

using O

systems. O
Indeed, O

presented O
not O
only O
the O
state O
of O
art O
knowledge O
on O
the O
interplay O
between O
embryonic O
and O
extraembryonic O
tissues, O
but O
also O
bridged O
diverse O
invertebrate O
and O
vertebrate O
animal O
models O
and O
illustrated O
the O
utility O
of O
advanced O
cell O

molecular O
biology O
approaches O
for O

core O
questions O
in O
developmental O
biology. O
Embryonic O
or O
extraembryonic? O
Cell O
fate O
specification O
in O
the O
early O

One O
of O
the O
core O
scientific O
questions O
recurring O
during O
the O
meeting O
was O
how O
cells O
are O
directed O
towards O
embryonic O
or O
extraembryonic O
fate. O
In O
case O
of O
mammals, O
the O
initial O
decisions O
are O
made O
in O
preimplantation O
embryos, O
where O
blastomeres O
first O
“decide” O
whether O
to O
form O
an O
inner O
cell O
mass O
(ICM) O
that O
gives O
rise O
to O
the O
future O
embryo O
body O
and O
extraembryonic O
membranes, O
or O
a O
trophectoderm O
(TE) O
that O
will O
create O
the O
embryonic O
part O
of O
placenta. O
Later, O
differentiation O
events O
occur O
inside O
the O
ICM O
itself, O
with O
specification O
of O
EPI O
and O
primitive O
endoderm O
(PE) O
lineages. O
EPI O
gives O
rise O
to O
the O
embryo O
proper O
together O
with O
extraembryonic O
membranes, O
including O
the O
allantois O
and O
amnion, O
and O
PE O
gives O
rise O
to O
the O
endodermal O
layer O
of O
the O
yolk O
sac. O

a O

O O

(Fig. O

(Fang O

TRs O
Rv0238 O
and O

belong O
to O
the O
TetR O

both O
regulate O

Interestingly, O

(Fig. O

(Rustad O

In O
contrast, O
the O

all O

(qRT-PCR) O
against O

performed, O
and O
the O

Comparing O
the O

for O
time O
points O
2 O
min O

8 O

However, O
the O

∆rssR O
showed O
a O
55.6-fold O
reduction O
(p O

clearly O
suggesting O
that O
RssR O
indeed O
slows O
down O
the O

the O

indicating O
a O

We O

detected O
an O
only O
4.05-fold O
reduction O
of O
the O

amount. O
Thus, O
the O
constitutive O
in O

RssR O
compensated O
the O
chromosomal O
lack O

and O
led O

As O
noted O
above, O
entomopathogenic O
fungi O
use O
specialized O
structures, O
termed O
appressoria, O
to O
break O
through O
the O
cuticular O
surfaces O
of O
their O
hosts O
and O
similar O
structures O
are O
found O
in O
phytopathogenic O
fungi. O
It O
is O
known O
that O
lipid O
droplets O
are O
required O
for O
appressorium O
function O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
the O
high O
turgor O
pressure O
that O
is O
required O
for O
virulence O
[ O

, O

]. O
In O
both O
the O
rice O
blast O
fungus, O
Magnaporthe O
grisea O
[ O
111 O
], O
and O
the O
insect O
pathogen, O
Metarhizium O
anisopliae O
[ O

], O
lipid O
droplets O
originate O
in O
fungal O
spores O
and O
redistribute O
to O
the O
incipient O
appressorium. O
Lipid O
droplets O
also O
play O
roles O
in O
colonization O
and O
sexual O
development O
in O
other O
fungi O
including O
the O
wheat O
pathogen, O
Fusarium O
graminearum O
[ O

and O
Aspergillus B-PATH
nidulans I-PATH
[ O
113 O
], O
which O
is O
both O
a O
soil-dwelling O
fungus O
and O
opportunistic O
human O
pathogen. O
Interestingly, O
in O
the O
widely O
studied O
Saccharomycetes O
class, O
only O
one O
out O
of O
the O
48 O
sequenced O
species O
contains O
CLO/PXG O
genes. O
Therefore, O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
are O
absent O
from O
such O
important O
experimental O
species O
as O
brewers’ O
yeast, O
Candida O
spp. O
and O
Pichia O

but O
are O
present O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
yeast, O
Lipomyces O
starkeyi O
(Additional O

However, O
when O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
from O
either O
fungi O
or O
plants O
are O
expressed O
in O
the O
normally O
CLO/PXG O
genes-deficient O
yeast, O
Saccharomyces O
cerevisiae, O
the O
genes O
are O
expressed O
and O
active O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
are O
produced, O
leading O
to O
increased O
accumulation O
of O
intracellular O
lipid O
droplets O
that O
harbour O
these O
proteins O
[ O
2 O
, O
47 O
]. O
Another O
interesting O
CLO/PXG-containing O
fungus O
is O
the O
basidiomycetous O
yeast, O
Rhodosporidium O
toruloides, O
which O
has O
biotechnological O
uses O
as O
a O
producer O
of O
carotenes O
and O
triacylglycerols. O

In O
seeds O
and O
pollen O

CLO/PXGs O
have O
also O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
roles O
in O
lipid O
packaging O
and O
mobilization O
[ O
30 O
, O

]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
lipid O
peroxygenase O
activity O
of O
CLO/PXGs O
in O
plants O
is O
associated O
with O
epoxy O

In O
this O

we O

performed O
a O
systematic O

of O
the O

The O

However, O
the O

which O

the O

Although O
these O

important O
in O

our O
understanding O

clearly O
limited, O
and O
chlamydial O

may O
also O
be O
dependent O
on O
several O

Host-associated O
factors, O
such O

coinfection O

(such O
as O

and O
the O

have O
also O
been O
suggested O
as O
drivers O
of O
chlamydial O

in O

that O

Taken O

we O

to O
the O

of O
the O

by O

of O
the O

of O
the O

RssR O
is O
probably O
an O
extrinsic O
RNA O
as O
it O
regulates O
the O
translation O
of O
a O

Our O

also O

that O
the O

may O
control O

via O
increasing O
the O

and O
possibly O
triggers O
the O
activation O
of O
this O

during O

In O
effect, O
strict O
adherence O
towards O
the O
recommended O
decontamination O
practices O
by O
all O
healthcare O
workers O
is O
critical. O
Thus, O
this O
study O
aimed O
to O
assess O
the O
decontamination O
practice O
and O
associated O
factors O
among O
nurses O
working O
in O
Bale O

hospitals. O
This O
study O
showed O
that O
only O
49.1% O
of O
the O

participates O
had O
acceptable O
decontamination O
practice. O
In O
multivariable O

and O
working O
in O

having O
instructive O

or O

on O

were O
significantly O
associated O
with O
acceptable O
decontamination O
practice. O
The O
finding O
implies O
that O
half O
of O
the O
study O
participants O
have O
unacceptable O
decontamination O
practice, O
which O
has O
been O
attributed O
as O
a O
potential O
problem O
in O
the O
fight O
against O
pathogenic O
microorganisms. O
This O
finding O
also O
comparable O
with O
other O
previous O
studies O
that O
reported O
a O
high O
prevalence O
of O
unsafe O
medical O

among O
healthcare O
workers O
[ O
10 O
, O
16 O
]. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
77.3% O
of O
nurses O
reported O
they O
soak O
contaminated O
items O
in O
0.5% O
chlorine O

before O
they O
perform O
any O
cleaning O
activity. O
And, O
77.2% O
soaked O
within O
the O
acceptable O
time O
range. O
This O
finding O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
national O
infection O
prevention O
guideline O
recommendation O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Despite O
a O
strong O
theoretical O
basis O
and O
national O
recommendation O
to O
use O
appropriate O
personal O
protective O
equipment O
while O
performing O
decontamination O
activities O
only O
one O
out O
of O
five O
nurse O
use O
google/eye O
shield O
and O
29.1% O
use O

while O
performing O
decontamination. O
This O
finding O
almost O
in O
agreement O
with O
a O
study O
conducted O
in O
Addis O
Ababa O
health O
centers; O
revealed O
that O
the O
level O
of O
personal O
protective O
equipment O
utilization O
while O
performing O
instrument O
processing O
was O
22.6% O
[ O
10 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
nurses O
reported O
having O
good O
infection O
prevention O

were O
almost O
seven O
times O
more O
likely O

than O
there O
counterpart. O
This O
association O
may O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
those O
with O
good O

were O
exposed O
to O

Despite O
these O
limitations, O
the O
low O
cost O
and O
high-throughput O
potential O
of O
this O
technique O
make O
it O
the O
most O
commonly O
used O
for O
initial O
descriptive O
data. O
Metagenomic O
shotgun O
sequencing O
generates O
short O
reads O
representing O
the O
whole O
genomic O
content O
within O
an O
environmental O
sample O
and O
is O
considered O
less O
biased O
than O
16S O
rRNA O
gene O
amplicon O
sequencing, O
because O
it O
does O
not O
contain O
a O
PCR O
amplification O
step. O
However, O
this O
can O
result O
in O
contamination O
with O
human O
genomic O
DNA O
and O
requires O
higher O
sequence O
coverage O
to O
detect O
bacterial O
species O
of O
low O
abundance. O
This O
necessitates O
additional O
data O
storage, O
computing O
power, O
and O
more O
sophisticated O
analysis O
pipelines. O
Errors O
can O
also O
be O
introduced O
in O
the O
downstream O
analysis O
at O
the O
step O
of O
genome O
assembly O
or O
gene O
prediction O
[ O

]. O
Various O
bioinformatic O
tools O
have O
been O
developed O
for O
metagenome O
assembly, O
and O
databases O
have O
been O
established O
for O
gene O
prediction, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
consensus O
on O
the O
best O
strategy O
[ O
40 O
]. O
Compared O
to O
16S O
rRNA O
gene O
amplicon O
sequencing, O
superior O
resolution O
down O
to O
species O
and O
strain O
level O
identity O
is O
feasible O
with O
shotgun O
sequencing O
because O
multiple O
marker O
gene O
sequences O
are O
used O
for O
taxonomic O
annotation O
[ O
37 O
]. O
This O
approach O
can O
also O
be O
used O
to O
characterize O
non-bacterial O
compartments O
of O
the O
commensal O
microbiota, O
including O
archaea, O
fungi O
or O
viruses. O
Another O
advantage O
of O
shotgun O
sequencing O
is O
that O
it O
can O
be O
used O
for O
characterization O
of O
the O
functional O
capacity O
encoded O
by O
the O
microbiome O
using O
gene O
prediction O
tools O
and O
databases O
[ O

]. O
By O
contrast, O
functional O
capacity O
can O
only O
be O
inferred O
indirectly O
from O
16S O
rRNA O
amplicon O
sequencing O
data O
[ O
41 O
– O
43 O
]. O
Each O
of O
these O
sequencing O
methods O
has O
its O
limitations, O
but O
the O
two O
can O
be O
integrated O
to O
improve O
the O
accuracy O
of O
bacterial O

Rarely, O

is O
eosinophilia O

However, O
RSV O

in O
combination O
with O
Ova O

resulted O
in O
significant O
pulmonary O

in O

who O
reported O

Although O
the O

for O
this O
discrepancy O
is O
unknown, O
there O
are O
several O
methodological O
differences O
between O
our O
studies, O
which O
may O
be O
pertinent. O
Peebles O
and O
colleagues: O
1) O
used O
adult O
mice O
in O
their O
studies, O
2) O
exposed O
their O
mice O
to O
daily O
Ova O
aerosol O
challenges O
for O
eight O
days, O
and O
3) O
infected O
their O
mice O
14 O
days O
post O
Ova O
challenge. O
Whereas O
we: O
1) O
used O
weanling O
mice, O
2) O
exposed O
mice O
to O
aerosolized O
Ova O
for O
20 O
min O
for O
three O
consecutive O
days, O
and O
3) O
infected O
our O
mice O
prior O
to O
Ova O
sensitization O
(ROO) O
or O
immediately O
following O
the O
last O
Ova O
challenge O
(OOR). O
Although O
the O
enhanced O
recruitment O
of O
any O
one O
cell O
did O
not O
correlate O
with O
pulmonary O
pathologies, O
the O
ratio O
of O
total O
macrophages O
to O
eosinophils O
in O
the O
BAL O
fluid O
correlated O
fairly O
well O
with O
pathophysiology O
(OVA: O

vs. O
OOR: O

Culley O
and O

in O
their O

[ O

demonstrated O
that O
RSV O

produced O
more O

did O

Here O
we O

We O
were O
not O
able O
to O
further O
identify O
the O

which O
had O
either O
a O
blue O
core O
(not O

or O
a O
throughout O
brown O

(all O
CD45 O

It O
might O
be O
speculated O
that O
these O
cells O
with O
an O
obviously O
a O
hematopoietic O
origin O
(from O
Ly5.1 O
CD45 O

mice), O
were O
de-differentiated O

The O

grafts O
must O
have O
attracted O
these O
kind O
of O
cells O
to O
the O
repair O
site O
by O
paracrine O
function, O
because O
ASCs O
do O
not O
remain O
for O
8 O
weeks O
at O
the O
site O
of O
action, O
but O
are O
usually O
washed O
out O
earlier. O
It O
was O
reported O
that O
ASC-seeded O
polysiloxane/collagen O
scaffolds O
did O
not O
have O
any O
ASCs O
left O
on O
the O
scaffold O
after O
a O
30-day O

59 O
. O
Therapeutic O
approaches O
based O
on O
ASCs O
can O
affect O
lung O
inflammation. O
COPD, O
the O
chronic O
obstructive O
pulmonary O
disease, O
was O
induced O
in O
a O
pig O
model O
with O
smoke O
from O
cigarettes. O
ASC O
therapy O
decreased O
tracheal O
hyper-responsiveness O
and O
lung O
inflammation O
58 O
. O
The O
paracrine O
effect O
of O
ASCs O
observed O
as O
suppressed O
allergic O
airway O
inflammation O
has O
been O
attributed O
to O
PGE O
2 O
(prostaglandin O
E2) O
and O
TGF-β O
(transforming O
growth O
factor O
beta), O
both O
secreted O
by O
ASCs O
60 O
. O
Furthermore, O
ASCs O
not O
only O
decreased O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
white O
adipose O
tissue O
of O
a O
mouse O
model, O
but O
also O
led O
to O
a O
switch O
of O
M1 O
to O
M2 O
macrophages O
by O
paracrine O
function O
61 O
, O
62 O
. O
It O
is O
therefore O
not O
surprising O
that O
ASCs O
that O
were O
applied O
in O
an O
inflammation O
model O
of O
rats O
suppressed O
pro- O
and O
enhanced O
anti-inflammatory O

63 O
. O
Although O
all O
these O
examples O
show O
a O
positive O
effect O
in O
terms O
of O
restricting O
inflammatory O
response, O
we O
found O
a O
slightly O
higher O
inflammatory O
reaction O
towards O
our O
novel O

we O

A O
detailed O

revealed O
several O

Thus, O
the O
genomes O
of O
four O
L. O

strains O
(IIA, O

three O

Another O

Because O

Viability O
of O

Since O
vancomycin O

an O

we O
tested O
the O

The O

to O

at O
a O

whereas O
the O

We O
also O

No O

The O

The O
present O
study O
showed O
that O
CRKP O
strains O
were O
rare O
in O
the O
CA O
group, O
but O
more O
prevalent O
in O
both O
HCA O

nosocomial O
groups. O
Thus, O
it O
should O
be O
of O
caution O
when O
use O
carbapenems O
to O
treat O
patients O
with O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O

In O
agreement O
with O
other O

the O

KPC O
was O
the O
dominant O
carbapenemase O
gene O
carried O
by O
CRKP O
strains O
[ O
18 O
, O
29 O
]. O
In O
this O
investigation, O
only O
12 O
and O
3 O
CRKP O
strains O
harbored O
bla O
NDM O
and O
bla O
OXA-48-like O
genes O
respectively. O
Indeed, O
the O
bla O
OXA-48-like O
producers O
were O
more O
prevalent O
in O
western O

such O
as O
France, O

but O
were O
rare O
in O
China O
[ O

]. O
In O
addition, O
the O

screened O
were O
absent O
in O
five O

(data O

indicating O
other O

may O

The O
remaining O
four O
CRKP O

have O
other O

in O

can O
be O
associated O
with O

[ O
33 O
, O
34 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
overexpression O
of O
efflux O

in O
strains O
may O
also O
lead O
to O
carbapenem O
resistance. O
However, O
both O

were O
present O
in O
the O
other O
four O

in O
this O

(data O

Further O

assess O
the O

of O
the O

This O

showed O
that O

This O

the O

as O
to O
whether O
CLO/PXG O

were/are O
also O

we O
were O
only O

find O
putative O

in O
three O
of O

We O
have O

Furthermore, O
we O

such O
as O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
information O
in O
this O
mini-review O
will O
aid O
in O
assessing O
whether O

Mtb O

The O
4.4 O
Mb O
genome O
of O
Mtb O
H37Rv O
contains O
twenty O
CYP O
genes O
(Cole O
et O
al. O
1998 O
). O
This O
is O
a O
relatively O
high O
number O
for O
prokaryotes, O
as O
most O
sequenced O
bacterial O
genomes O
generally O
contain O
a O
small O
number O
of O
CYP O
genes. O
The O
high O
abundance O
of O
CYP O
genes O
is O
a O
general O
characteristic O
of O
mycobacteria O
exemplified O
by O
Mycobacterium O
rhodesiae O

(70), O
Mycobacterium O

(25) O
as O
compiled O
by O
Parvez O

( O

). O
In O
contrast, O
Mycobacterium O

has O
lost O
all O

one O
functional O
CYP O
protein, O
encoded O
by O
ML2088c O
(37% O

However, O
this O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O

Deciphering O

Yet, O
despite O
the O
high O
abundance O
of O
CYP O

in O
mycobacteria, O
phylogenetic O

shown O
that O

Furthermore, O
the O

require O
a O

In O

In O
cases O
where O
the O
feral O
population O
is O
sufficiently O
isolated O
from O
managed O
colonies, O
this O
can O
lead O
to O
resistance O
(e.g. O
Seeley O
2007 O
; O
Le O
Conte O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
Often O
swarms O
from O
managed O
colonies, O
which O
become O
feral, O
soon O
die O
(Thompson O
et O
al. O
2014 O
), O
probably O
because O
those O
colonies O
do O
not O
possess O
genes O
enabling O
survival O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
mite O
treatments. O
However, O
swarms O
from O
the O
naturally O
selected O
population O
will O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
survive O
because O
they O
have O
acquired O
resilience O
to O
V. O

Darwin’s O
Black O
Bee O
Box O
might O
therefore O
shift O
the O
balance O
between O
managed O
and O
feral O
colonies O
by O
increasing O
the O
chances O
for O
survival O
and O
re-establishment O
of O

populations. O
DBBB O
may O
help O
the O
invasion O
of O
Varroa O
destructor O
to O
become O
a O
successful O
naturalization O
After O
an O
invasive O
species O
has O
established, O
the O
preferred O
and O
chosen O
path O
of O
targeted O
management, O
including O
control/mitigation, O
may O
become O
more O
costly O
and O
troublesome O
than O
accepting O
the O
inevitable O
fate O
that O
the O
species O
has O
become O
‘ours’ O
(Epstein O
2017 O
). O
However, O
being O
established O
also O
implies O
that O
the O
invasive O
species O
has O
become O
part O
of O
‘our’ O
nature, O
which O
also O
opens O
the O
challenge O
for O
the O
invasive O
species O
to O
adapt O
and O
fit O
in O
a O
new O
niche O
as O
a O
naturalized O
species O
(Blackburn O
et O
al. O
2011 O
). O
For O
the O
established O
invasive O
species O
V. O
destructor, O
we O
propose O
to O
gradually O
abandon O
targeted O
management O
measures O
and O
hand O
the O
initiative O
over O
to O
natural O
selection. O
We O
therefore O
call O
upon O
beekeepers O
and O
scholars O
to O
follow O
our O
Darwin’s O
Black O
Bee O
Box O
trials, O
to O
be O
started O
now O
and O
in O
the O
years O
to O
come. O
DBBB O
might O
work O
for O
other O
invasive O
parasitic O
species O
too O
Since O
evolution O
by O
natural O
selection O
is O
universal O
for O
all O
species, O
it O
seems O
evident O
that O
this O
type O
of O
approach O
could O
in O
principle O
be O
used O
for O
other O
invasive O
species O
as O
well O
(e.g. O
for O

Guzman O

Indeed, O
in O
many O
cases O
invasive O
parasite O

controlled O
by O

as O
its O

It O
used O
to O
be O
supposed O
that O
there O
were O
two O
types O

and O
type-2. O
However, O
the O
idea O
that O

might O
be O
type-3 O
diabetes O
was O
proposed O
ten O
years O
ago O
(Martins O
et O

). O
Some O
studies O
suggested O
that O
AD O
progresses O
because O
of O
the O
brain O
developing O
resistance O
to O
insulin, O
which O
in O

prevents O
proper O

Over O

these O

build O
up O

rather O
than O

which O
results O
in O

CYPs O
are O
haem-containing O
monooxygenase O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
lipid O
and O
steroid O
metabolism O
in O
eukaryotes. O
In O
fungi, O
several O
CYPs O
are O
already O
validated O
drug O
targets. O
An O
example O
is O
CYP51, O
the O
fungal O
sterol-14α-demethylase O
involved O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
membrane O
sterols. O
CYP51 O
can O
be O
inhibited O
by O
several O
azole-compounds O
(Warrilow O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
The O
use O
of O
anti-fungal O
azoles O
to O
inhibit O
CYP51 O
has O
also O
been O
proposed O
as O
treatment O
for O
parasitic O
infections, O
such O
as O
Chagas O
disease O
and O
the O
African O
sleeping O

(Lepesheva O
et O
al. O
2008 O
; O
Chen O
et O

2010 O
). O
A O
homolog O
of O
CYP51 O
is O
also O
encoded O
in O
Mtb O
genome, O
cyp51b1, O
highlighting O
its O
potential O
use O
as O
a O
drug O
target. O
Interestingly, O
CYP-inhibiting O
azole O
drugs O
have O
potent O
anti-mycobacterial O
activity O
and O
econazole O
reduced O
bacterial O
burden O
by O
90% O
in O
the O
lungs O
and O
spleen O
of O
mice O
infected O
with O
Mtb O
(Guardiola-Diaz O

; O
Ahmad O
et O

2006a O
, O

; O
McLean O
et O
al. O
2006a O
). O
However, O
it O
remains O
unclear O
whether O
the O
growth O
inhibition O
was O
due O
to O
inhibition O
of O
one O
or O
more O
Mtb O
CYPs O
by O
econazole O
(Ahmad O
et O

). O
In O

of O
the O
potential O

of O
CYPs O
in O
physiology O
and O
pathology, O
as O

as O

in-depth O
understanding O
of O
the O
physiological O

of O
these O

is O
a O
priority. O
In O
this O

we O
update O
the O
current O
knowledge O
on O
the O
essentiality O
and O
physiological O
function O
of O
Mtb O
CYPs O
and O
their O
cognate O

which O
has O

For O
example, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
basal O
species, O
Rozella O

three O
of O
the O
five O
major O
CLO/PXG O
motifs O
appear O
to O
be O
missing O
according O
to O
MEME O
(final O
line O
in O
Fig. O

), O
but O
manual O
inspection O
shows O
that O
the O
‘missing’ O
motifs O
2, O
4 O
and O
5 O
are O
essentially O
present, O
albeit O
in O
somewhat O
modified O
form O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
fungal O
sequences. O
Despite O
extensive O
trials, O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
find O
any O
better O
motif O
prediction O
software O
than O
MEME O
for O
this O
particular O
analysis O
but O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
even O
MEME O
is O
not O
always O
fully O
reliable. O
Nevertheless, O
the O
method O
is O
still O
useful O
for O
a O
broad-brush O
analysis O
of O
large O
numbers O
of O
sequences, O
with O
the O
proviso O
that O
manual O
curation O
is O
still O
required O
for O
more O
accurate O
results. O
One O
example O
of O
a O
useful O
prediction O
from O
MEME O
was O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O
sixth O
motif, O
labelled O
6 O
in O
Fig. O

and O
Additional O
file O
10 O
: O
Figure O
SI, O
that O
was O
located O
close O
to O
the O
N-terminus O
of O
the O
proteins. O
This O
motif O
(shaded O
green O
in O
the O
gene O
name O
column O
in O
the O
above O
Figures) O
was O
present O
in O
258 O
of O
the O
344 O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
sequences. O
Interestingly, O
fungal O
motif O
six O
was O
structurally O
similar O
to O
the O
N-terminal O
located O
motif O
4 O
that O
we O
previously O
found O
in O
Viridiplantae O
sequences O
[ O
4 O
]. O
This O
motif O
is O
also O
referred O
to O
in O
the O
literature O
as O
the O
‘H-domain’, O
which O
in O
plants O
is O
a O
30–50-residue O
sequence O
that O
is O
found O
in O
most O
CLO/PXG O
isoforms O
in O
some O
algae O
and O
more O
primitive O
land O
plants O
[ O
27 O
, O
29 O
, O
77 O
, O
78 O
]. O
In O
contrast, O
we O
found O
that O
in O
the O
much O
more O
recently O
evolved O
angiosperm O
phylum O
(also O
known O
as O
Angiospermae O
or O
Magnoliophya), O
which O
includes O
all O
flowering O
plants, O
every O
genome O
contained O
at O
least O
one O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
copy O
with O
an O
H-domain O
plus O
one O
copy O
where O
the O
H-domain O
was O
missing O
– O
the O
latter O
are O
termed O
L-domain O
isoforms O
because O
the O
proteins O
are O
3–5 O
kDa O
lighter O
than O
the O
corresponding O
H-domain O
isoforms O
[ O
4 O
]. O

This O
approach O
can O
also O
be O
used O
to O
characterize O
non-bacterial O
compartments O
of O
the O
commensal O
microbiota, O
including O
archaea, O
fungi O
or O
viruses. O
Another O
advantage O
of O
shotgun O
sequencing O
is O
that O
it O
can O
be O
used O
for O
characterization O
of O
the O
functional O
capacity O
encoded O
by O
the O
microbiome O
using O
gene O
prediction O
tools O
and O
databases O
[ O
40 O
]. O
By O
contrast, O
functional O
capacity O
can O
only O
be O
inferred O
indirectly O
from O
16S O
rRNA O
amplicon O
sequencing O
data O
[ O
41 O
– O
43 O
]. O
Each O
of O
these O
sequencing O
methods O
has O
its O
limitations, O
but O
the O
two O
can O
be O
integrated O
to O
improve O
the O
accuracy O
of O
bacterial O
identification O
and O
quantitation O
[ O

Impact O
of O
the O
commensal O
microbiota O
on O
immunity: O
insights O
from O
gnotobiotic O
mouse O
models O
The O
role O
of O
the O
commensal O
microbiota O
in O
modulating O
host O
physiology O
becomes O
particularly O
evident O
when O
conventionally O
raised O
specific O
pathogen-free O
(SPF) O
mice O
are O
compared O
to O
germ-free O
(GF, O
axenic) O
mice. O
GF O
mice O
are O
defined O
as O
devoid O
of O
detectable O
microbiota O
during O
their O
life. O
The O
term O
gnotobiotic O
pertains O
to O
animals O
with O
known O
(defined) O
microbiota O
composition O
and O
encompasses O
GF, O
as O
well O
as O
ex-GF O
animals O
colonized O
with O
defined O
microbial O
communities. O
The O
commensal O
microbiota O
broadly O
impacts O
host O
physiology, O
and O
this O
has O
been O
mainly O
shown O
in O
studies O
with O
GF O
mice, O
which O
have O
inefficient O
energy O
extraction O
from O
the O
diet, O
abnormal O
fluid O
balance O
and O
electrolyte O
status, O
and O
disturbances O
in O
liver, O
lung, O
cardiovascular O
system, O
endocrine O
organ, O
nervous O
system, O
and O
immune O
system O
functions O
[ O
45 O
, O

]. O
Impact O
on O
local O
immunity O
The O
gut O
microbiota O
is O
intimately O
involved O
in O
the O
development O
and O
regulation O
of O
the O
immune O
system, O
especially O
with O
respect O
to O
local O
mucosal O
immunity. O
This O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
GF O
mice, O
which O
show O
deficiencies O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
immune O
compartment O
rendering O
them O
more O
susceptible O
to O
infections. O
However, O
such O
deficiencies O
can O
be O
corrected O
by O
colonization O
with O
commensal O
bacteria. O
For O
instance, O
in O
GF O
mice, O
the O
mucus-producing O
goblet O
cells O
are O
fewer O
and O
smaller. O

To O
date, O
genomic O
sequences O
of O
132 O
L. O
casei O
and O
L. O
paracasei O
strains O
are O
publicly O
available, O
25 O
of O
which O
are O
complete O
( O

The O
IBB3423 O
strain O
shows O
genomic O
features, O
not O
unlike O
those O
of O
other O
L. O
casei/paracasei O
strains O
as O
concerns O
the O
GC O
content O
(46.3%) O
and O
genome O
size. O
Notably, O
its O
chromosome O
of O
ca. O
3 O
Mbp O
is O
the O
second O
largest O
among O
L. O
casei/paracasei. O
Also, O
the O
presence O
of O
two O
plasmids O
and O
their O
size O
(5986 O
bp O
and O
51,211 O
bp) O
are O
typical O
for O
this O
group O
of O
bacteria. O
Previous O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
strains O
of O
L. O
paracasei O
harbor O
up O
to O
four O
(Desmond O
et O
al. O
2005 O
) O
or O
perhaps O
even O
six O
plasmids O
(Smokvina O
et O
al. O
2013 O
) O
of O
different O
sizes. O
However, O
a O
recently O
published O
article O
claimed O
that O
the O
L. O
paracasei O
DPC2071 O
strain O
may O
harbor O
up O
to O
eleven O
plasmids O
(Stefanovic O
and O
McAuliffe O
2018 O
). O
These O
mobile O
replicons O
often O
carry O
genes O
conferring O
competitive O
advantage O
for O
the O
bacterium O
or O
critical O
for O
the O
industrial O
application O
such O
as O
those O
encoding O
production O
of O
bacteriocins, O
resistance O
to O
antibiotics, O
heavy O
metals, O
and O
phages O
or O
enabling O
utilization O
of O
lactose O
(Wang O
and O
Lee O
1997 O
). O
However, O
among O
the O
plasmid-borne O
genes O
of O
L. O
paracasei, O
only O
some O
have O
a O
known O
function O
(Smokvina O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Also O
in O
the O
present O
study, O
many O
of O
the O
predicted O
proteins O
encoded O
by O
pLCAKO.1 O
and O
pLCAKO.2 O
plasmids O
were O
annotated O
as O
hypothetical O
(90% O
and O
45%, O
respectively). O
Among O
those O
of O
known O
function O
are O
the O
pLCAKO.2 O
genes O
for O
lactose O
metabolism O
and O
pilus O
formation, O
both O
features O
relevant O
to O
the O
possible O
application O
of O
IBB3423. O

(Belin O

). O
The O
physiological O
role O
of O
mycocyclosin O
for O
Mtb O
remains O
unknown. O
However, O
several O
cyclic O
dipeptides O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
bacterial O
physiology. O
For O
instance, O
the O
cyclo(Phe-Pro) O
inhibited O
the O
production O
of O
virulence O
factors O
in O
Vibrio O
cholerae O
(Park O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
McLean O
et O
al. O
2008 O
, O
2010 O
). O
CYP121A1 O
is O
considered O
a O
highly O
selective O
CYP, O
since O
it O
does O
not O
efficiently O
metabolize O
any O
cYY O
analogs O
(Fonvielle O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Spectroscopic O
characterization O
of O
recombinant O
CYP121A1 O
showed O
the O
same O
P450 O
collapse O
of O
the O
CO-ferrous O
state O
as O
previously O
described O
for O
CYP51B1. O
However, O
this O
event O
was O
reversible O
at O
lower O
pH, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
state O
was O
dependent O
on O
the O
protonation O
of O
the O
cysteine O
thiolate O
(Cys345) O
to O
thiol O
(Dunford O

Functional O

possible O

of O
which O
only O
41 O
showed O
relatively O
high O

to O
other O
hypothetical O
proteins. O
The O
other O
47 O
(53.4%) O
ORFs O
could O
not O
be O
annotated, O
indicating O
that O
φAbp2 O
is O
a O
unique O
phage. O
Moreover, O
the O
lack O
of O
clarity O
about O
the O
function O
of O
many O
of O
the O
genes O
creates O
obstacles O
to O
broadening O
the O
narrow O
host O
spectrum O
of O
this O
bacteriophage. O
Previous O
studies O
have O
identified O
host-range O
determinants O
such O
as O
gp17 O
in O
T7 O
phage O
and O
gp37 O
and O
gp3 O
in O
T4-like O
phages O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
], O
but O
none O
of O
the O
currently O
known O
host O
range O
determinants O
showed O
similarity O
to O
the O
ORFs O
of O
φAbp2, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
unannotated O
ORFs O
might O
hold O
the O
key O
to O
the O
specific O
host O
range O
characteristics O
of O
φAbp2. O
The O
putative O
foreign O
genes O
of O
φAbp2 O
(ORF46, O
48, O
80, O
and O
87) O
showed O
a O
degree O
of O
similarity O
to O
genes O
of O
non-microbial O
organisms O
suggesting O
that O
this O
phage O
can O
carry O
foreign O
genes O
and O
possibly O
even O
human O
genes. O
It O
is O
proposed O
that O
φAbp2 O
may O
interact O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
with O
these O
organisms, O
since O
phages O
might O
acquire O
foreign O
genes O
to O
allow O
them O
to O
produce O
soluble O
factors O
[ O
23 O
]. O
To O
determine O
whether O
phage O
φAbp2 O
might O
be O
temperate, O
we O
searched O
for O
lysogenic O
phage O
genes, O
but O
found O
only O
one O
possible O
lysogenic O
gene O
(ORF30). O
Although O
no O
known O
lysogenic O
factors, O
including O
excisionase O
or O
anti-repressor O
proteins O
[ O
24 O
], O
were O
found O
during O
the O
genome O
annotation O
of O
φAbp2, O
the O
predicted O
proteins O
with O
unknown O
functions O
might O
nevertheless O
have O
lysogen-related O
functions. O
The O
presence O
of O
ORFs O
(ORF46 O
and O
80) O
with O
similarity O
to O
two O
genes O
of O
Homo O
sapiens O
suggests O
that O
these O
genes O
might O
have O
been O
acquired O
from O
humans. O
The O
application O
of O
φAbp2 O
to O
humans O
might O
lead O
to O
complications, O
including O
immune O
effects, O
as O
phages O
have O
been O
shown O
recently O
to O
interact O
directly O
with O
somatic O

Introduction O
Of O
the O
various O
types O
of O
hemophilia, O
hemophilia O
A O
and O
hemophilia O
B O
are O
genetic O
disorders O
caused O
by O
coagulation O
factor O
deficiencies O
of O
factor O
VIII O
and O
factor O
IX, O
respectively. O
As O
hemophilia O
A O
and O
B O
are O
X-linked O
recessive O
disorders, O
it O
mainly O
affects O
males O
1 O
. O
The O
most O
widely O
used O
hemophilia O
classification O
is O
based O
on O
deceased O
factors O
clotting O
activity, O
with O
persons O
&gt;5% O
factors, O
as O
mild O
hemophilia, O
with O
persons O
1–5%, O
as O
moderate O
hemophilia O
and O
with O
persons O
&lt;1% O
factor, O
as O
severe O
hemophilia O
2 O
. O
The O
lower O
the O
clotting O
factor O
activity O
level, O
the O
more O
frequent O
spontaneous O
bleeding O
episodes O
happen. O
The O
incidence O
of O
hemophilia O
A O
is O
approximately O
1:5000 O
male O
births, O
whereas O
the O
incidence O
of O
hemophilia O
B O
is O
1:30,000 O
male O
births, O
although O
reports O
vary O
widely O
between O
countries O
3 O
. O
After O
many O
years O
of O
conflict O
and O
political O
instability, O
Afghanistan’s O
health O
system O
remains O
among O
the O
very O
poorest O
in O
the O
world. O
Therefore, O
there O
are O
no O
accurate O
reports O
of O
the O
incidence O
of O
hemophilia O
in O
this O
country. O
Modern O
treatment O
for O
hemophilia O
bleeding O
disorder O
started O
in O
the O
1970s, O
with O
the O
wide O
availability O
of O
safe O
plasma-derived O
coagulation O
factors O
and O
widespread O
adoption O
of O
home-administered O
replacement O
therapy O
led O
to O
the O
early O
control O
of O
hemorrhages. O
The O
optimistic O
perception O
of O
hemophilia O
changed O
at O
a O
time O
when O
plasma-derived O
concentrates O
manufactured O
from O
pooled O
plasma O
obtained O
from O
thousands O
of O
donors O
were O
invariably O
contaminated O
with O
hepatitis O
B, O
C O
virus O
and O
HIV O
and O
many O
patients O
exposed O
became O
infected O
4 O
. O
Consequent O
to O
widespread O
blood-borne O
virus O
transmission, O
the O
need O
for O
improved O
safety O
of O
treatment O
became O
crucial O
for O
the O
hemophilia O
community. O
The O
most O
important O
advance O
in O
this O
field O
was O
represented O
by O
recombinant O
gene O
technology O
which O
enabled O
the O
highly O
purified O
development O
of O
recombinant O
coagulation O
factors. O

Evidence O
linking O
the O
gut O
microbiome O
to O
cancer O
immunotherapy O
Multiple O
studies O
support O
that O
gut O
microbes O
can O
profoundly O
influence O
the O
potency O
of O
immunotherapy O
and O
some O
chemotherapies O
with O
immunostimulatory O
functions O
(summarized O
in O
Table O
1 O
). O
Pioneering O
work O
in O
this O
field O
found O
that O
intestinal O
microbiota O
was O
essential O
for O
optimal O
responses O
to O
CpG-oligonucleotide O
immunotherapy O
which O
activates O
innate O
immune O
cells O
through O
TLR9 O
[ O
85 O
]. O
Similarly, O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
was O
found O
to O
shape O
the O
anti-cancer O
immune O
response O
by O
stimulating O
generation O
of O
a O
specific O
subset O
of O
“pathogenic” O
Th17 O
(pTh17) O
cells O
and O
memory O
Th1 O
immune O
response O
after O
treatment O
with O
immune-stimulatory O
chemotherapy O
cyclophosphamide O
[ O
86 O
]. O
Certain O
bacterial O
taxa O
in O
patients O
with O
hematologic O
malignancies O
are O
associated O
with O
efficacy O
of O
allogeneic O
hematopoietic O
stem O
cell O
transplantation O
(allo-HSCT) O
and O
decreased O
risk O
for O
graft-versus-host O
disease O
(GVHD) O
following O
therapy O
[ O
87 O
, O
88 O
]. O
Initial O
evidence O
for O
the O
contribution O
of O
specific O
microbes O
to O
immune O
checkpoint O
blockade O
(ICB) O
immunotherapy, O
including O
CTLA-4 O
and O
PD-1/PD-L1 O
blockade, O
was O
demonstrated O
in O
mouse O
models O
[ O
17 O
, O
18 O
]. O
B. O
fragilis O
was O
reported O
to O
enhance O
anti-CTLA-4 O
efficacy O
via O
a O
proposed O
mechanism O
involving O
the O
activation O
of O
Th1 O
cells O
with O
cross-reactivity O
to O
bacterial O
antigens O
and O
tumor O
neoantigens O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Oral O
administration O
of O
Bifidobacterium O
increased O
tumor O
infiltration O
and O
IFN-γ O
production O
by O
CD8 O
+ O
tumor-specific O
T O
cells O
and O
improved O
both O
basal O
tumor O
control O
and O
anti-PD-L1 O
efficacy O
via O
a O
proposed O
mechanism O
involving O
increased O
activation O
of O
splenic O
and O
intratumoral O
DCs O
[ O
17 O
]. O

Later, O
differentiation O
events O
occur O
inside O
the O
ICM O
itself, O
with O
specification O
of O
EPI O
and O
primitive O
endoderm O
(PE) O
lineages. O
EPI O
gives O
rise O
to O
the O
embryo O
proper O
together O
with O
extraembryonic O
membranes, O
including O
the O
allantois O
and O
amnion, O
and O
PE O
gives O
rise O
to O
the O
endodermal O
layer O
of O
the O
yolk O
sac. O
Many O
talks O
were O
also O
dedicated O
to O
other O
key O
developmental O
events, O
such O
as O
anterior-posterior O
(A-P) O
or O
dorsal-ventral O
(D-V) O
axis O
formation, O
gastrulation, O
or O
neurulation, O
both O
in O
mammals O
and O
non-mammalian O
species. O
The O
meeting O
was O
opened O
by O
Elizabeth O
Robertson O
(University O
of O
Oxford, O
UK), O
who O
discussed O
some O
of O
her O
seminal O
work O
on O
Nodal O
signalling O
in O
the O
segregation O
of O
embryonic O
and O
extraembryonic O
tissues O
in O
early O
post-implantation O
development O
of O
mouse O
embryos, O
including O
her O
exciting O
recent O
studies O
demonstrating O
that O
Smad2/3 O
are O
required O
to O
maintain O
distinct O
embryonic O
and O
extra-embryonic O
cell O
identity O
in O
the O
EPI, O
during O
lineage O
priming O
(Senft O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
Elizabeth’s O
talk O
also O
reinforced O
the O
insight O
that O
can O
be O
gained O
from O
using O
integrating O
different O
approaches, O
such O
as O
ATAC-seq O
(Nelson O
et O
al. O
2017 O
), O
embryonic O
stem O
cells, O
and O
knockouts O
(Senft O
et O
al. O
2018 O
), O
to O
understand O
fundamental O
biological O
questions; O
this O
set O
the O
scene O
for O
what O
was O
an O
on-going O
theme O
throughout O
the O
meeting. O
Several O
talks O
addressed O
the O
earliest O
stages O
of O
embryo O
linage O
specification; O
in O
particular, O
Miguel O
Manzanares O
(Centro O
National O
de O
Investigaciones O
Cardiovasculares, O
Spain) O
presented O
his O
results O
on O
role O
of O
Notch O
signalling O
in O
ICM O
vs. O
TE O
differentiation O
in O
mouse O
(Menchero O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
Takashi O
Hiiragi O
(European O
Molecular O
Biology O
Laboratory, O
Germany), O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
used O
mouse O
blastocysts O
displaying O
pulsatile O
shape O
changes O
as O
an O
experimental O
model O
to O
investigate O
the O
interplay O
between O
embryo O
size, O
TE O
biomechanical O
properties O
and O
TE O
functionality O
(Chan O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O

In O
our O
case, O
the O
use O
of O
oxalic O
acid O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
capped O
brood O
twice O
a O
year O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
sufficient O
control O
treatment O
(Panziera O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Feeding O
of O
the O
colonies O
Feeding O
colonies O
is O
obviously O
not O
natural. O
We O
know O
from O
the O
work O
of O
Seeley O
( O
1995 O
, O
2017 O
) O
that O
in O
the O
wild O
(here O
Arnot O
Forest), O
only O
23% O
of O
founder O
colonies O
from O
primary O
swarms O
that O
successfully O
occupy O
a O
nest O
cavity O
are O
able O
to O
survive O
the O
first O
winter. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
established O
colonies, O
the O
winter O
survival O
rate O
increases O
to O
84% O
(Seeley O
2017 O
). O
Starvation O
over O
winter O
may O
be O
the O
prime O
cause O
for O
not O
surviving O
of O
colonies O
in O
the O
wild. O
In O
comparison, O
&gt; O
95% O
of O
well O
managed O
bee O
colonies O
(= O
well O
fed O
and O
treated O
against O
V. O
destructor) O
in O
Germany O
survive O
winter O
(Genersch O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
In O
our O
scheme, O
we O
avoid O
an O
extra O
selection O
pressure O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
food O
by O
feeding O
the O
young O
colonies O
with O
sugar O
dough. O
In O
periods O
of O
poor O
forage, O
established O
colonies O
should O
also O
be O
fed. O
Minimum O
duration O
of O
4 O
years O
The O
program O
should O
run O
for O
at O
least O
4 O
years O
to O
see O
the O
first O
effects, O
and O
preferably O
be O
continued. O
The O
reason O
being O
that O
in O
a O
previous O
trial O
in O
the O
Netherlands O
we O
saw O
changes O
in O
V. O
destructor O
reproduction O
success O
in O
the O
non-treated O
colonies O
after O
4 O
years O
(Panziera O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
Kruitwagen O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Recent O
research O
of O
Avalos O
et O
al. O
( O
2017 O
) O
showed O
that O
evolution O
by O
passage O
through O
a O
selective O
bottleneck O
can O
be O
very O
fast O
indeed O
(only O
ten O
generations/years) O
in O
the O
highly O
polyandrous O
honey O
bee. O
Procedure O
and O
principles O
No O
control O
of O
V. O
destructor: O
in O
the O
DBBB O
selected O
colonies, O
the O
control O
of O

will O
be O
ceased O
after O
the O

summer. O
Ultimately, O

(possibly O

every O

being O
a O

Our O
results O
showed O
that O
this O

almost O
fully O
recovered O
the O

of O
the O

Moreover, O
the O

was O
largely O
restored O
when O
growing O
on O

In O

the O

So O
we O
set O
to O
clarify O
whether O
the O

could O
affect O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O

As O

did O
not O
produce O

we O
used O
mycelia O

Our O

showed O
that O
the O

completely O
failed O
to O
cause O

( O

consistent O
with O
the O
result O
of O

In O
this O

A O
recurrent O
criticism O
of O
psychology O
as O
a O
science O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
diversity. O
This O
lack O
of O
diversity O
refers O
not O
solely O
to O
the O
producers O
of O
psychological O
science O
(e.g. O
Adair O
et O
al. O
2002 O
; O
Bauserman O
1997 O
; O
Cole O
2006 O
) O
or O
to O
the O
topics O
studied O
(e.g. O
Berry O
2013 O
), O
but O
also O
to O
the O
samples O
that O
are O
used O
as O
the O
basis O
for O
drawing O
inferences. O
This O
criticism O
is O
recurrent O
and O
has O
been O
voiced O
approximately O
once O
a O
decade O
since O
around O
1965 O
(e.g. O
Arnett O
2008 O
; O
Gallander O

2001 O
; O
Graham O
1992 O

; O
Nielsen O

). O
Following O
a O
review O
of O
the O
participants O
in O
psychological O
studies, O
Schultz O
( O
1969 O
:218) O
wrote: O
‘The O
extremely O
small O
percentage O
of O
studies O
sampling O
the O
general O
adult O
population O
was O
particularly O
disturbing; O
none O
of O
the O
studies O
published O
in O
the O
Journal O
of O
Experimental O
Psychology O
during O
those O
years O
used O
a O
sample O
of O
the O
general O
population’. O
There O
is O
an O
indisputable O
geographical O
bias O
to O
the O
populations O
sampled O
by O
psychologists. O
For O
example, O
a O
review O
of O
articles O
published O
between O
2006 O
and O
2010 O
in O
the O
three O
experimental O
developmental O
psychology O
journals O
with O
the O
highest O
impact O
factors O
found O
that O
over O
90% O
of O
the O
research O
participants O
came O
from O
Australia, O
Canada, O
Europe, O
the O
USA, O
or O
New O
Zealand, O
while O
under O
3% O
of O
the O
participants O
in O
the O
research O
studies O
were O
from O
Africa, O
Asia, O
Central O
and O
South O
America O
and O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
Israel O
(Nielsen O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Similarly, O
in O
the O
flagship O
journal O
‘Journal O
of O
Personality O
and O
Social O
Psychology’, O
96% O
of O
the O
papers O
published O
in O
2012 O
were O
based O
on O
WEIRD O
samples O
(Kurzban O
2013 O
). O
Further, O
from O
its O
inception, O
psychology O
has O
relied O
heavily O
on O
undergraduate O
samples, O
a O
situation O
that O
has O
not O
changed O
substantially O
over O
time. O
For O
example, O
Gallander O
Wintre O
et O

( O
2001 O
) O
reviewed O
1179 O
articles O
spanning O
six O
journals O
across O
the O
different O
subdivisions O
of O
psychology O
and O
found O
68% O
of O
the O
samples O
to O
be O
student O
samples. O
They O
also O
found O
that, O
if O
anything, O
the O
reliance O
on O
student O
samples O
had O
increased O
between O
1975 O
and O
1995. O

Background O
Primary O
peritonitis O
is O
an O
acute O
infection O
of O
the O
peritoneum O
without O
an O
obvious O
causative O
source; O
it O
is O
uncommon O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
comorbid O
conditions, O
including O
immunosuppression, O
nephritic O
disease, O
or O
liver O
cirrhosis, O
particularly O
in O
healthy O
individuals O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Primary O
peritonitis O
can O
be O
caused O
by O
infection O
with O
Enterobacteriaceae O
(e.g., O
Escherichia B-PATH
coli, I-PATH
Klebsiella O
spp.), O
Streptococcus B-PATH
pneumonia, I-PATH
and O
Enterococcus O
spp.; O
however, O
it O
is O
rarely O
associated O
with O
Streptococcus B-PATH
pyogenes, I-PATH
which O
usually O
causes O
pharyngitis, O
erysipelas, O
and O
tonsillitis. O
Necrotizing O
fasciitis O
is O
a O
severe O
infection O
due O
to O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes, I-PATH
which O
has O
a O
high O
mortality. O
This O
infection O
generally O
occurs O
in O
the O
extremities O
around O
the O
gate O
of O
bacterial O
invasion O
in O
the O
skin O
such O
as O
trauma O
and O
surgical O
wound. O
It O
is O
very O
rare O
to O
develop O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
secondary O
to O
primary O
peritonitis O
by O
the O
same O
bacteria O
species. O
Recent O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
carrying O
mutations O
in O
covS O
gene O
can O
cause O
severe O
invasive O
infections. O
In O
this O
report, O
we O
describe O
the O
investigation O
and O
management O
of O
a O
55-year-old O
woman O
with O
primary O
peritonitis O
and O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
caused O
by O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
with O
a O
mutated O
covS. O
Case O

A O
previously O
healthy O
55-year-old O
woman O
entered O
a O
general O

complaining O
of O
lower O
abdominal O

and O
nausea. O
She O
was O
diagnosed O
with O

and O
received O
fluid O
rehydration O
therapy O
with O
1500 O
mL O
of O
hypotonic O
electrolyte O
solution O
per O
day, O
and O
intravenous O
acetaminophen O
was O
used O
for O
abdominal O
pain. O
Her O
nausea O
was O
improved O
after O
admission, O
so O
she O
did O
not O
take O
antiemetics. O
Her O
vital O

included O
a O

were O
all O
identified O
by O
fewer O
than O
10% O
of O
the O

However, O
these O
traits O
might O
be O
a O
priority O
for O
livestock O
producers, O
maltsters, O
millers, O
and O
other O
end-users. O
Several O
producers O
in O
the O
“Other” O
category O
specifically O
cited O
lodging O
as O
a O
problem O
that O
they O
hoped O
to O
have O
resolved O
by O
barley O
breeding. O
Significant O
diseases O
Producers O
were O
asked O
to O
name O
specific O
diseases O
that O
they O
identified O
as O
problems. O
The O
information O
collected O
can O
be O
used O
by O
breeders O
to O
select O
varieties O
that O
are O
resistant O
to O
specific O
diseases. O
Figure O
2 O
shows O
the O
diseases O
identified O
by O
producers. O
Nearly O
half O
(45%) O
said O
that O
they O
did O
not O
have O
any O
significant O
diseases O
that O
were O
a O
problem. O

For O
those O
that O
identified O
significant O
diseases, O
there O
were O
again O
distinct O
regional O
differences. O
The O
most O
common O
pathogen O
nationwide O
was O
stripe O
rust, O
which O
was O
also O
the O
most O
important O
disease O
in O
the O
North O
Central O
region. O
Producers O
in O
the O
region O
with O
the O
most O
disease O
pressure—the O
Northeast—named O
powdery O
mildew O
as O
the O
most O
important O
disease. O
However, O
this O
pathogen O
was O
not O
a O
problem O
in O
any O
other O
region. O
The O
most O
common O
disease O
identified O
in O
the O
Western O
region O
was O
barley O
yellow O
dwarf O
virus. O
Naked O
barley O
This O
research O
project O
is O
also O
interested O
in O
determining O
the O
potential O
interest O
organic O
farmers O
have O
in O
the O
adopting O
naked O
(free O
threshing) O
barley O
varieties. O
Nearly O
25% O
of O
the O
respondents O
had O
grown O
naked O
barley O
in O
the O
past O
three O
years. O
However, O
many O
indicated O
that O
they O
were O
unfamiliar O
with O
naked O
barley O
or O
had O
no O
experience O
with O
it. O
The O
producers O
reported O
smaller O
average O
plantings O
and O
considerably O
lower O
yields O
for O
naked O
barley. O
The O
average O
area O
planted O
to O
naked O
barley O
was O
9 O
ha, O
with O
an O
average O
yield O
of O
2283 O
kg/ha. O
The O
primary O
obstacle O
to O
planting O
more O
naked O
barley O
named O
by O
producers O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
seed. O
This O
was O
followed O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
winter O
hardiness, O
an O
insufficient O
premium O
over O
covered O
varieties, O
and O
insufficient O
storage O
capacity O
to O
keep O
varieties O
separate. O
Two O
producers O
who O
had O
grown O
naked O
barley O
in O
the O
past O
reported O
that O
not O
all O
the O
grains O
free-threshed O
and O
that O
some O
dehulling O
was O
required. O

that O

Because O
the O
presentation O

is O
precisely O
dependent O
on O
the O

during O

the O

accompanied O
by O

This O

Meanwhile, O
symbiotic O
glowing O
bacteria O
isolated O
from O
Heterorhabditis O
bacteriophora O
were O
included O
into O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus O
as O
Xenorhabdus O
luminescensens O
(Thomas O
and O
Poinar O
1979 O
). O
Therefore, O
up O
to O
1993, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
bacterial O
species O
in O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus, O
i.e. O
Xenorhabdus O
nematophila O
(type O
species) O
and O
Xenorhabdus O
luminesces, O
which O
comprised O
symbionts O
of O
Steinernema O
and O
Heterorhabditis O
nematodes, O
respectively O
(Akhurst O
1983 O
; O
Akhurst O
and O
Boemare O
1988 O
; O
Boemare O
and O
Akhurst O
1988 O
; O
Farmer O
et O
al. O
1989 O
). O
However, O
the O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
phenotypic O
and O
molecular O
traits O
between O
these O
two O
species O
resulted O
in O
the O
transfer O
of O
all O
Heterorhabditis O
nematode O
symbionts O
into O
a O
new O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
as O
Photorhabus O
luminescens O
(Boemare O
et O
al. O
1993 O
). O
Although O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus O
was O
found O
to O
be O
more O
homogenous O
than O
Photorhabdus, O
it O
quickly O
became O
relatively O
rich O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
number O
of O
species O
(Akhurst O
et O
al. O
1996 O
). O
At O
first, O
using O
a O
polyphasic O
approach, O
3 O
new O
species O
were O
described O
by O
elevating O
the O
X. O
nematophila O
subspecies O
to O
the O
species O
level, O
i.e. O
Xenorhabdus O
beddingi, O
Xenorhabdus O
poinarii, O
and O
Xenorhabdus O
bovienii O
(Akhurst O
1983 O
; O
Akhurst O
and O

). O

The O

from O

during O

Discussion O
and O
conclusions O
The O
organic O
producers O
surveyed O
and O
interviewed O
view O
barley O
as O
a O
valuable O
crop O
in O
their O
rotation, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
not O
always O
a O
profitable O
one. O
Economic O
rather O
than O
agronomic O
factors O
were O
considered O
the O
biggest O
barriers O
to O
the O
expanded O
production O
of O
barley. O
However, O
yield O
was O
by O
far O
the O
most O
important O
agronomic O
trait O
identified O
by O
growers, O
followed O
by O
disease O
resistance O
and O
competitiveness O
with O
weeds. O
Organic O
producers O
said O
that O
they O
would O
grow O
more O
barley O
if O
the O
price O
was O
higher O
and O
the O
profit O
margin O
was O
greater. O
The O
current O
shortage O
of O
organic O
feed O
in O
the O
USA O
is O
one O
driver O
of O
demand. O
While O
the O
feed O
market O
is O
the O
easiest O
to O
access O
in O
terms O
of O
available O
marketing O
and O
processing O
infrastructure, O
and O
has O
the O
lowest O
quality O
requirements, O
it O
offers O
a O
relatively O
low O
return. O
While O
organic O
farmers O
receive O
a O
premium O
over O
conventional, O
the O
premium O
is O
not O
always O
enough O
to O
cover O
their O
lower O
yields O
and O
higher O
unit O
costs O
of O
production. O
Farmers O
that O
were O
interviewed O
indicated O
that O
food O
and O
malt O
processors O
were O
not O
paying O
a O
premium O
that O
justified O
the O
additional O
costs O
of O
growing O
for O
those O
markets O
compared O
with O
feed. O
Organic O
barley O
grown O
for O
malt O
or O
food O
is O
almost O
always O
contracted O
in O
advance O
rather O
than O
planted O
on O
speculation. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
there O
is O
a O
ready O
market O
for O
barley O
as O
feed, O
even O
in O
the O
case O
where O
it O
was O
grown O
as O
food O
or O
malting O
barley O
and O
does O
not O
meet O
quality O
specifications. O
The O
expansion O
of O
the O
organic O
malting O
and O
food O
barley O
markets O
can O
be O
served O
by O
the O
development O
of O
varieties O
with O
qualities O
better O
suited O
for O
organic O
farming O
conditions. O
The O
farmers O
interviewed O
indicated O
that O
to O
grow O
for O
these O
higher O
value O
markets, O
they O
would O
need O
to O
receive O
a O
premium O
over O
the O
organic O
feed O
price. O
Most O
farmers O
surveyed O
and O
interviewed O
were O
supportive O
of O
the O
development O
of O
multi-use O
naked O
barley O
varieties. O
Farmers O
interviewed O
demonstrated O
that O
barley O
can O
play O
several O
different O
roles O
in O
organic O
farming O
systems. O

Introduction O
Children O
born O

to O
have O
a O
shorter O
delay O
of O
occurrence O
of O
the O
first O
malaria O
infection O
1 O
– O
4 O
. O
This O
phenomenon O
is O
referred O
as O
immune O
tolerance O
(IT) O
that O
may O
be O
due O
to O
modifications O
of O
the O
newborn O
immune O
system O
development O
involving O
at O
least O
some O
cytokines O
production O
in O
cord O
blood O
5 O
. O
These O
modifications O
may O
induce O
differential O
immune O
responses O
involving O
IL10 O
and O
Interferon-γ O
during O
infancy O
6 O
. O
A O
similar O
phenomenon O
was O
described O
in O
cases O
of O
filariasis O
infection O
during O
pregnancy O
7 O
, O
8 O
. O
It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
children O
born O
to O
mothers O
with O
PM O
were O
also O
at O
an O
increased O
risk O
for O
non-malarial O
fever O
9 O
. O
Moreover, O
a O
recent O
result O
shows O
that O
children O
born O
to O
mothers O
with O
PM O
tend O
to O
have O
an O
increased O
risk O
for O
the O
first O
malaria O
attack O
but O
not O
for O
subsequent O
ones O
10 O
. O
These O
observations O
highlight O
that O
it O
is O
a O
very O
complex O
phenomenon O
that O
could O
imply O
immunity O
to O
a O
broader O
sense, O
not O
specific O
to O
malaria O
infection O
and O
not O
only O
related O
to O
PM O
infection. O

To O
test O
this O
hypothesis, O
FLAG-tagged O
versions O
of O
the O
wild-type O

(R103H) O
forms O

in O

Whole O

using O
an O
anti-FLAG O

and O
analyzed O
by O
label-free O

were O

were O
normalized O
by O
the O
pulled-down O
levels O
of O
the O

(POLR3B) O
in O
each O

We O
observed O
that O
the O
POLR3B O
R103H O
mutation O
greatly O
impedes O
the O
assembly O
or O
stability O
of O
the O
Pol O

complex. O
Indeed, O
eleven O
of O
the O
sixteen O
remaining O
Pol O

subunits O
were O
detected O
in O
pulldowns O
that O
used O
tagged O

POLR3B O
whereas O
lower O
amounts O
of O
each O
of O
these O
subunits O
relative O
to O
WT O
were O
pulled O
down O
using O
POLR3B O
R103H O
(Fig. O

a, O
Additional O
File O

: O

The O
ratio O
of O
six O
of O
these O
subunits O
showed O
a O
statistically O
significant O
reduction O
in O
the O
mutant O
purifications O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
the O
WT O
(Fig. O

implying O
a O
lower O
affinity O
of O
the O
mutant O
POLR3B O
subunit O
for O
its O
partners O
in O

and O
a O
decreased O
abundance O
of O
the O
mutant O

complex. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
in O
homozygous O
mouse O
cells, O
the O
defective O
Pol O

biogenesis O
conferred O
by O
the O
mutant O
POLR3B O
subunit O
may O
underlie O
the O

Importantly, O
when O
combined O
with O

[ O

our O

suggest O
that O
mutations O
causing O
a O
milder O

on O

function, O
such O
as O
POLR3A O
G672E, O
may O
not O
lead O

perhaps O
because O
of O

is O
the O

that O

be O
strongly O
reduced O
by O
the O
deletion O

during O

might O
serve O
as O
an O

During O
growth O
on O
solid O
MM O

with O

strain O

exhibits O
a O

however, O
this O

is O
absent O
in O
iolR-negative O

and O
in O
the O

The O
phenotypic O
bistability O
is O
characterized O
by O
two O
subpopulations O
that O
consist O
of O
either O
proliferating O
or O
nongrowing O
cells. O
This O
phenomenon, O
which O
is O
accompagnied O
by O
a O
hysteresis O
effect, O
could O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
activity O
of O
one O
of O
the O
iol O
promoters O
(P O

that O
in O
the O

the O
“on” O

by O
an O

mechanism O
24 O
, O
27 O
. O
However, O
the O
complex O
regulation O
of O
the O
iol O
genes O
in O

or O
in O

is O
not O
yet O
fully O
understood. O

However, O
the O
evidence O

suggests O
that O
Plasmodium O

has O
a O
significant O
effect O
on O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
cytochrome O
P450 O
(CYP) O
family O

DMEs. O
CYP3A O
enzymes O
are O
mainly O
responsible O
for O
quinine O
clearance O
via O
its O
3-hydroxylation O
[ O

], O
indirectly O
suggesting O
that O
expression O
of O
CYP3A O
may O
be O
reduced O
in O
Plasmodium-infected O
individuals. O
A O
study O
of O

found O
significantly O

In O

The O

However, O
i.c. O
injection O
into O

by O
needles O
is O
very O
different O
from O
human O
natural O
infection O
via O
an O
oral-fecal O
route O
26 O
. O
In O
another O
report, O
ICR O
mice O
were O
orally O
infected O
with O
a O
mouse-adapted O
strain O
(MP4) O
and O
VP1 O
protein O
was O
detected O
in O
the O
heart O
27 O
. O
While O
these O
two O
reports O
observed O
VP1 O
protein O
in O
the O
heart, O
they O
are O
different O
from O
our O
current O
study O
in O
several O
major O
ways: O
(1) O
Neither O
reports O
observed O
any O
heart O
diseases, O
such O
as O
EKG O
abnormality O
or O

26 O
, O
27 O
. O
(2) O
Neither O
reports O
observed O
any O
viral O
protein O
expression O
in O
the O
lung O
26 O
, O
27 O
. O
Similarly, O
in O
our O
own O
previous O
studies O
by O
i.p.-inoculation O
with O
the O
EV71 O
clinical O
isolate, O
we O
detected O
neither O
VP1 O
protein O
nor O
pathology O
in O
the O
heart O
and O
lung O
23 O
, O
28 O
. O
(3) O
Both O
reports O
relied O
on O
mouse-adapted O
strains, O
which O
deviated O
significantly O
from O
the O
original O
parental O
clinical O
isolate O
by O
accumulating O
a O
large O
number O
of O
additional O
artificial O

20 O
. O
In O
fact, O
using O
an O
oral O
route, O
the O
clinical O
isolate O
(parental O
strain O
4643) O
at O
10 O
7 O
pfu O
per O
mouse O
failed O
to O
infect O
any O
ICR O
mice, O
while O
the O
MP4 O
mouse-adapted O
strain O
infected O
70% O
of O
ICR O
mice O
27 O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
mouse O
models, O
oral O
infection O
with O
EV71 O
in O
a O
gerbil O
model O
was O
reported O
recently O
29 O
. O
While O
heart O
and O
lung O
edema O
was O
interpreted O
from O
the O
H&amp;E O
staining, O
no O
viral O
protein O
was O
shown O
by O
IHC. O
The O
outbred O
gerbil O

is O
less O
user-friendly, O
since O
no O
convenient O
ELISA O
assay, O
MHC O
antibody, O
or O
PCR O
reagents O
are O
available O
for O
immunopathology O
studies. O
Unexpectedly, O
in O
our O
current O
study O
in O
3-day-old O
mice O
i.p. O
or O
orally O
inoculated O
with O
a O

EV71-F6, O
we O
detected O
strong O

in O
nearly O
100% O
of O

From O
our O

we O
can O
clearly O
infer O

Increased O

that O

Strains O

Strains O

One O

two O

Based O
on O

[ O

it O
was O
speculated O
that, O
in O
addition O

high O
resistance O

by O

might O

Construction O

verify O
the O

The O
effect O
of O
rpoB O

on O
the O
resistance O
to O
rifampin O
was O
tested O
by O
constructing O
multiple O
rpoB O

strains, O
of O
which O
ATCC O
11845, O
ATCC O
11845-pLMF03 O
and O
ATCC O
11845-pLMF03::rpoB O
served O
as O
three O
control O
groups O
to O
exclude O
the O
influences O
of O
the O
plasmid O
itself O
and O
other O
sequences, O
except O
the O
point O
mutation O
in O
the O
rpoB O
gene, O
on O
rifampin O
resistance. O
The O
rifampin O
MICs O
of O
the O

are O
shown O
in O
Table O

The O
three O

showed O
no O

while O
the O
rifampin O
MICs O
of O
the O
overexpression O
strains O
all O
increased O
to O
at O
least O
128 O
μg/mL. O
The O
results O
indicated O
that O
these O
five O
rpoB O

indeed O
mediated O
rifampin O
resistance. O

However, O
other O
risk O
factors O
for O
the O
development O
of O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
and O
wheeze O
(i.e., O
asthma) O
in O
humans O
exist O
and O
the O
enhancement O
of O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
by O
RSV O
may O
be O
dependent O
on O
the O
individual's O
atopic O
background O
and O
current O
exposure O
to O
allergens O
or O
other O
environmental O
factors. O
Our O
hypothesis O
was O
that O
early O
exposure O
to O
RSV O
and O
allergen O
act O
synergistically O
to O
illicit O
inflammatory O
responses O
and O
long-term O
functional O
changes O
in O
the O
developing O
lung. O
We O
further O
hypothesized O
that O
these O
changes O
were O
the O
result O
of O
changes O
in O
airway O
structure O
(i.e., O
remodeling) O
and O
therefore, O
would O
compromise O
adult O
lung O
function. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
weanling O
mice O
were O
exposed O
to O
RSV O
and/or O
ovalbumin O
(Ova) O
to O
examine O
the O
effect O
of O
early O
exposures O
on O
pulmonary O
pathophysiology. O
We O
report O
that O
weanling O
mice O
infected O
with O
RSV O
then O
exposed, O
Ova O
fail O
to O
develop O
airway O
hyperreactivity O
(AHR) O
or O
long-term O
pathophysiologic O
changes, O
while O
weanling O
mice O
exposed O
first O
to O
Ova O
then O
infected O
with O
RSV O
developed O
increased O
AHR O
and O
long-term O
pulmonary O
pathologies. O
This O
increase O
in O
AHR O
was O
accompanied O
by O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
due O
to O
increased O
eosinophil O
and O
lymphocyte O
cell O
numbers, O
mucus O
cell O
hypertrophy, O
and O
enhanced O
mucus O
production. O
Intriguingly, O
the O
mice O
also O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
airway O
remodeling O
including O
subepithelial O
fibrosis. O
The O
observed O
remodeling O
events O
were O
correlated O
with O
increased O
levels O
of O
various O
cytokines O
including O
TNF-α, O
IFN-γ, O
IL-5, O
and O
IL-2. O
Collectively, O
these O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
RSV O
infections, O
when O
combined O
with O
an O
allergic O
predisposition, O
can O
have O
long-term O
consequences O
for O
the O
lung O
and O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
development O
of O

such O
as O

Disruption O

The O

the O

Without O

the O

can O
readily O

We O
found O
here O
that O
an O

that O
both O

contribute O
to O

[ O

we O
speculate O
that O

promotes O
basement O

by O
providing O
a O
scaffold O
for O
keratinocyte O

Indeed, O

improving O

also O
modulated O
the O

Discussion O
Our O
study O
shows O
a O
direct O
connection O
between O
cell O

and O
AirSR. O
More O
than O
20 O
genes O
that O
are O
related O
to O
cell O
wall O
metabolism O
were O
down-regulated O
in O
the O
airSR O
mutant, O
as O
shown O
by O
microarray O
analysis. O
Real-time O
RT O
PCR O
experiments O
confirmed O
the O
transcript O
level O
changes O
of O
several O
genes O
(cap5B, O
cap5D, O
tagA, O
SAOUHSC_00953, O
pbp1, O
murD, O
ftsQ, O
and O
ddl). O
Real-time O
RT O
PCR O
indicated O
that O
the O
transcription O
of O
a O
major O
autolysin, O
LytM, O
was O
down-regulated O
in O
the O
airSR O
mutant. O
This O
result O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
observation O
of O
a O
decreased O
autolysis O
rates O
induced O
by O
Triton O
X-100 O
in O
the O
airSR O

The O

Pla O
I259T O
modification O
was O
necessary O
for O
invasive O
infections O
As O
we O
observed O
reduced O

of O
bacteria O
in O
the O
spleens O
following O
i.n. O
infection O
with O
Pestoides O
F+Pla O
I259 O
compared O
with O
Pla O
T259, O
the O
data O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
5a O
led O
us O
to O
hypothesize O
that O
this O
modification O
of O
Pla O
may O
be O
more O
significant O
for O
dissemination O
or O
survival O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
during O
systemic, O
invasive O
infections, O
such O
as O
occurs O
during O
bubonic O
plague. O
To O
test O
this, O
we O
used O
the O
same O
strains O
in O
a O
subcutaneous O
(s.c.) O
mouse O
model O
of O
infection O
of O
bubonic O
plague O
and O
measured O
bacterial O
burden O
within O
the O
inguinal O
lymph O
nodes O
and O
spleens O
of O
infected O
mice. O
Mice O
infected O
with O
either O
the O
ancestral O
or O
modern O
Pla O
variant O
in O
the O
Pestoides O
F O
or O
CO92 O
background O
resulted O
in O
equivalent O
bacterial O
outgrowth O
within O
the O
inguinal O
lymph O
node O
after O
3 O
days O
( O
Fig. O
5b O
). O
However, O
we O
detected O
∼100-fold O
fewer O
bacteria O
in O
the O
spleens O
of O
mice O
infected O
with O
the O
ancestral O
I259 O
variant O
of O
Pla O
compared O
with O
Pla O
T259 O
in O
both O
the O
ancestral O
and O
modern O
strains O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
( O
Fig. O
5b O
). O
Moreover, O
Pestoides O
F O
is O
able O
to O
outgrow O
in O
the O
lymph O
node; O
however, O
it O
only O
disseminates O
to O
distal O
sites O
by O
day O
3 O
when O
harbouring O
pPCP1 O
( O
Fig. O
5b O
). O
Thus, O
these O
observations O
indicate O
that O
the O
I259T O
modification O
of O
Pla O
was O
important O
for O
Y. O
pestis O
to O
cause O
a O
disseminated, O
invasive O
infection O
from O
the O
site O
of O
inoculation, O
such O
as O
occurs O
during O
bubonic O
plague, O
in O
both O
modern O
and O
ancestral O
strains O
of O
Y. O
pestis. O

Again, O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
rule O
out O
the O
possibility O
that O
these O
genes O
were O
secondarily O
acquired O
by O
the O
nematode O
via O
HGT, O
although O
if O
this O
were O
the O
case O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
whether O
the O
donor O
was O
a O
plant O
or O
a O
fungus. O
As O
for O
the O
possible O
roles O
of O
CLO/PXGs O
in O
this O
nematode O
(which O
is O
apparently O
unique O
among O
Metazoa O
in O
harbouring O
such O
genes) O
the O
putative O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
were O
only O
found O
in O
parthenogenetic O
species O
in O
the O
genus O
and O
are O
functionally O
linked O
to O
cryptobiosis O
and O
especially O
to O
desiccation O
tolerance O
[ O
88 O
]. O
This O
is O
interesting O
because O
algal O
caleosins O
are O
highly O
upregulated O
following O
salt O
stress O
and O
this O
may O
have O
played O
a O
role O
in O
the O
transition O
of O
more O
complex O
plants O
from O
aquatic O
to O
terrestrial O
environments O
with O
the O
concomitant O
requirement O
for O
improved O
tolerance O
to O
desiccation O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
third O
non-fungal O
opisthokont O
genome O
with O
a O
putative O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
is O
the O
Amoebozoan, O
Planoprotostelium O

which O
is O
an O
exclusively O
mycophagous O
amoeba O
that O
predates O
upon O
a O
range O
of O
fungi O
that O
include O
Candida O
and O
Aspergillus O
spp. O
In O
this O
case O
open O

give O
the O

with O

from O

Our O
findings O
are O
in O
agreement O

results O

by O

[ O

where O
mRNA O

expression O

However, O
cathepsin O
L O
gene O
expression O
and O
protein O
level O
were O
enhanced O
in O
VACV-infected O
B O
cells. O
The O
authors O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O
reduced O
level O
of O
cathepsins O
may O
alter O
antigen O
processing O
and O
probably O
contributes O
to O
the O
loss O
of O

class O

function. O
Cathepsins O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
play O
essential O
roles O
in O
antigen O
processing, O
suggesting O
that O
they O
are O
involved O
in O
adaptive O
immune O
responses O
[ O
43 O
]. O
For O
example, O
studies O
focused O
on O
cathepsin O
S O
revealed O
that O
this O
acid-independent O
lysosomal O
cysteine O
protease O
mediates O
processing O
of O
outer O
capsid O
protein O
σ3 O
in O
macrophage-like O
P388D O
cells O
[ O
44 O
]. O
It O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
role O
of O
cysteine O
cathepsins O
in O
APCs, O
including O
DCs, O
is O
not O
limited O
only O
to O
antigen O
processing. O
Cathepsin O
B, O
D O
and O
S O
as O
well O
as O
cystatin O
C O
are O
important O
enzymes O
responsible O
for O
initiation O

removal O
of O
the O
MHC O

important O
role O
in O
this O
process O
[ O
45 O
– O
47 O
]. O
DCs O
isolated O
from O
cathepsin O
S-deficient O
C57BL/6 O

show O
a O
dramatically O
reduced O
distribution O
of O
MHC O
class O
II O
molecules O
on O
the O
cell O
surface O
[ O
48 O
]. O
Other O
studies O
also O
confirmed O
that O
cathepsin O
S O
is O
essential O
for O
efficient O
Ii O
processing, O
since O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
this O
protease, O
Ii O
degradation O
was O
markedly O
diminished O
in O
DCs O
[ O
49 O
] O
and O
B O
cells O
[ O

Interestingly, O
cathepsin O
L-deficient O
mice O
also O
exhibited O
defective O
MHC O
II-associated O
antigen O
presentation O
in O
cortical O
thymic O
epithelial O

(cTECs) O
as O
a O

of O

It O
appears O
that O
besides O
the O
role O
of O
cysteine O
cathepsins O
in O
antigen O
processing, O
they O
also O
participate O
in O
cell O
entry O
of O
many O
types O
of O
viruses, O
including O
Ebola O
virus O
(EBOV) O
[ O

human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
(HIV) O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
and O
reoviruses O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
]. O
However, O
the O
exact O
role O
of O
cathepsins O
during O
poxvirus O
infection O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
adequately O
investigated. O
The O
mousepox O
virus O
(ectromelia O
virus, O
ECTV) O
is O
a O
double O
stranded O
DNA O
virus O
that O
belongs O
to O
Poxviridae O
family O
of O
viruses O
in O
the O
genus O
Orthopoxvirus, O
the O
same O
genus O
that O
encompasses O
variola O
virus O
(VARV, O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
smallpox) O
and O
vaccinia O
virus O
(VACV) O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Infection O
of O
mice O
with O
ECTV O
causes O
symptoms O
much O
similar O
to O
those O
observed O
in O
people O
infected O
with O
VARV O
[ O
15 O
, O
16 O
]. O
Moreover, O
infection O
with O
ECTV O
is O
characterized, O
in O
contrast O
to O
VACV, O
by O
a O
narrow O
host O
range O
and O
the O
course O
of O
infection O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
that O
observed O
in O
humans O
infected O
with O
VARV O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Orthopoxviruses O
have O
well-evolved O
immune O
evasion O
strategies O
to O
elude O
and O
manipulate O
the O
host O
defense O
mechanisms O
[ O
18 O
– O
20 O
]. O
The O
activity O
of O
cysteine O
cathepsins O
is O
regulated O
by O
endogenous O
protein O
inhibitors O
called O
cystatins. O
There O
are O
three O
types O
of O
cystatins: O
type O
1 O
cystatins, O
also O
called O
stefins O
(A O
and O
B) O
are O
generally O
located O
intracellularly; O
type O
2 O
cystatins: O
C, O
D, O
E/M, O
F, O
S, O
SN O
and O
SA O
are O
extracellular O
proteins, O
and O
type O
3 O
cystatins O
– O
kininogens O
which O
are O
multifunctional O
plasma O
proteins O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
Beyond O
regulation O
of O
cysteine O
cathepsins O
activity O
cystatins O
also O
protect O
host O
cells O
from O
pathogens O
that O
use O
cysteine O
proteases O
for O
cell O
entry O
[ O
23 O
]. O

In O
summary, O
so O
far O
there O
has O
been O
no O
information O
on O
the O
mechanism O
of O
rifampin O
resistance O
in O
R. O
anatipestifer. O
Based O
on O
previous O
references O
and O
knowledge O
of O
R. O
anatipestifer O
resistance, O
our O
study O
suggests O
that O
rifampin O
resistance O
of O
R. O
anatipestifer O
isolates O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
mutations. O
We O
attempted O
to O
restore O
the O
mutant O
type O
of O
isolates O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
by O
using O
ATCC O
11845 O
as O
the O
parental O
generation O
to O
elucidate O
the O
origin O
of O
R. O
anatipestifer O
rifampin O
resistance. O
In O
this O
study, O
the O
rpoB O
protein O
sequences O
of O
18 O
R. O
anatipestifer O
strains O
were O
compared, O
and O
we O
speculated O
and O
validated O
the O
mutation O
sites O
that O
might O
be O
related O
to O
rifampin O
resistance. O
We O
then O
isolated O
rifampin-resistant O
mutants O
from O
ATCC O
11845 O
and O
analyzed O
a O
number O
of O
phenotypic O
characteristics O
of O
these O
mutants, O
including O
growth, O
growth O
in O
competition, O
nitroprusside O
sensitivity O
and O
hydrogen O
peroxide O
sensitivity. O
Finally, O
the O
fitness O
of O
the O
rpoB O

was O
evaluated O

Discussion O
As O
a O
main O
nitrogen O
source, O
ammonium O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
plant O
growth O
and O
development. O
Knowledge O
about O
ammonium O
uptake O
and O
translocation O
has O
been O
obtained O
by O
extensive O
investigations O
on O
ammonium O
transporters O
in O
Arabidopsis O
and O
rice. O
However, O
the O
physiological O
roles O
of O
AMTs O
in O
the O
interaction O
between O
plants O
and O
environmental O
microbes O
remain O
largely O
unknown. O
Although O
two O
types O
of O
AMTs O
share O
common O
secondary O
protein O
structures O
and O
biochemical O
activities, O
AMT2-type O
AMTs O
showed O
apparent O
difference O
in O
amino O
acid O
sequences, O
especially O
in O
those O
regions O
related O
to O
transport O
activity O
regulation. O
For O
example, O
the O
T460 O
residue O
in O
Arabidopsis O
AtAMT1 O
is O
conserved O
in O
all O
plant O
AMT1 O
proteins, O
and O
controls O
ammonium O
transport O
activity O
through O
phosphorylation O
and O
inactivation O
by O
the O
kinase O
CIPK23 O
upon O
extracellular O
ammonium O
exposure O
[ O
22 O
– O
24 O
]. O
A O
phosphomimetic O
mutation O
of O
MpAMT1;2 O
(T475D) O
from O
Marchantia O
polymorpha O
also O
exhibited O
complete O
loss O
of O
ammonium O
transport O
activity O
[ O
25 O
]. O
With O
regards O
to O
AMT2-type O
ammonium O
transporters, O
an O
alanine O
(A) O
is O
substituted O
for O
the O
threonine O
(T) O
at O
the O
corresponding O
T460 O
site O
of O
AtAMT1;1. O
Therefore, O
it O
seems O
that O
AMT2-type O
AMTs O
may O
play O
a O
unique O
role O
other O
than O
ammonium O
uptake. O

The O
prevalence O
of O
HBsAg O
and O
anti-HCV O
was O
2.5% O
(2/80) O
and O
8.75% O
(7/80), O
respectively. O
All O
of O
the O
80 O
hemophilia O
patients O
were O
negative O
for O
HIV O
and O
HTLV-1 O
antibody. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
HBV O
infection O
in O
hemophilia O
patients O
in O
this O
study O
was O
2.5%. O
Both O
patients O
with O
positive O
HBsAg O
having O
severe O
hemophilia O
were O
from O
Kabul O
and O
also O
have O
blood O
transfusion O
records. O
Thus, O
they O
might O
be O
infected O
by O
transfusion O
of O
contaminated O
blood. O
This O
study O
seems O
to O
be O
in O
agreement O
with O
all O
blood O
donors O
(with O
1.76% O
HBsAg O
seropositivity) O
tested O
by O
Central O
Blood O
Bank O
Kabul O
during O
the O
years O
1989–2005 O
10 O
. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
HBsAg O
in O
Iranian O
hemophilia O
patients O
varies O
from O
0% O
to O
1.6% O
in O
most O
cities O
11 O
, O
13 O
, O
14 O
and O
4.9% O
in O
Zahedan O
15 O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
vaccination O
against O
HBV O
infection O
in O
all O
newborns O
and O
high-risk O
groups O
in O
Iran O
and O
mandatory O
anti-HBV O
screening O
of O
blood O
and O
blood O
products O
may O
be O
the O
key O
to O
effective O
control O
of O
the O
infection O
in O
hemophilia O
patients. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
HCV O
in O
blood O
donors O
has O
been O
reported O
0.14% O
in O
Iran O
16 O
, O
17 O
, O
and O
3.01% O
to O
4.99% O
in O
Pakistan O
18 O
. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
HCV O
in O
Iranian O
hemophilia O
patients O
varies O
from O
51% O
to O
80.5% O
among O
different O
cities O
13 O
, O
16 O
, O
19 O
. O
Lower O
prevalence O
of O
HCV O
in O
Shiraz, O
Iran O
(with O
15% O
HCV O
seropositivity) O
can O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
stringent O
policy O
and O
guidelines O
for O
accurate O
HCV O
screening O
and O
blood O
product O
usage O
14 O
. O
Also O
because O
of O
compulsory O
anti-HCV O
screening O
in O
blood O
units O
since O
1996, O
the O
transmission O
of O
HCV O
in O
Iranian O
hemophilia O
patients O
has O
reduced O
remarkably. O

Similarly O
the O
phylogeny O
with O
all O
462 O
proteins O
present O
also O
displays O
very O
poor O
bootstrap O
support O
values O
(Additional O
file O
29 O
: O
Figure O
S6). O
To O
illustrate O
the O
degree O
of O
phylogenetic O
disagreement O
within O
the O
dataset, O
we O
reconstructed O
a O
neighbour-joining O
network O
of O
phylogenetic O
splits O
within O
the O
representative O
dataset O
alignment O
(Additional O
file O
29 O
: O
Figure O
S6). O
The O
network O
is O
highly O
congruent O
with O
the O
representative O
phylogeny O
(Fig. O
7 O
). O
Strongly O
supported O
clades O
found O
in O
the O
phylogeny O
can O
also O
be O
clearly O
seen O
in O
the O
network. O
However, O
there O
is O
a O
large O
degree O
of O
conflict O
regarding O
the O
sister O
group O
relationships O
amongst O
these O
clades O
as O
illustrated O
by O
the O
large O
number O
of O
alternative O
splits O
between O
clades O
(Additional O
file O
29 O
: O
Figure O
S6). O
Based, O
on O
both O
our O
phylogenetic O
and O
network O
analyses O
we O
suggest O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
confidently O
infer O
the O
true O
phylogenetic O
relationships O
amongst O
these O
proteins. O
A O
recent O
in O
silico O
analysis O
of O
the O
Mucoromycota O
species, O
Rhizophagus O
irregularis O
has O
suggested O
that O
this O
arbuscular O
mycorrhizal O
fungus O
has O
acquired O
19 O
genes O
via O
horizontal O
gene O
transfer O
from O
plants O
and O
bacteria O
[ O
69 O
]. O
One O
of O
these O
genes O
is O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
from O
a O
plant O
donor. O
Our O
phylogenetic O
analysis O
fails O
to O
confirm O
this O
finding. O
Firstly, O
other O
Mucoromycota O
species O
are O
grouped O
beside O
the O
R. O
irregularis O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
(Fig. O
7 O
). O
Therefore, O
if O
HGT O
did O
occur O
and O
R. O
irregularis O
contains O
a O
plant O
CLO/PXG O
ortholog, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
recent O
transfer O
into O
R. O
irregularis O
alone O
(Fig. O
7 O
&amp; O
Additional O
file O
28 O
: O
Figure O
S5). O
Secondly, O
the O
bootstrap O
supports O
and O
the O
network O
analysis O
grouping O
the O
basal O
fungi O
with O
the O
plants O
is O
very O
low O
(as O
described O
above). O
To O
infer O
that O
a O
HGT O
event O
has O
occurred, O
would O
mean O
that O
R. O
irregularis O
and O
indeed O
the O
ancestor O
of O
other O
basal O
fungi O
lost O
the O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
ortholog O
and O
acquired O
the O
plant O
copy O
instead, O
meanwhile O
Dikarya O
species O
retained O
a O
fungal O
ortholog. O

Indeed, O
sample O
FC3 O
(consisting O
of O
guts O
obtained O
through O
dissection) O
had O
the O
lowest O
proportion O
of O
Wolbachia O
reads. O
Cell O
separation O
is O
also O
expected O
to O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
Wolbachia O
DNA O
in O
the O
samples. O
Because O
of O
its O
intracellular O
location O
(gut O
epithelium, O
ovaries O
and O
brain), O
a O
method O
that O
separates O
the O
eukaryotic O
cells O
from O
the O
prokaryotic O
ones O
without O
lysing O
them O
should O
be O
effective O
in O
reducing O
the O
amount O
of O
host O
and O
Wolbachia O
DNA O
in O
the O
same O
step. O
However, O
in O
this O
study, O
a O
combination O
of O
dissection O
and O
filtering O
resulted O
in O
an O
increased O
amount O
of O
Wolbachia O
reads O
(9.26% O
in O
sample O
FC1 O
vs O
3.03% O
in O
sample O
FC2). O
Because O
of O
the O
difference O
in O
size O
between O
prokaryotic O
genomes O
and O
the O
host O
genome O
(resulting O
in O
sequencing O
biases), O
and O
because O
of O
possible O
lysis O
of O
host O
cells O
during O
the O
treatment O
of O
samples O
FC1 O
and O
FC2, O
resulting O
in O
the O
release O
of O
Wolbachia O
cells, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
conclude O
whether O
filtering O
was O
an O
effective O
strategy O
to O
reduce O
the O
representation O
of O
the O
endosymbiont O
in O
the O
metagenomic O
dataset. O
The O
number O
of O
contigs O
and O
the O
total O
length O
after O
assembly O
are O
comparable O
to O
other O
soil O
invertebrate-associated O
metagenomes O
26 O
– O
28 O
. O
Although O
this O
was O
not O
attempted O
here, O
it O
may O
be O
possible O
to O
recover O
the O
genome O
of O
one O
or O
more O
species O
using O
the O
data O
collected O
in O
this O
study O
29 O
. O
With O
826 O
bacterial O
genera O
identified, O
the O
level O
of O
diversity O
in O
F. O
candida O
approaches O
that O
described O
in O
the O
hindgut O
of O
termites, O
wood-feeding O
insects O
that O
have O
one O
of O
the O
most O
complex O

of O
any O

group O
30 O
. O
Other O
soil O
invertebrates O
are O
characterized O
by O
comparable O
or O
even O
higher O
levels O
of O
microbial O
diversity. O
For O
example, O
Pass O
et O
al. O
31 O
, O
studied O
the O
microbiome O
of O
the O
earthworm O
Lumbricus O
rubellus O
and O
found O
no O
less O
than O
9 O
120 O
host-specific O
OTUs. O
This O
very O
diverse O
community O
was O
dominated O
by O
Proteobacteria O
and O
Actinobacteria, O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
situation O
in O
F. O
candida. O

The O
transcriptional O
response O
to O
bedaquiline O
was O
opposite O
to O
the O

presented O
in O
Fig. O
3 O
for O
the O
classical O
anti-TB O
drugs O
(Peterson O

). O
Cyp121a1, O
cyp126a1, O
cyp137a1, O
and O
cyp141a1 O
were O
significantly O
downregulated, O
whereas O
cyp125a1 O
and O
FdxE O
were O
clearly O
upregulated. O
This O
alteration O
in O
transcriptome O

likely O
reflects O
the O
different O
mechanism O
of O

of O
bedaquiline, O
namely O
inhibition O

In O
addition, O
it O
could O
be O
the O
result O
of O
bedaquiline-induced O
decreased O
protein O
synthesis O
due O
to O
downregulation O
of O
ribosomal O

(Koul O

As O
stem O

leads O
to O
collapse O
of O
the O
vascular O
structure, O
we O
suggest O
that O
oozing, O
together O
with O
stem O
necrosis, O
is O
not O
only O
an O
important O
phenotype O
for O
assessing O
resistance O
to O

but O
also O
possibly O
points O
towards O
diverse O
mechanisms O
providing O
field O
resistance O
in O
A. O

that O
might O
involve O
cell O
wall O
strengthening O
and O
basal O
defense. O

First, O
we O
tested O
the O
effect O
of O
CDM O
on O
cell O
CPE O
protection O
provided O
by O
IFN-α, O
IFN-γ O
or O
the O
combination O
of O
both. O
For O
this O
purpose O
an O
experiment O
similar O
to O
that O
described O
in O
Figure O
2b O
was O
performed O
but O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM O
(50 O
μg/ml). O
The O
number O
of O
surviving O
cells O
was O
determined O
at O
12, O
24, O
36 O
and O
48 O
h O
p.i. O
(Figure O
2c O
). O
A O
comparison O
of O
Figure O
2b O
and O
2c O
shows O
that O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM O
alone O
Vero O
cells O
were O
highly O
protected O
from O
HSV-2 O
cytopathicity, O
since O
60% O
of O
infected O
cells O
remained O
viable. O
When O
CDM O
was O
combined O
with O
IFN-α O
or O
IFN-γ, O
the O
number O
of O
protected O
cells O
increased O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
effect O
of O
each O
interferon O
alone O
suggesting O
that O
the O
protection O
observed O
is O
due O
to O
CDM O
effect. O
Interestingly, O
when O
cells O
were O
treated O
with O
CDM O
plus O
IFN O
combination O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
additive O
antiviral O
effect, O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
was O
confirmed O
by O
next O
experiments. O
We O
also O
tested O
if O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM O
under O
different O
experimental O
conditions O
could O
affect O
the O
antiviral O
action O
of O
IFNs O
on O
HSV-2 O
MS O
replication. O
Virus O
yields O
at O
24 O
h O
p.i. O
were O
determined O
in O
Vero O
cells O
treated O
with O
CDM O
as O
follows: O
i) O
for O
2 O
h O
prior O
to O
interferon O
induction O
and O
then O
removed, O
ii) O
added O
simultaneously O
with O
IFN O
and O
remained O
only O
for O
16 O
h O
before O
infection, O
iii) O
added O
after O
virus O
infection O
and O
remained O
to O
virus O
harvest, O
iiii) O
added O
with O
IFN O
16 O
h O
before O
infection, O
re-added O
after O
infection O
and O
remained O
to O
virus O
harvest. O
The O
results O
obtained O
following O
protocol O
i) O
are O
depicted O
in O
Figure O
3a O
. O
The O
antiviral O
effect O
due O
to O
interferon O
alone O
or O
in O
combination O
is O
2-fold O
increased O
in O
cells O
pretreated O
with O
CDM, O
as O
an O
indication O
that O
CDM O
treatment O
did O
not O
interfere O
with O
the O
antiviral O
activity O
displayed O
by O
IFN O
alone O
or O
in O
combination. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
we O
can O
speculate O
that O
the O
antiviral O
effect O
of O
CDM O
alone O
contributed O
in O
an O
additive O
manner O
to O
the O
overall O
antiviral O
activity. O

For O
those O
that O
identified O
significant O
diseases, O
there O
were O
again O
distinct O
regional O
differences. O
The O
most O
common O
pathogen O
nationwide O
was O
stripe O
rust, O
which O
was O
also O
the O
most O
important O
disease O
in O

with O
the O
most O
disease O
pressure—the O

as O
the O
most O
important O
disease. O
However, O
this O
pathogen O
was O
not O
a O
problem O
in O
any O
other O
region. O
The O
most O
common O
disease O
identified O
in O
the O
Western O
region O
was O
barley O
yellow O
dwarf O
virus. O
Naked O
barley O
This O
research O
project O
is O
also O
interested O
in O
determining O
the O
potential O
interest O
organic O
farmers O
have O
in O
the O
adopting O
naked O
(free O
threshing) O
barley O
varieties. O
Nearly O
25% O
of O
the O
respondents O
had O
grown O
naked O
barley O
in O
the O
past O
three O
years. O
However, O
many O
indicated O
that O
they O
were O
unfamiliar O
with O
naked O
barley O
or O
had O
no O
experience O
with O
it. O
The O
producers O
reported O
smaller O
average O
plantings O
and O
considerably O
lower O
yields O
for O
naked O
barley. O
The O
average O
area O
planted O
to O
naked O
barley O
was O
9 O
ha, O
with O
an O
average O
yield O
of O
2283 O
kg/ha. O
The O
primary O
obstacle O
to O
planting O
more O
naked O
barley O
named O
by O
producers O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
seed. O
This O
was O
followed O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
winter O
hardiness, O
an O
insufficient O
premium O
over O
covered O
varieties, O
and O
insufficient O
storage O
capacity O
to O
keep O
varieties O
separate. O
Two O
producers O
who O
had O
grown O
naked O
barley O
in O
the O
past O
reported O
that O
not O
all O
the O
grains O
free-threshed O
and O
that O
some O
dehulling O
was O
required. O
Interviews O
All O
of O
the O
farmers O
who O
were O
interviewed O
talked O
about O
how O
barley O
fits O
within O
their O
production O
system O
and O
crop O
rotation. O
While O
there O
were O
common O
elements, O
each O
producer O
had O
a O
unique O
way O
of O
integrating O
barley O
into O
their O
farming O
system, O
in O
terms O
of O
place O
in O
rotation, O
cultural O
practices, O
variety O
selection, O
and O
end O
use. O
Several O
producers O
grew O
barley O
for O
multiple O
end-uses O
and O
were O
interested O
in O
a O
multi-purpose O
barley. O
Barley O
was O
the O
main O
crop O
only O
for O
farmers O
who O
were O
contract O
growing O
for O
malt O
houses. O
For O
those O
producers, O
variety O
selection O
was O
made O
by O
contract O
from O
the O
buyer. O
However, O
the O
majority O
of O
producers O
interviewed O
were O
primarily O
selling O
into O
the O
feed O
market, O
which O
reflects O
the O
survey O
results. O
Several O
farmers O
interviewed O
talked O
about O
the O
advantages O
that O
barley O
had O
in O
terms O
of O
land O
use, O
labor O
requirements, O
and O
equipment O
compliment. O

This O
again O

that O
the O

is O

Discussion O
We O
used O
a O
3D O
CNN O
model O
for O
charcoal O
rot O
disease O
classification O
because O
of O
its O
ability O
to O
learn O
the O
spatio-temporal O
features O
automatically O
without O
handcrafting O
and O
its O
ability O
to O
achieve O
high O
classification O
accuracy. O
Using O
a O
3D O
CNN O
allows O
accounting O
for O
both O
spatial O
and O
spectral O
correlations O
simultaneously. O
We O
incorporated O
saliency O
map O
enabled O
interpretability O
to O
track O
the O
physiological O
insights O
of O
model O
predictions. O
Hence, O
we O
are O
more O
confident O
of O
the O
predictive O
capability O
of O
our O
model O
and O
its O
biological O
basis. O
We O
envision O
that O
these O
explainability O

strategies O
for O
machine O
learning O
will O
be O
widely O
used O
in O
the O
plant O
science O
community O
as O
they O
decrease O
much O
of O
the O
mystery O
behind O
many O
current O
black O

techniques. O
Selection O
of O
individual O
wavebands O
for O
the O
detection O
of O
disease O
symptoms, O
among O
other O
traits, O
is O
of O
increasing O
importance. O
Many O
fields O
in O
the O
plant O
sciences O
are O
expanding O
to O
be O
able O
to O
utilize O
high O
throughput O
technologies O
in O
data O
collection. O
However, O
utilizing O
the O
high O
dimensional O
3D O
data O
sets O
takes O
enormous O
computing O
power O
promoting O
a O
need O
for O
a O
selection O
method O
to O
discriminate O
the O
most O
important O
information. O
In O
the O
future, O
trait O
specific O

based O
on O
robust O
interpretability O
mechanisms O
will O
be O
helpful O
in O
dimensionality O

of O

in O

for O
high O

phenotyping O
in O
field O
conditions O
for O
an O

A O
multispectral O

would O
incorporate O
only O
the O
most O
important O
wavelengths O
for O
a O
targeted O
set O
of O
stresses O
streamlining O
data O
collection O
and O

necessary O
for O
monitoring O
and O
improving O

health. O
The O
approach O
presented O
in O
this O
research O
allows O
for O
applications O
in O
precision O
and O
high O
throughput O
phenotyping O
as O
well O
as O

agriculture. O
This O
approach O
can O
help O
increase O
the O
throughput O
of O
disease O
assessment, O
after O
model O

in O
other O
stem O
diseases, O
enabling O
more O
robust O
large O

One O
potential O
limitation O
is O
the O
smaller O

size O
used O
in O
this O
study. O
We O
perform O
fivefold O
cross-validation O
based O
assessment O
to O
test O
the O
robustness O
of O
the O
model. O

In O
the O
Pelnac O
group, O
the O
cells O
from O
the O
graft O
had O
migrated O
to O
the O
wound O
surface O
through O
the O
Pelnac. O
During O
this O
process, O
the O
stratum O
corneum O
and O
transplanted O
dermis O
gradually O
separated O
from O
proliferating O
keratinocytes O
(Fig. O

but O
the O

was O
not O
observed O
in O
the O
Vaseline O

group O
until O
day O
14 O
(Fig. O
14 O
d). O
After O
migrating O
from O
the O
base O
to O
the O
surface, O
keratinocytes O
appeared O
to O
expand O
radially O
in O
all O
directions O
and O
participate O
in O
re-epithelialization, O
as O
reported O
in O
previous O
studies O
[ O

On O
postoperative O
day O
14, O
the O
micrograft O
structure O
was O
no O
longer O
visible O
in O
the O

group; O
epithelialization O
was O
mostly O
completed, O
and O
the O

had O
begun O
to O
form O
(Fig. O

on O

we O
found O
that O

During O
the O
first O
half O
of O
July, O
the O
Wixaritari O
observed O
the O
emergence O
of O
Amanita O
muscaria, O
and O
knew O
that O
A. O
basii O
and O
A. O
laurae O
would O
be O
found O
several O
weeks O
later. O
The O
mestizos O
waited O
until O
the O
final O
days O
of O
July O
to O
search O
for O
Pleurotus O
djamor O
and O
Volvariella O
bombycina O
in O
ravines O
or O
along O
steep O
slopes. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
Wixaritari O
preferred O
to O
search O
for O
these O
latter O
species O
at O
the O
end O
of O
August O
and O
beginning O
of O
September. O
In O
August, O
they O
also O
went O
to O
oak O
forests O
to O
search O
for O
Boletales. O
Ustilago O

was O
looked O
for O
between O
July O
and O
August. O
Only O
Amanita O
sect. O
Vaginata O
species O
and O
Lentinus O

were O
collected O
opportunistically. O
During O
September, O
the O
mestizos O
continued O
to O
consume O
P. O
djamor, O
whereas O
the O
Wixaritari O
preferred O
Cantharellus O
cibarius. O
Both O
groups O
considered O
coprophilous O
species O
to O
be O
present O
throughout O
the O
entire O
rainy O

In O
the O
centre O
of O
Mexico, O
women O
are O
usually O
in O
charge O
of O
collecting O
and O
selling O
mushrooms O
or, O
when O
both O
genders O
carry O
out O
this O
practice, O
men O
traverse O
greater O
distances O
because O
women O
often O
carried O
or O
took O
children O
with O
them O
and O
thus O
were O
slower O
(Montoya O
et O

). O
However, O
in O
the O
studied O
communities, O
the O
mushroom O
collection O
was O
carried O
out O
by O
both O
women O
and O
men, O
often O
accompanied O

their O
children O
making O
it O
a O

(Mariaca O

the O
Wixaritari O
and O
mestizos O
attributed O
the O
emergence O
of O
mushrooms O
to O
humidity O
rather O
than O
the O
time O

Nevertheless, O

Introduction O
Because O
plants O
are O
immobile, O
they O
must O
respond O
to O
and O
endure O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
environmental O
and O
biotic O
stresses O
in O
the O
field. O
Both O
abiotic O
and O
biotic O
stresses O
cause O
major O
yield O
losses O
to O
crops O
1 O
– O
4 O
. O
It O
is O
therefore O
not O
surprising O
that O
many O
crop O
improvement O
programs O
focus O
on O
developing O
stress O
tolerant O
plant O
varieties O
5 O
– O
7 O
. O
Breeding O
tolerance O
for O
a O
single O
stress O
(e.g. O
drought, O
salinity, O
pathogen, O
etc.) O
or O
a O
single O
stress O
type O
(e.g. O
abiotic O
or O
biotic) O
may O
be O
risky O
because O
plants O
respond O
uniquely O
to O
different O
or O
simultaneous O
stresses, O
and O
increasing O
tolerance O
to O
one O
stress O
may O
be O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
tolerance O
to O
another O
4 O
, O
8 O
. O
With O
climate O
change, O
more O
extreme O
weather O
events O
are O
occurring, O
increasing O
the O
likelihood O
that O
plants O
experience O
multiple O
stresses O
in O
the O
field, O
including O
additional O
pressure O
from O
plant O
diseases O
9 O
. O
There O
is, O
therefore, O
a O
need O
to O
understand O
the O
similarities O
and O
differences O
among O
stress O
response O
pathways O
to O
best O
optimize O
targeted O
crop O

Plants O
respond O
to O
stress O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
ways. O
Common O
plant O
responses O
to O
avoid O
or O
tolerate O
abiotic O
stresses O
include O
stomatal O
closure, O
reduced O
photosynthesis, O
increased O
reactive O
oxygen O
scavenging O
activity, O
reduced O
leaf O
growth O
and O
increased O
root O
length O
10 O
. O
Biotic O
stresses O
such O
as O
pathogens O
also O
cause O
plants O
to O
close O
stomata O
and O
reduce O
photosynthesis O
11 O
, O
12 O
. O
Other O
plant O
responses O
to O
pathogens O
include O
production O
of O
toxic O
compounds, O
including O
phytoalexins O
and O
reactive O
oxygen O
species, O
and O
induction O
of O
localized O
cell O
death O
13 O
. O
Many O
of O
these O
responses O
are O
coordinated O
by O
phytohormones O
14 O
, O
15 O
. O
The O
hormones O
abscisic O
acid O
(ABA) O
and O
jasmonic O
acid O
(JA) O
are O
critical O
regulators O
of O
tolerance O
to O
abiotic O
stresses. O
For O
immunity O
to O
pathogens, O
plants O
primarily O
rely O
on O
salicylic O
acid O
(SA), O
JA O
and O
ethylene O
signaling. O
The O
abiotic O
stress O
response O
is O
regulated O
by O
many O

families, O
both O
ABA-dependent O
and O

Introduction O
Cryptococcus B-PATH
neoformans I-PATH
is O
an O
environmental O
fungus O
that O
causes O
fatal O
human O
and O
animal O
disease. O
In O
humans, O
cryptococcosis O
causes O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
deaths O
each O
year, O
the O
vast O
majority O
in O
immunocompromised O
patients O
1 O
. O
As O
with O
many O
significant O
pathogens, O
cryptococci O
are O
able O
to O
parasitise O
host O
cells. O
This O
potential O
for O
an O
intracellular O
lifestyle O
allows O
C. B-PATH
neoformans I-PATH
the O
potential O
to O
evade O
additional O
host O
immune O
responses O
and O
thus O
spread O
within O
the O
body, O
leading O
to O
systemic O
disease O
2 O
, O
3 O
. O
Cryptococcus O
has O
a O
remarkably O
broad O
host O
range O
but O
with O
significant O
variation O
in O
susceptibility O
between O
species O
in O
both O
natural O
and O
experimentally O
induced O
infection O
4 O
. O
Birds O
are O
particularly O
resistant O
to O
disease, O
despite O
diverse O
avian O
orders O
(Passeriformes, O
Anseriformes, O
Accipitriformes, O
Apterygiformes, O
Psittaciformes O
and O
Columbiformes) O
showing O

The O
exposure O
of O
birds O
to O
cryptococci O
in O
the O
environment O
will O
result O
in O
carriage O
externally O
on O
e.g. O
beaks O
and O

but O
also O
internal O

following O

guano O
is O
an O
excellent O
growth O
medium O
for O
Cryptococcus O
and O
external O
carriage O
of O
cryptococci O
by O
birds O
is O
a O
likely O
route O
for O
inoculation O
along O
with O
air O
dispersion O
of O
spores. O
However, O
if O
cryptococci O
are O
able O
to O

this O
would O
provide O

Transmission O
of O
this O

has O
important O
implications O
both O
for O
public O
health O
(e.g. O

The O
underlying O
mechanism O
of O
avian O
resistance O
to O
cryptococcosis O
is O
unknown O
but O
has O
been O
hypothesised O
to O
be O
reliant O
on O
higher O
body O
temperature O
21 O
. O
Here O
we O
test O
this O
hypothesis O
directly O
and O
show, O
surprisingly, O
that O
high O
body O
temperature O
alone O
is O
insufficient O
to O
prevent O
cryptococcal O
growth. O
However, O
at O
avian O
body O
temperatures, O
bird O
macrophages O
strongly O
suppress O
fungal O
growth O
but O
a O
small O
proportion O
of O
the O
fungal O
cell O
population O
escape O
killing. O
Thus, O
we O
suggest O
a O
model O
whereby O
birds O
can O
harbour O
low O
numbers O
of O
cryptococci O
for O
prolonged O
periods O
without O
disease O
and O
are O
therefore O
able O
to O
act O
as O
vectors O
of O
long-range O
fungal O
carriage O
and O
are O
able O
to O
directly O

Given O
the O
importance O

cryptococcal O
infection, O
we O
established O
a O

avian O

to O
investigate O
Cryptococcus O

in O

To O
achieve O
this, O
we O

macrophages O
from O

were O
a O

( O

After O
48 O
hours O
heterophils O
were O
lost O
and O

macrophages O
(MDMs) O
remained O
( O

The O

It O
is O

whether O

From O

it O
could O
be O
concluded O
that O
the O
colonization O

of O
both O
mutant O
strains O
in O
the O

was O
reduced O
compared O
to O
the O

Compared O
with O
the O

the O
statistical O

was O
significant O
(P O

The O
number O

reached O
a O

The O

were O
also O
detected O
in O
the O

but O
the O
number O
of O
colonizing O
bacteria O
in O
the O

was O
still O
much O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
the O

though O
it O
gradually O
decreased O
over O

In O

the O

was O
also O
examined O

Since O
the O

Discussion O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
drug O
resistance O
of O
R. O
anatipestifer O
has O
become O
increasingly O
serious, O
and O
various O
mechanisms O
of O
drug O
resistance O
have O
gradually O
been O
revealed, O
such O
as O
those O
for O
resistance O
to O
chloramphenicol O
[ O
13 O
], O
lincomycin O
[ O
14 O
], O
aminoglycosides O
[ O
15 O
] O
and O
rifampin O
[ O
16 O
]. O
However, O
the O
resistance O
mechanism O
of O
rifampin O
has O
not O
been O
reported. O
Among O
other O
bacteria, O
rifampin O

mechanisms O
have O
been O
reported, O
including O
mutations O
in O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
encoding O
the O

[ O

All O

a O

with O
either O
IL-6 O
or O
IL-8 O
belonged O
to O
the O
phylum O
Proteobacteria O
(Biagi O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
low-grade O
systemic O
inflammation O
constitutes O
a O
common O
denominator O
in O
neurodegenerative O
and O
vascular O
diseases, O
possibly O
via O
detrimental O
effects O
on O
the O
vasculature O
and O
leading O
to O
a O
dysfunctional O
brain-blood O
barrier O
and O
inflammatory O
stimuli O
of O
the O
brain. O
Elevated O
peripheral O
inflammation O
could O
also O
affect O
brain O
inflammation O
by O
the O
“priming” O
of O
neurones, O
i.e. O
making O
them O
more O
prone O
to O
a O
pro-inflammatory O
response O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
tissue O
damage O
(Holmes O
et O
al., O
2009 O
). O
In O
addition, O
chronic O
inflammation O
during O
foetal O
and O
childhood O
development O
could O
negatively O
affect O
brain O
development O
and O
lower O
the O
“cognitive O
reserve” O
(Borenstein O
et O
al., O
2006 O
). O
The O
researchers O
noted O
that O
the O
affected O
AD O
brains O
are O
largely O
inflamed, O
glial O
cells O
rushing O
to O
the O
brain O
regions O
that O
become O
ill O
and O
trying O
to O
clean O
up O
waste O
products O
from O
cells O
and O
plaque, O
but O
once O
up O
to O
this O
area, O
they O
in O
fact O
are O
urged O
to O
liberate O
more O
Aβ O
harmful, O
precipitate O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
plaque, O
which O
attracts O
more O
accurate O
glial O
cells, O
and O
so O
on. O
According O
to O
Balin O
et O
al O
and O
other O
studies, O
amyloid O
proteins O
play O
a O
part O
in O
the O
disease, O
but O
only O
in O
response O
to O
the O
initial O
inflammation O
caused O
by O
the O
microbial O
infection, O
that O
is O
attacking O
the O
brain O
(Balin O
and O
Hudson, O
2014 O
). O
Recent O
study O
showed O
that O
Aβ O
may O
play O
a O
protective O
role O
in O
innate O
immunity O
and O
infectious O
or O
sterile O
inflammatory O
stimuli O
may O
drive O
amyloidosis O
and O
that O
Aβ O
oligomerization, O
a O
behavior O
traditionally O
viewed O
as O
intrinsically O
pathological, O
may O
be O
necessary O
for O
the O
antimicrobial O
activities O
of O
the O

which O
mean O
that O
Aβ O
serves O
to O
protect O
the O

before O

may O
be O
the O
most O
parsimonious O
explanation O
of O
the O
otherwise O
anomalous O
distribution O
of O
this O
gene O
family O
in O
eukaryotes. O
CLO/PXG-like O

are O

annotated O
in O

such O
as O

as O
‘caleosin’ O

‘peroxygenase’ O
although O

labelled O
variously O
as O
‘hypothetical O

‘ABA-induced O

or O
‘EF O

In O
view O
of O
their O
widespread O
designations O
as O
either O
caleosins O
(CLO) O
and/or O
peroxygenases O

we O

In O
both O

CLO/PXG O

have O
been O
shown O
to O

Several O

are O
catalysed O
by O
both O
fungal O

This O
gave O
a O
good O
degree O
of O
confidence O
that O
metronidazole O
monotherapy O
would O
provide O
sufficient O
antimicrobial O
therapy. O
Although O
clindamycin O
was O
indicated O
as O
another O
possible O
therapy O
by O
sensitivity O
testing, O
it O
is O
not O
usual O
practice O
in O
the O
UK O
to O
use O
clindamycin O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
any O
bacterial O
endocarditis O
[ O
37 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
a O
prolonged O
course O
of O
clindamycin O
was O
potentially O
harmful O
due O
to O
the O
significant O
associated O
risk O
of O
Clostridium O
difficile O
infection O
[ O
38 O
]. O
This O
supported O
the O
decision O
to O
treat O
with O
oral O
metronidazole O
alone. O
In O
contrast O
to O
our O
case, O
the O
POET O
trial O
includes O
patients O
with O
endocarditis O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
heart O
caused O
by O
Streptococcus, O
Enterococcus B-PATH
faecalis, I-PATH
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus, I-PATH
or O
coagulase-negative O
Staphylococci O
[ O
4 O
]. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
this O
patient, O
blood O
cultures O
were O
positive O
for O
F. B-PATH
magna, I-PATH
an O
anaerobic O
organism. O
Infective O
endocarditis O
caused O
by O
anaerobic O
pathogens O
remains O
relatively O
uncommon, O
and O
accounts O
for O
only O
2–16% O
of O
all O
cases O
of O
infective O
endocarditis O
over O
the O
past O
four O
decades O
[ O
39 O
– O
42 O
]. O
The O
POET O
trial O
did O
not O
include O
patients O
in O
whom O
an O
anaerobic O
pathogen O
was O
the O
causative O
organism. O
This O
case O
has O
demonstrated O
that O
switching O
to O
oral O
antibiotic O
therapy O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
an O
anaerobic O
infective O
endocarditis O
could O
also O
be O
satisfactory, O
but O
further O
research O
is O
required O
to O
prove O
if O
this O
statement O
could O
be O
substantiated O
with O
clinical O
evidence. O
In O
addition, O
when O
switching O
to O
the O
oral O
route O
in O
the O
POET O
trial, O
all O
oral O
regimens O
included O
two O
antibiotics O
from O
different O
drug O
classes O
and O
with O
different O
antibacterial O
effects O
and O
different O
metabolization O
processes. O
This O
was O
to O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
pharmacokinetic O
variations O
of O
the O
orally O
administered O
antibiotics O
[ O
43 O
]. O
We O
have O
differed O
in O
offering O
only O
metronidazole O
as O
monotherapy, O
for O
the O
reasons O
outlined O
above O
and O
with O
a O
good O
degree O
of O
confidence O
that O
it O
would O
provide O
suitable O
cover. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
HSV-1 O
it O
was O
reported O
that O
the O
resistance O
to O
IFNα/β O
is O
an O
active O
process O
that O
is O
dependent O
on O
the O
expression O
of O
at O
least O
two O
viral O
proteins O
the O
immediate O
early O
protein O
ICP0 O
[ O
28 O
, O
29 O
] O
and O
ICP34.5 O
[ O
30 O
, O
31 O
]. O
Expression O
of O
ICP0 O
also O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
resistance O
of O
HSV-1 O
to O
IFN-γ[ O
32 O
]. O
Thus O
explaining O
why O
IFNα/β O
or O
IFN-γ O
alone O
are O
weak O
inhibitors O
of O
HSV-1 O
wild O
type O
virus O
replication. O
Strikingly, O
recent O
studies O
showed O
that O
co-activation O
of O
IFNα/β O
and O
IFN-γ O
receptors O
renders O
cells O
highly O
resistant O
to O
HSV-1 O
replication O
[ O
20 O
]. O
This O
finding O
is O
turning O
to O
be O
a O
general O
phenomenon O
since O
a O
synergistic O
antiviral O
effect O
of O
the O
combination O
of O
IFN-α O
and O
IFN- O
γ O
was O
also O
demonstrated O
for O
other O
members O
of O
Herpesviridae O
[ O
20 O
, O
23 O
, O
33 O
] O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
RNA O
viruses O
like O
SARS O
[ O
34 O
], O
Lassa O
virus O
[ O
35 O
] O
and O
HCV O
[ O
25 O
]. O
Considering O
this O
background O
the O
current O
investigation O
was O
undertaken O
to O
determine O
if O
IFN O
combination O
inhibited O
in O
a O
synergistic O
manner O
HSV-2 O
replication O
in O
Vero O
cells, O
and O
if O
so O
to O
determine O
if O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
plant O
derived O
antiviral O
compound O
CDM O
could O
affect O
the O
antiviral O
state O
induced O
by O
IFN-α O
or O
IFN-γ O
or O
their O
combination. O
As O
expected, O
the O
results O
shown O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
Figure O
1a O
and O
Figure O
2b O
, O
clearly O
demonstrated O
that O
HSV-2 O
plaque O
formation, O
viral O
replication O
and O
the O
onset O
of O
viral O
CPE O
in O
Vero O
cells O
are O
synergistically O
inhibited O
by O
interferon O
combination. O
Whereas, O
individual O
cytokines O
were O
weak O
inducers O
of O
the O
antiviral O
response, O
independently O
of O
the O
concentration O
tried O
was O
100 O
or O
200 O
IU O
(Table O
1 O
). O
Importantly, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
two O
cytokines, O
individually O
or O
collectively, O
were O
harmful O
to O
uninfected O
or O
HSV-2 O
infected O
cells O
at O
the O
concentration O
used O
(Figure O
2a O
and O
2b O
). O

This O
step O
was O
actually O
used O
to O
find O
biomarker O
OTUs O
in O
each O
diarrheic O
individual. O
Second, O
from O
the O
filtered O
OTUs O
of O
the O
first O
step, O
two O
kinds O
of O
OTUs O
were O
focused O
on: O
the O
OTUs O
that O
can O
be O
annotated O
to O
a O
known O
pathogen O
or O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
and O
the O
OTUs O
that O
were O
less O
than O
0.5% O
abundant O
in O
each O
healthy O
individual O
and O
more O
than O
2.5% O
abundant O
in O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
diarrheic O
individuals. O
The O
results O
of O
this O
analysis O
were O
shown O
in O
a O

Our O
results O
showed O
that O
the O

was O
caused O
by O
the O
known O
pathogen O
Clostridium B-PATH
neonatale I-PATH
[ O

which O
was O
not O

was O

at O
an O

of O
less O

0.5% O
in O

the O
other O

but O
was O
presented O
in O

at O
an O

of O
21.8%. O
The O

was O
infected O
by O
another O
clostridium O
pathogen, O
Clostridium B-PATH
perfringens I-PATH
[ O

with O
an O
abundance O
of O
16.0%, O
followed O
by O
two O
Bacteroides O
species, O
Bacteroides O
ovatus O
(14.4%) O
and O
Bacteroides O
fragilis O
(10.6%). O
PE4 O
and O
PE15 O
showed O
similar O
pathogen O
combinations O
including O
Acinetobacter B-PATH
guillouiae I-PATH
(5.4% O
and O
5.6%), O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
stutzeri I-PATH
(12.2% O
and O
10.3%), O
and O
Enterococcus O
spp., O
with O
the O
former O
two O
bacteria O
in O
distinctively O
high O
abundances O
compared O
with O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
of O
the O
healthy O
infants O
and O
other O
diarrheic O
infants. O
PE15 O
presented O
with O
higher O
abundances O
of O
Rothia O
mucilaginosa O
(15.4%) O
and O
Streptococcus O
peroris O
(15.8%), O
while O
PE4 O
did O
not. O

The O
authors O
indicated O
that O
different O
α-synuclein O
forms O
can O
spread O
from O
the O
gut O
to O
the O
brain, O
and O
that O
microtubule-associated O

is O
joined O
in O
the O
translocation O
of O
aggregated O
α-synuclein O
in O
neurons O
(Holmqvist O
et O
al., O
2014 O
). O
In O
addition, O
Scheperjans O
et O
al O
studied O
the O
microbiota O
composition O
in O
PD O
patients O
and O
healthy O
controls. O
The O
results O
suggested O
a O
significant O
decrease O
of O
Prevotellaceae O
in O
PD O
patients O
and O
the O
subjects O
with O
a O
lower O
abundance O
of O
Prevotellaceae O
(&lt;6.5% O
in O
relative O
abundance) O
showed O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
PD. O
In O
another O
study, O
the O
abundance O
of O
Enterobacteriaceae O
was O
positively O
correlated O
with O
the O
severity O
of O
PD O
regarding O
gait O
difficulty O
and O
postural O
instability O
(Scheperjans O
et O

). O
The O
role O
of O
gut O
microbiota O
in O
ad O
via O
the O
inflammation O
regulatION O
Inflammation O
is O
the O
body’s O
response O
to O
infections O
and O
tissue O
injury O
and O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
is O
orchestrated O
by O
the O
cells O
of O
the O
immune O
system; O
both O
from O
the O
“adaptive” O
branch O
(including O
T- O
and O
B-cells O
with O
the O
capacity O
to O
induce O
long-term O
memory O
of O
encountered O
pathogens, O
“immunisation”) O
and O
the O
“innate” O
branch O
(including O
monocytes, O
macrophages, O
dendritic O
cells, O
and O
mast O
cells, O
that O
are O
targeted O
against O
common O
pathogen O
antigens). O
Inflammation O
was O
first O
implicated O
in O
AD O
pathology O
and O
development O
in O
the O
1990s, O
with O
the O
neuropathological O
finding O
of O
activated O
inflammatory O
cells O
(microglia O
and O
astrocytes) O
and O
inflammatory O
proteins O
(e.g. O
cytokines O
and O
complement), O
surrounding O
the O
amyloid O
plaques O
and O
the O
neurofibrillary O
tangles O
(Aisen O
and O
Davis, O
1994 O
). O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
epidemiological O
findings, O
patients O
suffering O
from O
arthritis O
and O
other O
patient O
groups O
with O
a O
high O
intake O
of O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
(NSAID) O
were O
observed O
to O
have O
had O
a O
lower O
proportion O
of O
individuals O
affected O
with O
AD. O

Nonetheless, O
the O
literature O
considers O
many O
of O
these O
enteric O
flagellates O
as O
commensals O
within O
intestinal O
tract O
of O
amphibians O
(Densmore O
and O
Green O
2007 O
; O
Mutschmann O
2010 O
). O
Conversely, O
some O
genera O
of O
diplomonadids O
(Giardia, O
Hexamita, O
Spironucleus) O
and O
trichomonadids O
(Monocercomonas, O
Hexamastix, O
Tritrichomonas) O
can O
cause O
weight O
loss, O
general O
edema, O
and O
enteritis O
in O
severely O
infected O
animals. O
The O
clinical O
relevance O
of O
flagellated O
protozoan O
infections O
was O
demonstrated O
during O
conducted O
dissections: O
Out O
of O
all O
dissected O
animals, O
four O
(3.7%) O
died O
because O
of O
severe O
Tritrichomonas O
spp.- O
and/or O
Spironucleus O
spp.-derived O
enteritis. O
These O
animals O
showed O
severe O
catarrhalic- O
to O
hemorrhagic-necrotic O
enteritis O
combined O
with O
secondary O
bacterial O
infections O
(e.g., O
Pseudomonas O
spp./Sphingobacterium O
spp.) O
of O
liver O
and O
gut O
mucosa. O
Only O
five O
animals O
(3.7%) O
were O
positive O
for O
Blastocystis O
spp. O
infections. O
Conversely O
to O
our O
findings, O
Yoshikawa O
et O
al. O
( O
2004 O
) O
found O
anurans O
and O
newts O
from O
distinct O
locations O
in O
Japan O
to O
be O
infected O
with O
Blastocystis O
showing O
very O
high O
prevalences O
(47.8–100%) O
by O
using O
in O
vitro O
culture O
diagnostic O
methods. O
Our O
observed O
Blastocystis O
prevalence O
might O
have O
been O
higher O
if O
this O
in O
vitro O
cultivation O
method O
would O
have O
been O
applied, O
but O
it O
cannot O
be O
excluded O
that O
this O
parasite O
is O
simply O
less O
frequently O
found O
in O
German O
pet O
amphibians. O
Unfortunately, O
there O
is O
still O
very O
little O
knowledge O
on O
amphibian-related O
blastocystiosis. O
The O
same O
holds O
true O
for O
its O
possible O
impact O
on O
animal O
health O
kept O
in O
captivity O
(Mutschmann O
2010 O
). O
Nevertheless, O
Blastocystis O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
potentially O
pathogenetic O
protozoan O
species O
and O
infections O
should O
be O
considered O
according O
to O
clinical O
symptoms. O

Our O
phylogenetic O
analysis O
fails O
to O
confirm O
this O
finding. O
Firstly, O
other O
Mucoromycota O
species O
are O
grouped O
beside O
the O
R. O
irregularis O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
(Fig. O
7 O
). O
Therefore, O
if O
HGT O
did O
occur O
and O
R. O
irregularis O
contains O
a O
plant O
CLO/PXG O
ortholog, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
recent O
transfer O
into O
R. O
irregularis O
alone O
(Fig. O
7 O
&amp; O
Additional O
file O
28 O
: O
Figure O
S5). O
Secondly, O
the O
bootstrap O
supports O
and O
the O
network O
analysis O
grouping O
the O
basal O
fungi O
with O
the O
plants O
is O
very O
low O
(as O
described O
above). O
To O
infer O
that O
a O
HGT O
event O
has O
occurred, O
would O
mean O
that O
R. O
irregularis O
and O
indeed O
the O
ancestor O
of O
other O
basal O
fungi O
lost O
the O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
ortholog O
and O
acquired O
the O
plant O
copy O
instead, O
meanwhile O
Dikarya O
species O
retained O
a O
fungal O
ortholog. O
This O
scenario O
is O
most O
un-parsimonious, O
what O
is O
more O
likely O
is O
that O
the O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
the O
last O
eukaryote O
common O
ancestor O
(LECA) O
and O
was O
subsequently O
lost O
in O
all O
lineages O
except O
for O
the O
fungal O
and O
plant O
kingdoms. O
The O
presence O
of O
CLO/PXG O
orthologs O
in O
all O
plant O
genomes O
sequenced O
to O
date O
would O
suggest O
that O
it O
is O
an O
important O
core O
housekeeping O
gene O
while O
the O
somewhat O
more O
patchy O
phyletic O
distribution O
amongst O
fungal O
species O
(even O
sister O
species) O
suggests O
that O
it O
is O
an O
accessory O
gene O
that O
may O
be O
beneficial O
to O
have O
in O
particular O
environments O
or O
niches. O
Discussion O
Three O
general O
observations O
can O
be O
made O
from O
our O
analysis O
of O
the O
distribution O
of O
CLO/PXG-like O
sequences O
in O
fungal O
genomes. O
First O
, O
this O
gene O
family O
is O
present O
in O
all O
the O
major O
fungal O
groups O
from O
the O
most O
primitive O
to O
the O
most O
recently O
evolved. O
Interestingly, O
CLO/PXG-like O
sequences O
are O
present O
in O
the O
two O
basal O
clades, O
Microsporidia O
and O
Cryptomycota, O
which O
have O
only O
very O
recently O
(and, O
to O
date, O
not O
unanimously) O
been O
accepted O
as O
likely O
members O
of O
the O
Fungi O
[ O
89 O
– O
94 O
]. O

Their O
approach O
relies O
on O
two O
core O
principles: O
first, O
that O
contaminant O
sequences O
are O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
total O
sequencing O
reads O
(the O
frequency-based O
approach), O
and O
second, O
that O
contaminant O
sequences O
are O
present O
in O
more O
controls O
than O
samples O
(the O
prevalence-based O
approach). O
Their O
work O
employs O
several O
statistical O
methods O
that O
culminate O
in O
a O
classification O
threshold O
ranging O
from O
0 O
to O
1. O
Once O
the O
threshold O
is O
set O
(the O
authors O
recommend O
0.1 O
to O
start), O
a O
list O
of O
contaminant O
DNA O
can O
be O
compiled. O
Analyzing O
sequences O
according O
to O
these O
principles O
eliminates O
the O
need O
to O
assign O
an O
arbitrary O
threshold O
for O
removing O
sequences O
and O
reduces O
reliance O
on O
an O
a O
priori O
set O
list O
of O
known O
contaminants. O
Davis O
et O
al. O
then O
provide O
a O
user-friendly O
R O
package O
entitled O
decontam O
and O
validate O
their O
approach O
on O
multiple O
datasets O
to O
demonstrate O
robust O
detection O
of O
contaminating O
sequences O
in O
both O
shotgun O
and O
16S O
sequencing O
results O
[ O
22 O
, O
23 O
]. O
The O
approach O
employed O
by O
Davis O
et O
al. O
is O
particularly O
useful O
in O
identifying O
contamination O
in O
low O
biomass O
samples, O
and O
the O
authors O
rightly O
point O
out O
that O
the O
assumptions O
of O
their O
approach O
break O
down O
when O
the O
contaminant O
mass O
(C) O
approaches O
the O
total O
input O
sample O
mass O
(S). O
For O
any O
given O
sample O
in O
any O
given O
mNGS O
experiment, O
the O
exact O
limit O
at O
which O
input O
sample O
mass O
becomes O
so O
small O
that O
contamination O
dominates O
the O
results O
remains O
unknown. O
In O
our O
own O
work O
in O
the O
area O
of O
clinical O
mNGS, O
this O
issue O
has O
been O
a O
cause O
of O
constant O
concern O
[ O
16 O
, O
24 O
]. O
Paralleling O
the O
work O
of O
Davis O
et O
al., O
we O
sought O
better O
methods O
to O
characterize O
the O
lower O
limit O
of O
sample O
input O
in O
order O
to O
automatically O
both O
identify O
and O
quantify O
the O
contribution O
of O
each O
contaminating O
component. O
Here, O
we O
suggest O
an O
amendment O
to O
the O
method O
of O
Davis O
et O
al. O
This O
improvement O
relies O
on O
determining O
an O
association O
between O
sequencing O
read O
output O
and O
input O
mass, O
made O
possible O
through O
the O
incorporation O
of O
a O
series O
of O
precise O
spike-in O
controls. O
In O
doing O
so, O
a O
straightforward O
statistical O
method O
allows O
the O
identification O
and O
separation O
of O
contaminating O
components O
from O
those O
inherent O
to O
the O
sample O
itself, O
without O
censoring. O

Viability O
of O
the O
airSR O

in O
the O
presence O
of O
vancomycin O
Since O
vancomycin O
is O
an O
important O
antibiotic O
that O
targets O
S. O
aureus O
cell O
wall, O
we O
tested O
the O
viability O
of O
S. O
aureus O
in O
MH O
agar O
plates O
with O
vancomycin. O
The O
wild-type O
and O
the O
airSR O
mutant O
were O
able O
to O
grow O
at O
a O
maximum O
concentration O
of O
0.6 O
μg/ml O
vancomycin, O
whereas O
the O
airSR O
mutant O
formed O
significantly O
fewer O
colonies O
(Figure O

We O
also O
tested O
cell O
growth O
in O
MH O
broth O
containing O
various O
concentrations O
of O
vancomycin. O
The O
cells O
were O
incubated O
in O
MH O
broth O
at O
an O
inoculum O
of O
1 O

10 O
7 O
CFU/ml, O
with O
constant O
shaking O
at O
37°C. O
No O
significant O
difference O
was O
observed O
when O
cells O
grew O
in O
MH O
broth O
without O
vancomycin. O
The O
airSR O
mutant O
exhibited O
a O
clear O
growth O

compared O
to O
the O
wild-type O
in O
the O
medium O
containing O
1.0 O

(Figure O

Taken O
together, O
these O
results O
indicate O
that O
the O
airSR O
inactivation O
reduced O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
bacteria O
to O
survive O
in O
the O

of O

These O

that O

greatly O
affected O
the O

the O

less O

Altogether, O
the O

indicate O
that O

restricts O
fungal O

This O
suggests O
that O
chronic O
airway O
inflammation O
in O
some O
COPD O
patients O
may O
not O
respond O
to O
anti-inflammatory O
therapies O
alone O
[ O
43 O
] O
unless O
the O
underlying O
bacterial O
infection O
driving O
the O
abnormal O

is O
addressed. O
To O
achieve O
statistical O
power O
for O
a O
genome-wide O
analysis O
associating O
microbiome O
and O
host O
multi-omics O
datasets O
in O
a O
relatively O

sample O

we O
performed O
dimensionality O

used O
multivariate O

to O
identify O
significant O
associations O
between O

composition O
and O

patterns O
of O
host O
gene O

Similar O
approaches O
were O
employed O
by O
Morgan O
et O

in O
associating O
gut O
microbiome O
with O
host O
transcriptome O
in O
inflammatory O

patients O
[ O

The O
strong O
correlations O
of O
Haemophilus O
and O
Moraxella O
with O
host O
immune O
and O

tPCs O
and O

highlight O
the O
positive O
links O
between O
the O
two O
genera O
and O
host O
immune O
responses O
that O
predominated O
airway O
host-microbiome O
interactions. O
The O
presence O
of O
lipopolysaccharide-induced O
bronchial O
epithelial O
receptors O
among O
the O
top O
loadings O
demonstrates O
that O
our O
approach O
can O
recapitulate O
an O
active O
host-bacterial O
crosstalk O
in O
COPD. O
While O
both O
Haemophilus O
and O
Moraxella O
were O
positively O
associated O
with O
T-cell O
induced O
pro-inflammatory O
signaling, O
the O
interferon O
signaling O
was O
more O
strongly O
linked O
to O
Moraxella O
than O
Haemophilus. O
This O
is O
consistent O
with O
one O
previous O
study O
showing O
that O
M. B-PATH
catarrhalis I-PATH
but O
not O
H. B-PATH
influenzae I-PATH
induced O
interferon-beta O
expression O
in O
bronchial O

[ O

] O
and O
aligns O
with O
the O
different O
pathogenicity O
profiles O
between O
the O
two O
pathogens O
[ O
45 O
]. O
Differential O
involvement O
of O
viral O
co-infection O
could O
be O
another O
important O
factor O
[ O
46 O
]. O
We O
have O
not O
fully O
characterized O
the O
sputum O
viral O
load O
of O
this O
cohort O
due O
to O
limited O
sputum O
available. O
Additional O
viral O
load O
data O
is O
key O
to O
further O
resolving O
this O
question. O
Our O
multivariate O
analysis O
showed O
that O
Megasphaera O
and O
an O
unknown O
genus O
in O
S24–7 O
family O
were O
associated O
with O
reduced O
expression O
of O
host O
inflammatory O
pathways O
and O
therefore O
could O
potentially O
reverse O
airway O
inflammation O
(i.e. O

Sugar O
and O
protein O
supplementation O
did O
not O
enhance O
the O
cryopreservation O
outcome O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
sugar O
and O
protein O
already O
circulating O
in O
the O
blood O
and O
extracellular O
compartments O
of O
the O

24 O
. O
However, O
a O
dose-response O
study O
was O
not O
conducted O
for O
the O
protein O
supplementation, O
nor O
for O
particular O
extender O
components; O
therefore O
refinement O
of O
such O
parameters O
might O
further O
improve O
the O
viability O
rates O
observed O
in O
the O
present O
study. O
The O
vitrification O
methodology O
used O
in O
this O
study O
has O
recently O
started O
to O
attract O
many O
cryobiologists O
as O
it O
outperforms O
freezing O
in O
several O
key O
aspects: O
(1) O
time-effectiveness O
since O
the O
preparation O
of O
samples O
is O
faster, O
several O
samples O
can O
be O
manipulated O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
and O
the O
cooling O
itself O
is O
radically O
faster; O
(2) O
low O
volumes O
of O
lN O
2 O
needed O
25 O
, O
26 O
. O
Needle O
immersed O
vitrification O
(NIV) O
is O
especially O
significant O
as O
it O
allows O
the O
manipulation O
of O
several O
tissue O
pieces O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
but O
also O
enables O
a O
direct O
contact O
between O
the O
tissue O
and O
liquid O
nitrogen O
thus O
increasing O
the O
cooling O
and O
warming O
rates O
as O
well O
as O
reducing O
the O
amount O
and O
concentration O
of O
cryoprotectants O
needed O
26 O
– O
28 O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
compared O
to O
the O
freezing O
protocols, O
vitrification O
does O
need O
significantly O
higher O
concentrations O
of O
cryoprotectants O
to O
enable O
the O
transition O
to O
the O
glassy O
amorphous O
state O
which O
in O
turn O
may O
be O
toxic O
to O
the O
cells O
29 O
. O
Combining O
two O
cryoprotectants O
in O
similar O
concentrations O
enables O
the O
use O
of O
high O
overall O
cryoprotectant O
concentrations, O
however, O
each O
of O
them O
is O
in O
low O
enough O
amount O
to O
avoid O
toxicity O
to O
the O
cells O
25 O
. O
The O
protocol O
using O
3 O
M O
Me O
2 O
SO O
and O
3 O
M O
PG O
in O
the O
VS O
yielded O
the O
highest O
spermatogonia O
viability, O
similarly O
to O
the O
reports O
of O
Lujić O
et O
al. O
25 O
. O
Additionally, O
vitrification O
displayed O
one O
significant O
advantage O
over O
the O
freezing O
protocols O
since O
far O
less O
spermatozoa O
were O
observed O
after O
vitrification. O
Most O
likely, O
spermatozoa O
do O
not O
survive O
the O
vitrification O
process, O
get O
digested O
during O
the O
enzymatic O
treatment O
and O
therefore O
the O
suspensions O
are O
enriched O
for O
spermatogonial O
stem O
cells. O

For O
the O

the O
second O
most O

was O
either O
the O
second O
or O
third O
choice O
for O
nearly O
half O
the O
respondents O
and O
was O
selected O
in O
all O

Disease O
resistance O
was O
a O
high O
priority O
for O
those O
producers O
who O
had O
problems O
with O
specific O
plant O
pathogens. O
These O
were O
concentrated O
in O
areas O
of O
the O

were O
all O
identified O

However, O
these O
traits O
might O
be O
a O
priority O
for O
livestock O

However, O
this O

In O

Introduction O
A O
growing O
body O
of O
literature O
supports O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
many O
morbidities O
associated O
with O
prematurity O
are O
sex-specific O
1 O
. O
An O
increased O
risk O
of O
respiratory O
morbidity, O
including O
bronchopulmonary O
dysplasia O
(BPD), O
has O
been O
noted O
in O
preterm O
males O
2 O
– O
4 O
. O
Although O
genetic, O
developmental O
and O
hormonal O
differences O
between O
male O
and O
females O
have O
been O
identified, O
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
the O
increased O
respiratory O
morbidity O
observed O
in O
preterm O
male O
infants O
are O
unclear. O
The O
pathogenesis O
of O
BPD O
is O
multifactorial. O
Both O
clinical O
and O
pre-clinical O
data O
support O
a O
role O
played O
by O
oxidant O
and O
inflammatory O
stress O
in O
mediating O
neonatal O
lung O
injury O
and O
subsequent O
abnormal O
development O
5 O
– O
10 O
. O
Of O
note, O
pre-clinical O
data O
have O
begun O
to O
unravel O
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
sex-type O
specific O
responses O
to O
neonatal O
hyperoxia O
exposure. O
Compared O
to O
female O
mice, O
neonatal O
male O
mice O
were O
more O
susceptible O
to O
early O
postnatal O
hyperoxia-induced O
lung O
injury O
and O
abnormal O
lung O
development O
11 O
. O
This O
injury O
was O
associated O
with O
markers O
of O
differential O
NFκB O
activity O
between O
male O
and O
female O
mice. O
Work O
from O
this O
same O
group O
demonstrated O
evidence O
of O
increased O
hyperoxia-induced O
NFκB O
activity O
in O
human O
umbilical O
vein O
endothelial O
cells O
derived O
from O
female O
donors O
12 O
. O
These O
data O
are O
consistent O
with O
previous O
reports O
demonstrating O
that O
in O
response O
to O
hyperoxia, O
NFκB O
activity O
is O

VitB6 O
is O
a O
collective O
term O
for O
a O
group O
of O
six O
interconvertible O
compounds O
1 O
, O
7 O
. O
It O
is O
most O
notable O
for O
its O
contribution O
to O
amino O
acid, O
carbohydrate O
and O
fatty O
acid O
metabolism O
where O
it O
serves O
as O
a O
cofactor O
for O
enzymes O
48 O
. O
Despite O
these O
facts, O
the O
effect O
of O
VitB6 O
on O
plant O
development, O
the O
mechanisms O
controlling O
its O
biosynthesis O
and O
stress O
tolerance O
are O
still O
poorly O
understood. O
Reactive O
oxygen O
species O
(ROS) O
quenching O
and O
antioxidant O
properties O
by O
VitB6 O
have O
been O
an O
extensively O
studied O
phenomenon. O
VitB6 O
vitamers O
have O
been O
affirmed O
as O
significant O
singlet O
oxygen O
quenchers O
in O

49 O
. O
Nevertheless, O
well O
documented O
in O
A. O
thaliana, O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
assessed O
for O
its O
definitive O
role O
50 O
. O
Further, O
PDX1.2 O
serves O
its O
role O
in O
sustaining O
VitB6 O
under O
critical O
conditions O
and O
stabilizes O

The O
literature O
available O
for O
most O
of O
the O
crop O

shows O
the O
manifestation O
of O
both O
de O

and O
salvage O
pathways O
in O
VitB6 O
genes O
for O
enhanced O
disease O

upon O

infection. O
Recently, O
Zhang O
et O
al. O
52 O
proved O
that O
Botrytis O
cinerea-infected O
tomato O
plants O
show O
the O
involvement O
of O
the O
de O

vitB6 O
biosynthetic O
pathway O
and O
not O
salvage O

by O
affirming O
SlPDX1.2 O
and O
SlPDX1.3 O
genes O
but O
not O
SlSOS4 O
through O

based O
on O
disease O
severity. O
Also, O
Ralstonia O
solani O
RsolPDX1, O
RsolPDX2, O
and O
RsolPLR O
were O
the O
three O
principal O
factors O
involved O
in O
the O
VitB6 O

in O
R. O
solani O
AG3 O
53 O
. O
Most O
of O
the O
literature O
pertaining O
to O
VitB6 O
biosynthesis O
addresses O
de O

pathway O
mostly O
but O
salvage O
pathway O
at O
rare O
circumstances, O
interestingly O
lack O
of O
introns O
were O
denoted O
for O
plant-pathogen O

18 O
. O
Hence, O
we O
could O
not O
clearly O
find O
a O
gap O
in O
abridging O

in O

(M7769-5MG, O

Mice O
were O

(Wizard O

Consequently, O
the O
estimates O
of O
friction O
costs O
should O
represent O
the O
upper O
bound O
of O
the O
estimates O
of O
the O
short-term O
indirect O
costs O
[ O
27 O
]. O
However, O
in O
cases O
involving O
teamwork, O
the O
absence O
of O
an O
employee O
can O
also O
reduce O
the O
production O
of O
several O
employees O
[ O
39 O
]. O
Fifth, O
although O
the O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
exclude O
the O
costs O
of O
reinfection, O
the O
women O
who O
were O
symptomatic O
at O
2 O
weeks O
might O
have O
experienced O
a O
reinfection O
between O
the O
second O
and O
the O
eighth O
weeks, O
and O
these O
costs O
were O
taken O
into O
account O
because O
differences O
between O
relapses O
and O
reinfections O
could O
not O
be O
identified O
during O
this O
period. O
Sixth, O
the O
costs O
of O
long-term O
symptomatic O
failure O
(i.e., O
the O
persistence O
of O
symptoms O
after O
8 O
weeks) O
could O
not O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
because O
the O
follow-up O
period O
stopped O
after O
8 O
weeks. O
Seventh, O
from O
the O
patient O
perspective, O
the O
costs O
could O
have O
been O
overestimated O
because O
some O
companies O
might O
have O
paid O
their O
employees O
during O
their O
sick O
leaves; O
or O
these O
costs O
could O
also O
have O
been O
underestimated O
because O
there O
were O
no O
data O
from O
which O
excess O
fees O
for O
medical O
imaging O
procedures O
could O
be O
assessed. O
Another O
point O
from O
the O
patient O
perspective O
is O
the O
costs O
of O
over O
the O
counter O
drugs, O
which O
could O
not O
still O
have O
been O
accounted O
for O
because O
costs O
differ O
between O
retail O
outlets. O
None O
of O
these O
data O
were O
available. O
As O
last O
limitation, O
the O
results O
of O
diagnostic O
tests O
prescribed O
by O
physicians O
were O
not O
collected. O
According O
to O
Foxman O
[ O
4 O
], O
10.8 O
% O
of O
women O
over O
18 O
years O
of O
age O
experience O
at O
least O
one O
UTI O
per O
year, O
which O
represents O
more O
than O
2.5 O
million O
people O
in O
France O
as O
of O
1 O
January O
2012 O
[ O
40 O
]. O
In O
our O
study, O
the O
estimated O
number O
of O
women O
who O
visited O
a O
GP O
for O
a O
UTI O
was O
estimated O
to O
832,073 O
(95 O
% O
CI O
= O
623,614–1,040,532) O
in O
2012. O
However, O
the O
rate O
of O
care O
seeking O
for O
UTIs O
in O
France O
is O
unknown. O
Some O
women O
with O
UTI O
symptoms O
might O
have O
spontaneously O
recovered O
healed O
[ O
41 O
], O
visited O
other O
specialists O
(e.g., O
gynecologists O
and O
urologists) O
or O
emergency O
departments. O

The O
analyses O
of O
biochemical O
data O
and O
FT-Raman O
cluster O
analysis O
confirmed O
that O
after O
wounding O
the O
reaction O
of O
rcd1 O
and O
aos O
mutants O
differed O
the O
most O
compared O
to O
wild O
type O
(Fig. O
2 O
c). O
The O
measurements O
of O
various O
hormone O
contents, O
and O
reactive O
oxygen O
species, O
in O
leaves O
of O
those O
mutants O
in O
further O
studies O
could O
be O
helpful O
to O
elucidate O
the O
observed O
results. O
The O
recent O
studies O
by O
Machado O
et O
al. O
( O
2015 O
) O
indicated O
that O
jasmonates O
might O
be O
an O
important O
regulator O
of O
leaf O
carbohydrate O
accumulation O
(in O
Nicotiana O
plants); O
diurnal, O
jasmonate-dependent O
inhibition O
of O
invertase O
activity O
as O
possible O
control O
mechanism O
was O
suggested. O
In O
our O
study O
aos O
mutant O
of O
Arabidopsis O
exhibited O
generally O
lower O
activity O
of O
invertases O
(thus O
higher O
sucrose O
content) O
and O
higher O
SuSy O
activity O
than O
other O
mutants. O
However, O
our O
study O
indicates O
that O
complexity O
of O
interactions O
of O
hormonal O
imbalance O
(in O
mutants) O
and O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
sugar O
metabolism O
during O
wounding O
stress O
requires O
further O
investigation. O
In O
conclusion, O
our O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
modification O
of O
stress O
hormones O
content/sensitivity O
in O
rcd1, O
aos O
and O
ein4 O
mutants O
of O
A. O
thaliana O
affects O
sugar O
production/metabolism O
in O
plants. O
So O
far, O
carbohydrate O
metabolism O
has O
not O
been O
studied O
in O
those O
mutants, O
and O
to O
our O
knowledge, O
the O
role O
of O
jasmonates O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
sugar O
metabolism O
was O
also O
unknown. O
Mutants O
reactions O
related O
to O
basic O
metabolic O
processes-photosynthesis O
and O
respiration-differed O
significantly O
from O
those O
observed O
in O
wild-type O
plants. O
In O
the O
study O
described, O
wound O
responses O
of O
the O
mutants O
with O
reduced O
sensitivity O
to O
MeJA, O
ABA O
and O
ethylene O
(rcd1, O
Ahlfors O
et O
al. O
2004 O
), O
and O
JA-deficient O
(aos) O
were O
usually O
different O
than O
those O
of O
the O
wild-type O
plants. O
The O
activity O
of O
cytosolic O
enzymes O
(CIN, O
SuSy) O
involved O
in O
sucrose O
metabolism O
was O
also O
high O
in O
the O
rcd1 O
and O
aos O
mutants; O
the O
high O
activity O
of O
sugar O
metabolism O
enzymes O
after O
injury O
of O
leaves O
only O
partially O
correlated O
with O
measured O
sugars O
content. O

Immunodeficiencies O
do O
occur, O
but O
are O
less O
common. O
Pulmonary O
Disease O
Relatively O
common. O
Less O
common. O
Cancer O
Although O
malignancies O
in O
these O
individuals O
tend O
to O
occur O
at O
a O
younger O
age O
and O
are O
often O
lymphoid O
in O
nature, O
cancers O
in O
older O
individuals O
do O
occur O
and O
include O
both O
hematopoietic O
and O
non-hematopoietic O
malignancies. O
Malignancies O
tend O
to O
appear O
later O
in O
life O
and O
include O
a O
higher O
proportion O
of O
non-hematopoietic O
cancers. O
The O
diagnosis O
of O
cancer O
can O
precede O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
A-T. O
Certain O
missense O
mutations, O
in-frame O
mutations O
or O
leaky O
splice-site O
mutations O
allow O
for O
the O
production O
of O
residual O
amounts O
of O
functioning O
ATM O
protein O
[ O
97 O
]. O
ATM O
protein O
can O
be O
detected O
on O
western O
blots O
and O
some O
level O
of O
kinase O
activity O
is O
present. O
Individuals O
who O
possess O
these O
types O
of O
ATM O
mutations O
have O
traditionally O
been O
referred O
to O
as O
“atypical” O
or O
“variant,” O
and O
more O
recently O
as O
“mild.” O
Because O
there O
is O
some O
degree O
of O
residual O
ATM O
function, O
from O
either O
normal O
or O
mutant O
protein, O
the O
overall O
severity O
of O
their O
clinical O
course O
is O
less, O
and O
the O
progression O
of O
their O
disease O
is O
slower O
(Table O
3 O
). O
Of O
note, O
in O
the O
mild O
form O
of O
the O
disease, O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
cancer O
can O
precede O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
A-T O
[ O
100 O
, O
101 O
]. O
As O
radiation O
therapy O
and O
radiomimetic O
chemotherapy O
can O
be O
especially O
cytotoxic O
in O
individuals O
with O
this O
disease, O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
A-T O
should O
be O
considered O
for O
any O
individual O
with O
cancer O
who O
has O
an O
undiagnosed O
disorder O
associated O
with O
gait O
disturbance O
or O
eye O
movement O
abnormality, O
especially O
if O
the O
symptoms O
are O
progressive. O
Mild O
cases O
also O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
present O
with O
neurological O
symptoms O
in O
adulthood O
versus O
childhood O
[ O
95 O
, O
102 O
– O
105 O
]; O
however, O
in O
at O
least O
one O
case O
report O
the O
authors O
could O
not O
definitively O
rule O
out O
the O
possibility O
that O
mild O
neurological O
abnormalities O
existed O
in O
childhood O
[ O
102 O
]. O
Interestingly, O
three O
documented O
“null” O
milds O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
literature O
[ O
77 O
, O
106 O
]. O
The O

that O

are O
critical O
for O

After O

The O
discrepancy O
may O
suggest O
that O
the O
regulatory O

AirR O
is O

Why O
AirSR O
acts O
differently O
in O

still O

clear. O
Our O
speculation O
is O
that O
inactivation O

may O
contribute O
to O
the O

of O

But O
this O
speculation O
needs O
further O
study. O
WalKR O

an O

TCS O
that O

[ O

Alterations O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
WalKR O
as O

as O

can O
lead O
to O
a O
change O
in O

to O
vancomycin O
[ O
19 O
, O
30 O
]. O
AirSR O
and O
WalKR O
exhibit O
similar O
functions. O
Our O
microarray O
data O
indicate O
that O
the O
WalKR O
expression O
level O
is O
unchanged O
in O
the O
airSR O
mutant, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
report O
so O
far O
that O
WalKR O
regulates O
AirSR, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
two O
TCSs O
may O
regulate O
cell O

independently. O
Conclusions O
The O
airSR O

exhibited O
reduced O
autolysis O

down-regulation O
in O
many O
cell O
wall O
metabolism-related O
genes O
in O

All O
these O
operons O
had O
the O

gene O
order O
and O
were O
associated O
with O
a O
gene O
for O

To O
date, O
the O
SpaCBA O

have O
been O
found O
mainly O
in O
the O
L. O

group O
and O
much O
less O
frequently O
in O
other O
lactobacilli O
(Aleksandrzak-Piekarczyk O
et O

2016 O
). O
However, O
despite O
possessing O
complete O
pili O
operons, O
some O
L. O
casei O
strains O
do O
not O
form O
pili O
due O
to O
variations O
in O
the O
spaCBA O
sequence O
(Toh O
et O

) O
or O
its O

functional O

and O
− O
10 O
sequences O
(Aleksandrzak-Piekarczyk O
et O

). O
In O
contrast O
to O
L. O
casei, O
in O
L. O
rhamnosus O
GG, O
the O
orthologous O
pili O
gene O
cluster O
is O

mucus-binding O
ability O
(Kankainen O
et O
al. O

; O
Reunanen O

2012 O
). O
Also O
the O
plasmidic O
spaCBA O
from O
L. O
paracasei O
LOCK O
0919 O
seems O
to O
be O
functional O
and O
responsible O
for O
the O
strong O
adhesiveness O
of O
this O
strain O
(Aleksandrzak-Piekarczyk O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
It O
is O
postulated O
that O
insertion O
of O
an O

in O
the O
spaC O
promoter O
region O
in O
both O
L. O

LOCK O
0919 O
allows O
the O

of O
the O
pili O
genes O
(Douillard O
et O
al. O
2013 O
; O
Aleksandrzak-Piekarczyk O
et O

). O
Notably, O
the O
upstream O
region O
of O
the O
IBB3423 O
spaCBA O
operon O
harbored O
by O
pLCAKO.2 O
also O
contains O
an O
insertion O
element O
indicating O
that O
it O
likely O
is O
functional. O
Indeed, O
the O
removal O
of O
pLCAKO.2 O
led O
to O
a O
marked O
decrease O
of O
IBB3423 O
hydrophobicity O
and O
adhesiveness O
to O
biotic O
and O
abiotic O
surfaces. O
The O
presence O
of O
such O
a O
plasmid O
should O
therefore O
facilitate O
colonization O
and O
ensure O
longer O
persistence O
in O
the O
host’s O
gut O
thereby O
conferring O
a O
competitive O
advantage O
over O
other O
bacteria. O
It O
can O
also O
increase O
the O
range O
of O
inhabited O
environments. O

This O
view O
has O
previously O
been O
reported O
in O
ethnographic O
and O
anthropological O
works O
(Neurath O
2002 O
, O
2016 O
; O
Medina-Miranda O
2017 O
; O
Villegas O
2016 O
), O
and O
does O
not O
focus O
specifically O
on O
mushrooms. O
There O
was O
a O
story O
known O
among O
the O
Wixaritari O
people O
older O
than O
70 O
years, O
that O
God O
decides O
which O
mushrooms O
were O
suitable O
for O
human O
consumption; O
this O
arises O
from O
the O
idea O
that O
mushrooms O
are O
a O
divine O
gift O
and O
food O
that O
saves O
people O
from O
dying O
of O
hunger. O
This O
recalls O
the O
Lacandon O
myth O
in O
which O
God O
decides O
what O
can O
and O
cannot O
be O
eaten O
(Ruan-Soto O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
However, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Wixaritari, O
this O
idea O
formed O
part O
of O

CONCLUSIONS O
The O
Wixaritari O
and O
mestizos, O
two O
cultural O
groups O
in O
the O
same O
geographic O
region O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
same O
natural O
resources, O
presented O
differences O
in O
their O
conceptions O
and O
perceptions O
of O
mushrooms O
and O
in O
their O
use O
and O
understanding. O
These O
disparities O
reflected O
their O
distinct O
views O
of O
life. O
In O
both O
groups, O
mushrooms O
formed O
part O
of O
different O
social O
and O
cultural O
traditions O
and, O
for O
example, O
were O
eaten O
as O
food, O
used O
in O
games, O
and O
also O
formed O
part O
of O
different O
legends. O
Overall, O
mushrooms O
were O
valued O
and O
understood O
according O
to O
the O
worldview O
of O
each O
group. O
The O
mestizo O
groups O
perceived O
and O
recognized O
the O
mushrooms O
nearby O
where O
they O
carried O
out O
their O
daily O
activities. O
The O
indigenous O
Wixaritari, O
in O
contrast, O
recognized O
and O
used O
a O
greater O
diversity O
of O
mushrooms O
whether O
they O
lived O
in O
forested O
areas O
or O
ones O
of O
disturbed O
natural O
vegetation. O
However, O
both O
groups O
had O
undergone O
cultural O
and O
social O
changes O
resulting O
in O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
knowledge O
and O
use O
of O
some O
mushrooms O
species. O
Social O
modernization, O
especially O
the O
replacement O
of O
natural O
resources O
by O
cultivated O
ones, O
and O
modification O
of O
traditions O
had O
led O
to O
an O
interruption O
in O
the O
transmission O
of O
traditional O
knowledge. O
This O
process O
was O
also O
linked O
to O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
sense O
of O
belonging O
to O
certain O
natural O
ecosystems. O
We O
found O
evidence O
of O
changes O
in O
the O
level O
of O
traditional O
knowledge, O
implying O
changes O
to O
the O
degree O
of O
mycophilia. O

However, O
it O

known O
whether O
Pestoides O

able O
to O
stably O

pPCP1 O
and O

To O
test O
this, O
we O
introduced O
a O
kanamycin-marked O
pPCP1 O
derived O
from O

(ref. O

) O
into O
the O
pCD1 O

of O
Pestoides O
F. O
To O
ensure O
that O
this O
marked O
version O
of O
pPCP1 O
did O
not O
affect O
its O

we O
reintroduced O
the O

back O
into O
the O
pCD1 O

and O

in O
all O
cases, O
the O

was O
subsequently O
excised O
by O

To O
test O
the O
ability O
of O
Pestoides O
F O
to O
carry O
pPCP1, O
we O
measured O
the O
copy O
number O
of O
the O
pla O
and O
pst O
genes O
(both O
encoded O
on O
pPCP1) O
in O
Pestoides O
F O
relative O
to O
that O
in O
CO92 O
and O
Δpla O
CO92 O
carrying O
the O
reintroduced O
pPCP1. O
The O
copy O
number O
of O
pPCP1 O
carried O
by O
wild-type O
CO92 O
and O
the O
unmarked, O
reintroduced O
pPCP1 O
in O
CO92 O
are O
similar, O
indicating O
that O
the O

left O
by O
removal O
of O
the O
antibiotic O
cassette O
has O
no O
effect O
on O
plasmid O
replication O
( O

In O
addition, O
we O
found O
that O
Pestoides O
F O
naturally O
maintains O
pPCP1 O
without O
antibiotic O
selection O
(albeit O
at O
a O
higher O
relative O

Furthermore, O
neither O

A O

Probiotics O
have O
the O

diminish O
the O

Importantly, O
most O

Therefore, O

In O
brief, O
the O

fields O

will O
help O

Conclusion O
The O
heterogeneous O
nature O
of O
HNSCCs O
has O
hindered O
the O
identification O
of O
specific O
targets O
for O
the O
development O
of O
targeted O
therapies. O
Over O
the O
past O
30 O
years O
we O
have O
developed O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
the O
genomic, O
proteomic, O
microbiomic O
and O
metabolomic O
alterations O
in O
HNSCCs. O
This O
knowledge O
is O
helping O
to O
move O
us O
closer O
to O
personalised O
therapy, O
where O
each O
subtype O
can O
be O
treated O
as O
a O
separate O
disease. O

Oxylipin O
pathways O
in O
both O
plant O
and O
fungal O
partners O
can O
play O
crucial O
roles O
in O
mediating O
the O
crosstalk O
between O
many O
plant O
hosts O
and O
their O
fungal O
pathogens, O
which O
can O
determine O
the O
eventual O
outcome O
of O
the O
pathogenesis O
process O
[ O
23 O
, O
96 O
– O
98 O
]. O
In O
several O
cases O
in O
plants O
it O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
CLO/PXG O
peroxygenase O
activity O
plays O
a O
direct O
role O
in O
plant O
responses O
to O
fungal O
pathogens. O
Examples O
include O
the O
response O
of O
wheat O
plants O
to O
infection O
by O
the O
pathogens, O
Puccinia O
graminis O
and O
P. O
stritiformis, O
where O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
host-pathogen O
co-expression O
network O
during O
infection O
of O
wheat O
plants O
[ O
10 O
, O
97 O
, O
98 O
]. O
Plant O
lipid O
droplets O
(LDs) O
are O
both O
one O
of O
the O
major O
subcellular O
sites O
of O
CLO/PXG O
accumulation O
and O
also O
contain O
oxylipins O
that O
are O
involved O
in O
anti-fungal O
defences O
[ O
31 O
, O
99 O
– O
101 O
]. O
In O
line O
with O
this, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
A. O
flavus O
AfPXG O
has O
peroxygenase O
activity O
and O
mediates O
fungal O
development O
and O
aflatoxin O
production O
[ O
82 O
]. O
A O
more O
recent O
report O
has O
shown O
that O
the O
AfPXG-deficient O
line O
resulted O
in O
a O
fungal O
phenotype O
characterized O
with O
a O
severe O
decrease O
in O
mycelium O
growth, O
failure O
in O
sporulation O
and O
a O
reduced O
level O
of O
aflatoxin. O
Inversely, O
the O
line O
that O
overexpressed O
AfPXG, O
with O
the O
reporter O
gene O
Gfp O
exhibited O
an O
elevated O
numbers O
of O
stable O
lipid O
droplets O
(LDs) O
plus O
enhanced O
aflatoxin O
levels O
[ O
3 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
transcriptomic O
profile O
of O
Blumeria O
graminis O
f. O
sp. O
tritici O
showed O
that O
a O
Ca O
+ O
2 O
-binding O
protein O
is O
involved O
in O
fungal O
conidiation O
[ O

]. O
Also, O
a O
similar O
situation O
was O
observed O
in O
Metarhizium O

[ O

. O
Here O
we O
present O
Met-Flow, O
a O
high-parameter O
flow O
cytometry O
method O
utilizing O
antibodies O
against O
metabolic O
proteins O
that O
are O
critical O
and O
rate-limiting O
in O
their O
representative O
pathways. O
The O
cell’s O
capacity O
to O
flux O
through O
anabolic O
pathways O
was O
examined O
by O
the O
measurement O
of O
fatty-acid O
synthesis O
and O
an O
arginine O
metabolism O
protein. O
The O
catabolic O
pathways O
encompassed O
quantification O
of O
proteins O
involved O
in O
glycolysis, O
the O
pentose O
phosphate O
pathway O
(PPP), O
tricarboxylic O
acid O
(TCA) O
cycle, O
OXPHOS, O
and O
fatty-acid O
oxidation. O
The O
capacity O
for O
phosphate O
and O
glucose O
uptake O
was O
measured O
by O
expression O
levels O
of O
metabolic O
transporters O
and O
an O
antioxidant O
enzyme O
that O
affects O
oxidative O
stress. O
The O
protein O
composition O
of O
these O
rate-limiting O
enzymes O
defines O
the O
cellular O
capacity O
of O
metabolic O
pathways. O
Furthermore, O
dynamic O
cellular O
differentiation O
engages O
rapid O
post-transcriptional O
and O
post-translational O
mechanisms, O
thus O
affecting O
concentrations O

metabolic O

Met-Flow O
allows O
simultaneous O
capturing O
of O
the O
state O
of O
key O
metabolic O
pathways O
on O
a O
single-cell, O
protein O
level, O
thus O
overcoming O
inherent O
drawbacks O
of O
metabolic O
mRNA O
analysis, O
including O
the O
temporal O
discord O
between O
mRNA O
abundance O
with O
protein O
concentration O
14 O
. O
Moreover, O
dynamic O
cellular O
differentiation O
engages O
rapid O
post-transcriptional O
and O
post-translational O
mechanisms, O
which O
are O
not O
regulated O
by O
gene O
expression O
15 O
. O
Combined, O
these O
limitations O
highlight O
the O
importance O
of O
protein-level O
analysis. O
We O
demonstrate O
the O
ability O
of O
Met-Flow O
to O
measure O
divergent O
metabolic O
states O
across O
healthy O
human O
peripheral O

mononuclear O

(PBMCs) O
and O
draw O
associations O
between O
the O
metabolic O
profile O
of O
a O
cell O
with O
its O
subset O
phenotype, O
activation O
status, O
and O
immunological O
function. O
With O
the O
ability O
to O
capture O
metabolic O
heterogeneity O
on O
a O
single-cell O
level, O
Met-Flow O
provides O
important O
insights O
into O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
metabolic O

across O
any O

type. O

The O

(Panziera O

such O

hygienic O

or O

including O
the O
study O
by O
Panziera O
et O
al. O
( O
2017 O
), O
who O
used O
exactly O
the O
approach O
outlined O
in O
this O
article. O

In O
contrast O
with O
the O
Mazatec O
people, O
the O
Wixaritari O
woman O
was O
able O
to O
maintain O
permanent O
communication O
with O
the O
divine O
being O
after O
eating O
mushrooms O
only O
once. O
This O
case O
accords O
with O
the O
Wixaritari O
credence O
in O
which O
gifts, O
including O
healing, O
are O
imparted O
at O
birth O
or O
acquired O
through O
a O
process O
of O
shamanic O
initiation O
(Neurath O
2000 O
), O
in O
this O
case O
by O
eating O
mushrooms. O
The O
term O
of O
“entheogenic” O
has O
been O
applied O
to O
psychoactive O
mushrooms O
used O
as O
magical-religious O
agents O
(Ruck O
et O
al. O
1979 O
). O
Etymologically, O
entheogenic O
signifies O
“that O
which O
contains O
God O
or O
God O
within”. O
However, O
when O
the O
elderly O
woman O
ate O
the O
mushrooms, O
they O
were O
not O
viewed O
as O
necessarily O
containing O
God, O
but O
allowed O
her O
to O
establish O
communication O
with O
the O
divine O
beings. O
This O
is O
why O
we O
decided O
to O
use O
the O
term O
hierophanic, O
meaning O
“something O
sacred O
that O
is O
shown O
to O
us” O
(Eliade O
1981 O
). O
Hierophanies O
are O
manifestations O
of O
God O
or O
contact O
with O
God. O
This O
phenomenon O
is O
seen O
in O
other O
countries O
where O
neurotropic O
mushrooms O
are O
also O
used O
in O
rituals O
to O
establish O
a O
connection O
with O
sacred O
beings, O
yet O
the O
mushrooms O
do O
not O
represent O
or O
contain O
God. O
For O
example, O
in O
Siberia, O
Amanita O
muscaria O
is O
used O
to O
communicate O
with O
the O
souls O
of O
the O
dead O
and O
spirits O
in O
addition O
to O
treating O
illnesses, O
finding O
solutions O
to O
problems, O
and O
viewing O
the O
past, O
among O
other O
attributes O
(Saar O
1991 O
). O
In O
Oaxaca, O
the O
Chinantec O
people O
ingest O
species O
of O
Psilocybe O
to O
diagnose O
animals, O
locate O
objects, O
or O
to O
establish O
communication O
with O
a O
deceased O
loved O
one. O
The O
Mazatec O
and O
Chatino O
peoples O
say O
they O
can O
also O
see O
and O
speak O
with O
God O
after O
ingesting O
mushrooms O
(Guzmán O
2016 O
). O
Wixarika O
conceptions O
of O
mushrooms O
For O
the O
Wixaritari, O
mushrooms O
have O
divine O
connotations, O
autonomy, O
and O
feelings O
that O
make O
them O
similar O
to O
people. O
They O
consider O
mushrooms O
are O
able O
to O
breathe O
and O
to O
feel O
sadness, O
pain, O
or O
happiness, O
in O
addition O
to O
being O
able O
to O
see O
and O
perceive O
what O
occurs O
around O
them, O
which O
is O
expressed O
through O
changes O
in O
their O
physical O
state. O

Koalas O
were O
considered O
to O
have O
a O
new O
urogenital O
tract O
infection O
if O
they O
were O
Chlamydia-negative O
at O
their O
preceding O
clinical O
examination O
less O
than O
3 O
months O
previously, O
while O
koalas O
who O
were O
considered O
to O
have O
long-term O
(chronic) O
infections O
had O
urogenital O
tract O
infections O
at O
multiple O
consecutive O
clinical O
examinations O
over O
a O
period O
of O
more O
than O
3 O
months. O
In O
addition, O
after O
this O
initial O
decline O
in O
infection O
load O
after O
the O
first O
3 O
months, O
there O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
a O
significant O
trend O
in O
infection O
levels O
over O
time O
for O
koalas O
with O
long-term O
urogenital O
tract O
infections O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O

Disease O
progression O
was O
not O
influenced O
by O
sex O
or O
age O
There O
was O
no O

difference O
in O
the O

with O
different O

outcomes O
(Kruskal-Wallis O

(Supplementary O

In O
addition, O
although O
91% O
(10/11) O
of O
koalas O
that O
were O
able O
to O
resolve O
an O
infection O
were O
female, O
and O
only O
9% O
(1/11) O
were O
male, O
the O
difference O
between O
the O

in O
their O
ability O
to O

an O
infection O
was O
not O
statistically O
significant O
(two-tailed O

Only O

Further, O
the O
geographical O

quite O

Introduction O
Salmonella B-PATH
enterica I-PATH
serovar B-PATH
Typhimurium I-PATH
(S. O
Typhimurium) O
infects O
both O
animal O
and O
human O
hosts, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
diseases, O
including O
enteric O
fever, O
gastroenteritis, O
bacteraemia O
and O
systemic O
infection. O
S. O
Typhimurium O
is O
mainly O
transmitted O
by O
contaminated O
food, O
such O
as O
egg O
and O
its O
products, O
poultry, O
and O
pork. O
In O
mice, O
this O
pathogen O
evokes O
a O
disseminated O
infection O
that O
serves O
as O
a O
model O
for O
human O
typhoid O
fever. O
During O
infection, O
S. O
Typhimurium O
is O
challenged O
by O
various O
physical, O
biochemical, O
or O
cellular O
barriers O
such O
as O
low O
pH, O
bile, O
antimicrobial O
peptides, O

These O
stress O
conditions O
are O
overcome O

including O
those O

However, O
much O

emphasis O
has O
been O
put O
on O
to O
the O
metabolic O
capacities O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium O
as O
a O
prerequisite O
for O
successful O

An O
example O
of O
a O

is O
the O
capability O

to O
use O
myo-inositol O
(MI) O
as O
the O

Background O
Malaria O
is O
responsible O
for O
approximately O
0.5 O
million O
deaths O
every O
year, O
mostly O
affecting O
pregnant O
women O
and O
children O
under O
5 O
years O
of O
age O
[ O
1 O
]. O
The O
development O
of O
drug O
resistance O
against O
standard O
anti-malarial O
therapies O
is O
an O
ongoing O
problem O
and O
this O
has O
necessitated O
the O
use O
of O
combination O
therapies O
in O
certain O
areas O
of O
the O
world. O
Quinine O
has O
been O
used O
previously O
to O
treat O
symptoms O
of O
malaria, O
and O
many O
studies O
have O
found O
that O
the O
clearance O
of O
quinine O
is O
reduced O
in O
humans O
with O
uncomplicated O
Plasmodium B-PATH
falciparum I-PATH
malaria O
[ O
2 O
– O
6 O
]. O
The O
magnitude O
of O
the O
effect O
is O
greater O
in O
patients O
with O
cerebral O
malaria O
and O
is O
also O
correlated O
with O
the O
degree O
of O
parasitaemia O
[ O
4 O
, O
7 O
]. O
As O
such, O
understanding O
the O
effect O
of O
disease O
on O
metabolism O
of O
anti-malarial O
drugs O
is O
important O
to O
ensure O
that O
dosing O
regimens O
are O
appropriate, O
efficacious O
and O
do O
not O
unduly O
foster O
conditions O
that O
may O
select O
for O
drug-resistance. O
Data O
on O
the O
effects O
of O
Plasmodium O
infection O
on O
drug O
metabolizing O
enzymes O
(DMEs) O
are O
sparse. O
However, O
the O
evidence O
collectively O
suggests O
that O
Plasmodium O
infection O
has O
a O
significant O
effect O
on O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
cytochrome O
P450 O
(CYP) O
family O
of O
DMEs. O
CYP3A O
enzymes O
are O
mainly O
responsible O
for O
quinine O
clearance O
via O
its O
3-hydroxylation O
[ O
8 O
], O
indirectly O
suggesting O
that O
expression O
of O
CYP3A O
may O
be O
reduced O
in O
Plasmodium-infected O
individuals. O
A O
study O
of O
caffeine O
clearance O
in O
adult O
male O
patients O
with O
severe O
falciparum O
malaria O
found O
significantly O
reduced O
clearance O
compared O
to O
the O
convalescent O
phase O
[ O
9 O
] O
and O
another O
study O
found O
significantly O
lower O
caffeine O
clearance O
in O
children O
with O
malaria O
compared O
with O
healthy O
controls O
[ O

]. O
Although O
another O
study O
found O
no O
effect O
[ O
11 O
], O
the O
ratio O
of O
paraxanthine O
to O
caffeine, O

CYP1A2 O
activity, O
was O
affected O
more O
than O
total O

[ O

Eleven O
genes O
for O
d O
-adonitol O
metabolism O
(LCAKO_2999 O
to O
LCAKO_3009) O
encode O
components O
of O
a O
mannose-type O
PTS, O
a O
transcriptional O
regulator, O
and O
six O
other O
enzymes O
(Bourand O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Also, O
the O
fos O
operon O
involved O
in O
utilization O
of O
fructo-oligosaccharides O
(FOS), O
such O
as O
inulin, O
and O
the O
transport O
of O
free O
fructose O
(Goh O
et O
al. O
2006 O
) O
was O
identified O
in O
the O
IBB3423 O
genome. O
As O
inulin, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
studied O
prebiotics, O
is O
known O
to O
aid O
the O
development O
of O
desirable O
gastrointestinal O
microflora O
(Kolida O
et O
al. O
2002 O
), O
the O
ability O
to O
metabolize O
it O
is O
a O
very O
important O
property O
of O
probiotic O
bacteria. O
Among O
the O
bacteria O
that O
do O
metabolize O
prebiotic O
oligosaccharides O
are O
some O
strains O
of O
Lactobacillus O
and O
Bifidobacterium O
spp., O
and O
numerous O
in O

and O
in O
vivo O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
their O
growth O
is O
stimulated O
by O
FOS O
or O
other O
oligosaccharides. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
comparing O
with O
the O
control O
strains O
used O
by O
us, O
isolated O
from O
the O
human O
gastrointestinal O
tract, O
IBB3423 O
does O
not O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
ferment O
l O
-rhamnose, O
dulcitol, O
inositol, O
and O
l O
-fucose, O
probably O
due O
to O
their O
low O
abundance O
in O
cow O
milk. O
Interestingly, O
an O
in O
silico O
analysis O
has O
identified O
a O
complete O
myo-inositol O
(MI) O
utilization O
operon O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
the O
probiotic O
L. O
casei O
BL23 B-PATH
strain O
(Yebra O
et O
al. O
2007 O
), O
but O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
non-functional. O
Inositol, O
a O
sugar O
alcohol O
found, O
among O
other O
sources, O
in O
soil, O
is O
used O
for O
phosphate O
storage O
in O

but O
is O
rarely O
used O
as O
an O
energy O
source O
by O
LAB O
(Yebra O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
So O
far, O
only O
some O
strains O
of O
L. O

have O
been O
found O
to O
metabolize O
MI O
with O

Since O
the O

genes O
in O
Saccharomyces O

leads O
to O
increased O

[ O

the O
manipulation O

Given O
our O

the O

and O

[ O

further O
studies O
on O
the O
wider O
roles O
of O
these O

are O
definitely O
merited. O
In O
terms O
of O
the O
origins O
and O
current O
distribution O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
in O
eukaryotes O
we O
suggest O
that O
these O
genes O
were O
present O
in O
the O
last O
eukaryote O
common O
ancestor O
(LECA) O
that O
pre-dated O
the O
split O
into O
the O
major O
extant O
clades O
such O
as O
plants, O
fungi O
and O
Metazoa. O
The O
present O
distribution O
as O
reported O
here O
suggests O
that O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
were O
subsequently O
lost O
in O
all O
eukaryotic O
lineages O
except O
for O
the O
fungal O
and O
plant O
kingdoms. O
The O
presence O
of O
CLO/PXG O
orthologs O
in O
all O
plant O

date O
would O
suggest O
that O
these O
genes O
have O
important O
core O
housekeeping O
functions, O
especially O
in O
the O
land O

In O
contrast, O
the O
more O
patchy O

CLO/PXG O
genes O
amongst O
fungal O
species, O
where O
even O
inside O
many O
genera O
some O

might O
contain O
the O
gene O
while O

do O
not, O
suggests O
that O
CLO/PXG O
is O
more O
of O
an O

gene O
in O
the O

that O
may O
be O

Introduction O
Small O
grains O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
many O
organic O
farming O
systems O
(Lampkin O
1990 O
; O
Wijnands O
1999 O
; O
Lazor O
2013 O
). O
They O
can O
be O
added O
into O
crop O
rotations O
to O
help O
break O
pest, O
weed, O
and O
disease O
cycles, O
and O
to O
enhance O
the O
biodiversity O
of O
the O
system O
(Mohler O
and O
Johnson O
2009 O
). O
Because O
they O
are O
relatively O
low-cost, O
low-input, O
and O
low-risk O
compared O
with O
other O
organic O
crops, O
small O
grains O
can O
be O
extremely O
beneficial O
to O
growers O
(Wiersma O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Small O
grains O
help O
to O
promote O
soil O
aggregation O
more O
than O
many O
cash O
crops, O
which O
contributes O
to O
the O
overall O
soil O
health O
of O
the O
system O
(Drinkwater O
1999 O
). O
In O
regions O
where O
grains O
can O
successfully O
overwinter, O
fall-planted O
grains O
can O
fit O
into O
production O
windows O
not O
available O
to O
other O
crops. O
Additionally, O
winter O
small O
grains O
can O
help O
suppress O
weeds O
in O
subsequent O
crops O
(Teasdale O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Anderson O
2010 O
; O
Ryan O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Baker O
and O
Mohler O
2014 O
). O
Disease O
and O
insect O
pests O
can O
be O
managed O
effectively O
by O
choosing O
resistant O
varieties O
and O
using O
cultural O
control O
methods O
(Wiersma O
et O

). O
Barley O
(Hordeum O
vulgare O
L.) O
offers O
many O
benefits O
for O
organic O
farming O
systems. O
In O
regions O
where O
it O
is O
suitable O
as O
a O
winter O
grain, O
barley O
establishes O
rapidly O
in O
the O
fall O
and O
can O
out-compete O
annual O
winter O
weeds. O
Because O
of O
its O
quick O
canopy O
growth O
after O
seeding, O
barley O
can O
be O
quite O
competitive O
against O
weeds. O
Many O
diseases O
and O
insects O
that O
affect O
barley O
are O
regionally O
specific, O
but O
this O
pressure O
can O
generally O
be O
managed O
effectively O
using O
integrated O
pest O
management O
strategies. O
However, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
most O
currently O
available O
varieties O
have O
been O
selected O
for O
conventional O
growing O
conditions O
and O
many O
may O
not O
always O
be O
the O
best O
suited O
for O
organic O
farming O
conditions; O
breeding O
new O
varieties O
under O
organic O
conditions O
can O
help O
remedy O
this. O
Barley O
offers O
some O
advantages O
over O
other O
small O
grains: O
it O
requires O
less O
nitrogen O
than O
wheat O
and O
matures O
more O
quickly O
than O
other O
small O
grains, O
which O
allows O
subsequent O
crops O
to O
be O
planted O
earlier O
(Wiersma O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Because O
it O
can O
be O
malted O
for O
brewing O
and O
distilling, O
eaten O
as O
a O
food O
grain, O
and O
fed O
to O
livestock, O
barley O
provides O
diverse O
marketing O
options. O

Introduction O
Streptococcus O
agalactiae O
is O
recognized O
by O
Lancefield O
classification O
as O
group O
B O
Streptococcus O
(GBS). O
This O
group O
includes O
nine O
historically O
known O
serotypes O
(Ia, O
Ib, O
II, O
III, O
IV, O
V, O
VI, O
VII, O
VIII) O
and O
a O
further O
(IX) O
of O
more O
recent O
identification O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
The O
discrimination O
of O
the O
different O
serotypes O
depends O
on O
type-specific O
capsular O
polysaccharides O
that O
constitute O
also O
a O
virulence O
factor, O
through O
which O
GBS O
eludes O
the O
host O
immune O
response O
[ O
3 O
, O
4 O
]. O
However, O
the O
expression O
of O
specific O
polysaccharides O
at O
the O
extracellular O
level O
is O
not O
the O
only O
invasion O
mechanism O
used O
by O
S. O
agalactiae. O
Indeed, O
analogously O
to O
other O
microorganisms O
[ O
5 O
], O
S. O
agalactiae O
is O
able O
to O
produce O
biofilm, O
a O
polysaccharide O
matrix O
that O
allows O
bacteria O
to O
hide O
from O
the O
immune O
system, O
favoring O
its O
persistence O
when O
environmental O
conditions O
are O
adverse O
[ O
6 O
]. O
Despite O
these O
pathogenic O
features, O
S. O
agalactiae O
is O
generally O
harmless O
for O
human O
health, O
being O
a O
commensal O
commonly O
present O
in O
the O
lower O
genital O
and O
gastroenteric O
tract O
of O
healthy O
women O
[ O
7 O
]. O
The O
screening O
for O
the O
identification O
of O
GBS O
becomes O
essential O
in O
pregnant O
women, O
due O
to O
a O
serious O
risk O
for O
newborn O
to O
contract O
the O
infection O
during O
birth. O
Data O
regarding O
the O
incidence O
of O
S. B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
infections O
in O
newborns O
are O
decidedly O
not O
encouraging. O
Accordingly, O
S. B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
is O
responsible O
for O
between O
114,000 O
and O
204,000 O
invasive O
cases O
and O
147,000 O
stillbirths O
and O
infant O
deaths O
every O
year O
worldwide. O
Furthermore, O
the O
neonatal O
mortality O
rates, O
ranging O
from O
10 O
to O
15% O
and O
40 O
to O
58% O
in O
developed O
and O
developing O
countries, O
respectively, O
clearly O
confirm O
that O
vertical O
transmission O
of O
S. B-PATH
agalactiae I-PATH
still O
represents O
an O
emergency O
worldwide O
[ O
8 O
– O
10 O
]. O
These O
numbers O
reflect O
a O
diffused O
and O
homogeneous O
vaginal O
and O
rectal O
GBS O
colonization O
among O
pregnant O
women O
worldwide, O
with O
some O
variations O
between O
the O
different O
regions O
of O
the O
world. O

In O

the O

a O

than O
those O
of O
our O
previously O

bacteriophages O
[ O

TEM O
and O
phylogenetic O
analysis O
indicated O
that O
phage O
φAbp2 O
should O
be O
assigned O
to O
the O
subfamily O
Peduovirinae O
based O
on O
its O
morphological O
characteristics O
and O
its O
phylogenetic O
relationship O
to O
phages O
of O
the O
family O
Myoviridae. O
Based O
on O
its O
morphology O
and O
genome O
features, O
phage O
φAbp2 O
was O
determined O
to O
be O
a O
new O
member O
of O
the O
subfamily O
Peduovirinae O
of O
the O
family O
Myoviridae, O
order O

revealed O
a O

and O
a O
burst O
size O
of O
222 O

which O
is O
smaller O

that O
of O

[ O

Compared O
with O
our O
previously O
isolated O
φAbp1, O
φAbp2 O
had O
a O
smaller O
burst O
size O
[ O
14 O
] O
but O
a O
wider O
range O
of O
pH O
and O
thermal O

[ O

] O
as O
well O
as O
a O
broader O
host O
range O
among O
local O
MDR O
A. O
baumannii O
strains, O
making O
φAbp2 O
a O
more O
suitable O
candidate O
than O
φAbp2 O
for O
clinical O
application. O
The O
high O
mutation O
rate O
of O
bacteriophages O
makes O
it O
difficult O
to O
identify O
gene O
functions O
[ O
18 O
], O
and O
this O
lack O
of O
information O
limits O
their O
application O
and O
causes O
uncertainty O
regarding O
their O
safety O
[ O
19 O
, O
20 O
]. O
There O
are O
many O
similarities O
between O
the O
genes O
of O
φAbp2 O
and O
those O
of O
previously O
identified O
bacteriophages. O

Multivariant O
analyses O
further O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
greatest O
risk O
factor O
for O
asthma O
was O
RSV O
bronchiolitis O
independent O
of O
a O
family O
history O
of O

Moreover, O
the O
Tucson O
Children's O
Respiratory O
Study O
demonstrated O
that O
even O
children O
with O
mild O
RSV O
infections O
were O
4 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
recurrent O
wheeze O
by O
6 O
years O
of O
age[ O
12 O
]. O
Cumulatively, O
the O
data O
suggest O
that O
RSV O
bronchiolitis O
in O
infancy O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
wheeze, O
which O
may O
persist O
for O
several O
years O
and O
is O
not O
adequately O
explained O
by O
a O
family O
history O
of O
atopy. O
Whether O
RSV O
directly O
contributes O
to O
the O
development O
of O
asthma O
remains O
unclear. O
A O
recent O
study O
using O
an O
animal O
model O
of O
RSV O
infection O
demonstrated O
that O
&quot;infections O
in O
early O
life O
play O
an O
important O
role&quot; O
in O
shaping O
the O
secondary O
immune O
response O
to O
antigen O
leading O
to O
long-term O
consequences O
for O
the O
host[ O
13 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
Culley O
and O
colleagues O
showed O
that O
the O
age O
of O
initial O
infection O
played O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
the O
secondary O
response O
of O
these O
same O
animals O
to O
rechallenge O
with O
RSV O
at O
12 O
weeks O
of O
age. O
Interestingly, O
if O
the O
mice O
were O
initially O
infected O
at O
1 O
– O
7 O
days O
of O
age, O
then O
their O
immune O
response O
to O
rechallenge O
at O
12 O
weeks O
of O
age O
was O
characterized O
by O
enhanced O
bronchoalveolar O
lavage O
(BAL) O
cellularity O
including O
increased O
eosinophil O
and O
neutrophil O
numbers, O
increased O
CD8+ O
T O
cell O
numbers, O
and O
increased O
CD4+ O
T O
cell O
production O
of O
intracellular O
IL-4. O
The O
data O
seemed O
to O
indicate O
that O
a O
CD4+ O
response O
was O
important O
in O
creating O
the O
immune O
memory O
response O
of O
the O
neonatal O
mice O
to O
RSV, O
while O
a O
CD8+ O
response O
seemed O
important O
in O
the O
older O
animals O
(age O
4 O
– O
8 O
wks). O
Furthermore, O
these O
data O
suggested O
that O
the O
Th2 O
skewing O
of O
the O
immune O
response O
was O
likely O
to O
be O
important O
in O
eliciting O
disease O
pathogenesis. O
Although O
this O
work O
was O
seminal O
in O
demonstrating O
the O
importance O
of O
timing O
(7 O
d O
vs. O

WEIRD O
samples O
themselves O
are O
certainly O
not O
homogeneous, O
and O
for O
instance O
even O
people O
from O
different O
neighbourhoods O
within O
the O
same O
city O
can O
vary O
as O
much O
as O
people O
from O
entirely O
different O
cultures O
(Nettle O
2017 O
; O
Nettle O
et O
al. O
2011 O
). O
Thus, O
even O
samples O
from O
WEIRD O
cultures O
can O
be O
sufficiently O
diverse O
that O
they O
provide O
some O
useful O
evidence O
in O
support O
of O
generalisability. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
evolutionary O
psychologists O
are O
often O
keen O
to O
sample O
outside O
WEIRD O
populations O
because O
of O
their O
interest O
in O
assessing O
and O
recording O
the O
nature O
of O
humans O
as O
a O
species. O
WEIRD O
populations O
may O
experience O
environments O
(in O
terms O
of O
novel O
technology, O
experience O
of O
hunger, O
exposure O
to O
death O
and O
so O
on) O
that O
are O
particularly O
dissimilar O
from O
those O
experienced O
by O
many O
of O
our O
ancestors, O
something O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
borne O
in O
mind O
when O
constructing O
and O
testing O
evolutionary O
theories O
of O
behaviour. O
Human O
universals O
(Brown O
1991 O
, O
2000 O
) O
may O
only O
be O
uncovered O
following O
assessment O
of O
multiple O
human O
populations, O
if O
not O
all O
populations, O
and O
assist O
in O
developing O
and O
evaluating O
evolutionary O
theories O
of O
behaviour. O
If O
we O
are O
to O
test O
how O
individual O
differences O
may O
be O
functionally O
adaptive O
(Tybur O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Wilson O
1998 O
), O
we O
need O
to O
compare O
individuals O
from O
different O
ecological O
settings O
(Nettle O
2009 O
). O
An O
awareness O
of O
the O
diversity O
of O
worldwide O
human O
behaviours O
would O
help O
us O
understand O
how O
human O
behaviours O
emerge O
from O
an O
interaction O
between O
local O
ecologies O
and O
our O
evolved O
brains O
(Henrich O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
For O
these O
sorts O
of O
reasons, O
classic O
studies O
that O
seek O
to O
test O
adaptive O
reasoning O
have O
taken O
pains O
to O
survey O
different O
populations O
(e.g. O
Buss O
1989 O
; O
Daly O
and O
Wilson O
1988 O
; O
Kenrick O
and O
Keefe O
1992 O
; O
Schaller O
and O
Murray O
2008 O
; O
Schmitt O
2005 O
; O
Scott O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
Reliance O
on O
WEIRD O
populations O
limits O
discovery O
of O
any O
patterns O
that O
might O
allow O
us O
to O
predict O
domains O
where O
psychological O
phenomena O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
universal, O
and O
domains O
where O
psychological O
phenomena O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
show O
variability O
(Henrich O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
As O
an O
additional O
step, O
WEIRD O
authors O
(including O
ourselves) O
could O
usefully O
reach O
out O
to O
non-WEIRD O
collaborators O
to O
attempt O
to O
draw O
from O
wider O
samples. O
Encouraging O
greater O
diversity O
among O
authors O
should O
automatically O
increase O
participant O
diversity O
(Medin O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
inevitable O
that O
natural O
selection O
would O
result O
in O
A. O
mellifera O
adapting O
to O
V. O
destructor O
if O
managed O
colonies O
were O
left O
untreated, O
this O
option O
was O
not O
considered O
in O
apiculture O
as O
the O
foreseen O
loss O
of O
colonies O
raised O
understandable O
concern O
over O
the O
sustainability O
of O
crop O
pollination O
and O
hence O
food O
security O
(Klein O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Aizen O
et O
al. O
2008 O
). O
Therefore, O
V. O
destructor O
has O
been O
permanently O
controlled O
in O
managed O
colonies, O
preventing O
coevolution O
processes O
(as O
predicted O
by O
Oldroyd O
1999 O
), O
leading O
to O
host O
resistance O
and O
tolerance O
or O
lowered O
virulence O
of O
the O
parasite, O
to O
take O
place O
(Neumann O
and O
Blacquière O
2017 O
; O
Brosi O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
There O
is O
clear O
evidence O
that O
wild O
populations O
of O
A. O
mellifera O
can O
survive O
V. O
destructor O
infestations O
by O
means O
of O
natural O
selection O
(Seeley O
2007 O
; O
Le O
Conte O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Fries O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
see O
Locke O
2016 O
for O
a O
review). O
This O
also O
holds O
true O
for O
managed O
populations, O
which O
have O
not O
been O
treated O
against O
V. O
destructor O
(Oddie O
et O
al. O
2017 O
, O
2018 O
; O
Kruitwagen O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
Panziera O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
McMullan O
2018 O
). O
Therefore, O
sustainable O
beekeeping O
without O
the O
need O
to O
treat O
V. O
destructor O
is O
clearly O
feasible. O
Even O
though O
the O
mechanisms O
underpinning O
resistance O
to O
V. O
destructor O
infestation O
without O
treatment O
are O
not O
yet O
fully O
understood, O
we O
propose O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
Darwinian O
natural O
selection O
for O
adaptation O
of O
bees O
to O
this O
novel O
parasite O
as O
an O
integrated O
part O
of O
local O

practice. O
We O
present O
an O
outline O
for O
a O
(natural) O
selection O
route O
that O
can O
be O
incorporated O
in O
any O
local O
beekeeping, O
which O
includes O
methods O
to O
limit O
collateral O
damage, O
such O
as O

Hence, O
assuming O
that O
CYP128A1 O
is O
indeed O
a O
quinol O
hydroxylase, O
it O
is O
an O
unlikely O
therapeutic O
target O
for O
Mtb. O
CYP130A1: O
an O
orphan O
enzyme O
Cyp130a1, O
as O
well O
as O
cyp141a1, O
are O
not O
required O
for O
Mtb O
growth O
in O

Furthermore, O
these O
genes O
are O
absent O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
species O
Mycobacterium O
bovis, O
suggesting O
that, O
if O
they O
play O
a O
role O
in O
virulence, O
this O
must O
be O
specific O
for O
Mtb. O
Cyp130a1 O
is O
located O
alongside O
the O
same O
functional O
operon O
as O
Rv1258c, O
a O
gene O
encoding O
a O
putative O
tetracycline/aminoglycoside O
resistance O
(TAP)2-like O
efflux O
pump, O
which O
is O
upregulated O
treatment O
with O
tetracycline, O
streptomycin, O
erythromycin, O
and O
rifampicin O
(unlike O
cyp130a1, O
as O
discussed O
in O
section O
5) O
and O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
efflux-mediated O
resistance O
in O
MDR-TB O
(Siddiqi O
et O
al. O
2004 O
; O
Morris O
et O

2005 O
; O
Jiang O
et O

2008 O
; O
Burian O
et O
al. O
2012 O
; O
Boot O
et O

2018 O
). O
Yet, O
no O
direct O
functional O
association O
has O
been O
reported O
between O
cyp130a1 O
and O
Rv1258c. O
Recently, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
CYP130A1 O
can O
catalyze O
the O
N-demethylation O
of O
dextromethorphan O
yielding O
3-methoxymorphinan O
(Fig. O
1 O
) O
(Ortega O
Ugalde O
et O
al. O
2018b O
). O
Although O
dextromethorphan O
cannot O
be O
considered O
a O
physiological O
substrate O
for O
this O
enzyme, O
it O
does O
provide O
a O
starting O
point O
for O
(1) O
the O
identification O
of O
bacterial O
reactions O
CYP130A1 O
may O
catalyze O
and O
(2) O
the O
identification O
of O
inhibitors. O
Nevertheless, O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
comprehensive O
data O
on O
the O
impact O
of O
CYP130A1 O
on O
Mtb O
virulence, O
its O
potential O
as O
a O
drug O
target O
remains O
to O
be O
determined. O

AD O
is O
the O
most O
prevalent O
neurodegenerative O
disorder O
and O
the O
leading O
cause O
of O
dementia O
worldwide, O
accounting O
for O
approximately O
60%–70% O
of O
all O
cases O
(Irizarry, O
2001 O
; O
Fratiglioni, O
2001 O
). O
AD O
is O
a O
highly O
incapacitating O
disorder, O
progressing O
from O
minor O
memory O
problems O
to O
a O
complete O
loss O
of O
mental O
functions O
and O
in O
the O
long O
run, O
resulting O
in O
death. O
The O
symptoms O
of O
AD O
are O
caused O
by O
a O
progressive O
loss O
of O
cholinergic O
function O
due O
to O
neuronal O
cell O
death O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
cerebral O
cortex O
and O
different O
regions O
of O
the O
brain O
which O
regulate O
thought O
process O
and O
memory. O
Furthermore, O
the O
neuropathological O
hallmarks O
of O
AD O
consist O
of O
two O
kinds O
of O
protein O
aggregates, O
amyloid O
beta O
(Aβ) O
plaques O
and O
hyper-phosphorylated O
tangles O
of O
tau-protein. O
Aβ O
is O
a O
transmembrane O
protein O
which O
has O
no O
known O
function, O
which O
is O
constitutively O
cleaved O
into O
peptides O
during O
the O
metabolic O
functions O
of O
the O
cell O
(Haass O
et O
al., O
1992 O
). O
However, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
overproduction O
(or O
impaired O
clearance), O
Aβ O
aggregates O
into O
extracellular O
oligomers, O
fibrils O
and O
eventually, O
plaques O
(Masters O
et O
al., O
1985 O
). O
Whereas, O
tau O
is O
an O
intracellular O
microtubule O
binding O
protein O
which, O
when O
hyper-phosphorylated, O
results O
in O
the O
disassembly O
of O
microtubules O
and O
thus O
leads O
to O
the O
impediment O
axonal O
transport O
and O
compromises O
neuronal O
and O
synaptic O
functions O
(Iqbal O
et O
al., O
2005 O
). O
There O
are O
now O
several O
studies O
linking O
obesity O
and O
other O
metabolic O
disorders O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
AD. O
In O
addition, O
the O
inflammation O
and O
the O
pathogens O
interaction O
hypothesis O
(i.e. O
microbial O
infections O
are O
causing O
the O
tau O
tangles O
and O
build-up O
of O
amyloid O
proteins, O
resulting O
in O
the O
ensuing O
cell O
death) O
were O
also O
risk O
factors O
of O
AD O
development. O
The O
‘gut O
microbiota’ O
can O
be O
defined O
as O
all O
the O
species O
within O
the O
ecosystem O
and O
are O
considered O
the O
largest O
reservoir O
of O
microbes O
in O
the O
human O
body, O
containing O
about O
10 O
14 O
microbes. O

Although O
there O
is O
a O
full O
recovery O
of O
PVMs O
to O
PBS-treated O
CTRL O
ASO O
levels O
in O
mice O
treated O
with O
PLG O
ASO O
prior O
to O
LPS O
injection, O
activation O
of O
microglia/macrophages O
and O
astrocytes O
is O
still O
increased O
compared O
to O
controls, O
indicating O
that O
PVMs O
are O
not O
fully O
responsible O
for O
the O
neuroimmune O
response O
to O
LPS. O
For O
example, O
LPS O
can O
act O
directly O
on O
endothelial O
cells O
to O
stimulate O
the O
release O
of O
cytokines O
and O
other O
inflammatory O
mediators O
such O
as O
cyclooxygenase-2 O
into O
the O
parenchyma O
of O
the O
brain O
[ O
10 O
]. O
However, O
while O
it O
has O
been O
known O
that O
LPS O
causes O
activation O
of O
microglial O
cells, O
the O
mechanism O
remains O
elusive. O
Our O
current O
study O
increases O
evidence O
that O
PVMs O
likely O
play O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
this O
response. O
A O
summary O
of O
our O
proposed O
mechanism O
is O
summarized O
in O

which O
(5) O

Notably, O

also O
suggest O
that O
plasma O

may O
be O
an O
effective O
treatment O
for O

However, O
PLG O

is O
known O
to O
cause O
other O
disorders, O
such O
as O
conjunctivitis O
of O
the O

on O
the O

all O
of O
which O
are O

in O

]. O
The O
predominance O
of O
women O
among O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
peritonitis O
patients O
might O
implicate O
ascending O
infections O
of O
the O

since O
S. O
pyogenes O
are O
often O
part O
of O
the O

flora O
[ O

]. O
According O
to O
a O
systematic O
review O
of O
primary O
peritonitis O
caused O
by O
streptococcus, O
16% O
of O
patients O
developed O
streptococcal O
toxic O
shock O
syndrome O
(STSS) O
from O
an O
ascending O
infection O
originating O
from O
the O
vagina, O
9% O
of O
patients O
developed O
it O
from O
a O
droplet O
infection, O
6% O
of O
patients O
developed O
it O
from O
pharyngitis, O
and O
69% O
of O
patients O
developed O
it O
via O
an O
unknown O
route O
[ O
9 O
]. O
In O
our O
case, O
we O
could O
not O
determine O
the O
primary O
site O
of O
infection; O
we O
should O
have O
collected O
a O
vaginal O
culture O
to O
confirm O
whether O
the O
infection O
originated O
in O
the O
vaginal O
tract. O
For O
the O
same O
reason, O
we O
should O
have O
collected O
a O
pharynx O
culture. O
The O
diagnosis O
of O
peritonitis O
was O
based O
on O
the O
presence O
of O
purulent O
ascites O
cultures O
with O
increased O
lactate O
dehydrogenase O
(LDH) O
and O
white O
blood O
cells O
(WBC) O
and O
CT O
findings O
of O
increased O

within O
the O

and O

Necrotizing O
fasciitis O
is O
an O
infection O
of O
the O
deeper O
subcutaneous O
tissue O
and O
fascia O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
rapidly O
spreading O
necrosis O
of O
the O
skin. O
The O
successful O
management O
of O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
is O
dependent O
on O
early O
recognition, O
but O
classical O
signs O
of O
a O
necrotizing O
process O
are O
not O
initially O
apparent. O

To O
date O
there O
have O
been O
no O
reports O
of O
functional O
studies O
involving O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
in O
non-Dikarya O
fungal O
groups. O
However, O
given O
the O
important O
roles O
of O
lipid O
droplets O
in O
the O
transport O
of O
carbon O
from O
host O
plants O
to O
mycorrhizal O
species O
[ O
110 O
], O
it O
would O
be O
useful O
to O
study O
possible O
roles O
for O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
in O
such O
fungi. O
Interestingly, O
in O
the O
only O
sequenced O
Glomeromycotina O
species, O
Rhizophagus O
irregularis, O
there O
are O
no O
fewer O
than O
three O
CLO/PXG–like O
genes O
(Additional O
file O
3 O
: O
Table O
S3). O
As O
noted O
above, O
entomopathogenic O
fungi O
use O
specialized O
structures, O
termed O
appressoria, O
to O
break O
through O
the O
cuticular O
surfaces O
of O
their O
hosts O
and O
similar O
structures O
are O
found O
in O
phytopathogenic O
fungi. O
It O
is O
known O
that O
lipid O
droplets O
are O
required O
for O
appressorium O
function O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
the O
high O
turgor O
pressure O
that O
is O
required O
for O
virulence O
[ O
8 O
, O
111 O
]. O
In O
both O
the O
rice O
blast O
fungus, O
Magnaporthe O
grisea O
[ O
111 O
], O
and O
the O
insect O
pathogen, O
Metarhizium O
anisopliae O
[ O
8 O
], O
lipid O
droplets O
originate O
in O
fungal O
spores O
and O
redistribute O
to O
the O
incipient O
appressorium. O
Lipid O
droplets O
also O
play O
roles O
in O
colonization O
and O
sexual O
development O
in O
other O
fungi O
including O
the O
wheat O
pathogen, O
Fusarium O
graminearum O
[ O
112 O
], O
and O
Aspergillus B-PATH
nidulans I-PATH
[ O
113 O
], O
which O
is O
both O
a O
soil-dwelling O
fungus O
and O
opportunistic O
human O
pathogen. O
Interestingly, O
in O
the O
widely O
studied O
Saccharomycetes O
class, O
only O
one O
out O
of O
the O
48 O
sequenced O
species O
contains O
CLO/PXG O
genes. O
Therefore, O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
are O
absent O
from O
such O
important O
experimental O
species O
as O
brewers’ O
yeast, O
Candida O
spp. O
and O
Pichia O
spp. O
but O
are O
present O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
yeast, O
Lipomyces O

Hence, O

in O

We O
also O
used O
the O
UniProt O

additional O

Ten O
common O
DEGs O
in O
this O
category O
were O
found O
in O
both O
SCZ O
and O
YH9 O
(Table O

); O
however, O
70 O
and O
56 O
DEGs O
were O
present O
only O
in O
SCZ O
and O
YH9, O
respectively, O
indicating O
different O
regulation O
in O
pathways O
in O
the O
two O
tea O
varieties. O
Many O
of O
the O
predicted O
functions O
of O
these O
DEGs O
are O
defense-related O
kinases, O
transcription O
factors, O
or O
heat O
shock O
proteins O
(Table O

). O
Multiple O
members O
of O
gene O
families O
BAK1, O
HSP, O
and O
PBS1 O
were O
expressed, O
but O
only O
a O
subset O
of O
members O
was O
differentially O
expressed O
(Table O
1 O
), O
indicating O
functional O
diversity O
of O
these O
families O
in O
cold O
response. O
Among O
these O
genes, O
FLS2 O
exhibited O
very O
different O
expression O
patterns O
between O
SCZ O
and O
YH9 O
(Fig. O

While O
plenty O
of O
data O
support O
this O
specificity O
pattern, O
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
it O
remain O
to O
be O
elucidated O
(Herbert O
and O
Goodrich-Blair O
2007 O
; O
Hillman O
and O
Goodrich-Blair O
2016 O
). O
Laboratory O
studies O
on O
the O
specificity O
of O
symbiotic O
associations O
are O
usually O
based O
on O
removal O
of O
native O
microsymbionts O
followed O
by O
re-association O
of O
nematode-bacterium O
pairs O
with O
non-native O
bacteria. O
Such O
experiments O
demonstrated O
strong O
partner O
preference, O
however O
with O
the O
potential O
for O
horizontal O
transfer O
of O
symbionts O
between O
different O
species O
of O
nematodes, O
depending O
on O
the O
bacterium-nematode O
pair O
used O
(e. O
g. O
Sicard O
et O
al. O
2004 O
; O
Sicard O
et O

2017b O
; O
Kazimierczak O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
Sajnaga O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
In O
fact, O
the O
bacterial O
host-switching O
between O
nematode O
species, O
even O
those O
representing O
different O
clades, O
seems O
to O
be O
rare O
but O
possible, O
especially O
that O
associations O
of O
nematodes O
with O
new O
symbiotic O
partners O
may O
enable O
colonization O
of O
new O
niches O
or O
extend O
one O
by O
conferring O
significant O
fitness O
benefits O
(Henry O
et O
al. O
2013 O
; O
Maher O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Nevertheless, O
the O
microsymbiont O
switching O
has O
most O
often O
a O
detrimental O
effect O
on O
the O
nematode O
host O
because O
association O
with O
non-cognate O
symbionts O
results O
in O
a O
decline O
in O
their O
reproduction O
fitness, O
symbiont O
carriage, O
and O
virulence. O
As O
expected, O
nematode-bacterium O
pairs O
with O
bacteria O
closely O
related O
to O
its O
native O
microsymbiont O
are O
more O
efficient O
in O
terms O
of O
reproductive O
fitness O
and O
virulence O
than O
those O
with O
a O
distantly O
related O
microsymbiont. O
The O
reproductive O
success O
of O
the O
nematode O
associated O
with O
non-cognate O
bacteria O
is O
also O
strongly O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
the O
phylogenetic O
distance O
between O
nematodes O
being O
a O
donor O
and O
a O
recipient O
of O
microsymbionts, O
confirming O
that O
the O
nematode O
host O
diversity O
strongly O
influences O
coadaptation O
between O
symbiotic O
partners O
(Murfin O
et O
al. O
2015b O
; O
McMullen O
et O
al. O
2017b O
). O

No O
significant O
differences O
were O
observed O
in O
the O
distribution O

bla O
CTX-M O
, O
bla O
SHV O
and O
bla O
TEM O
genes O
among O
isolates O
from O
the O
three O
groups, O
suggesting O
the O
wide O
dissemination O
of O
these O
genes O
possibly O
via O
horizontal O
transfer O
in O
different O
populations. O
Interestingly, O
the O
CTX-M-1 O
variant O
was O
more O
frequently O
detected O
among O
CA O
strains O
than O
among O
nosocomial O
strains, O
whereas O
the O
CTX-M-9 O
variant O
was O
more O
common O
in O
nosocomial O
strains O
than O
in O
CA O
strains. O
This O
suggests O
that O
nosocomial O
and O
CA O
ESBL-producing O
strains O
may O
carry O
different O
plasmids, O
which O
carried O
the O
different O
subtype O
of O
CTX-M O
genes. O
Overall, O
the O
PFGE O
typing O
showed O
a O
high O
clonal O
diversity O
among O
the O
ESBL-producing O
and O
CRKP O
strains O
isolated O
from O
the O
three O
different O
groups, O
indicating O
the O
variety O
of O
infection O
sources O
acquired O
by O
the O
three O
populations. O
Of O
note, O
the O
clonal O
dissemination O
of O
ESBL-producing O
strains O
has O
occurred O
in O
the O
hospital O
as O
indicated O
by O
the O
three O
identical O
profiles O
observed O
in O
cluster O
C13. O
Further O
study O
is O
needed O
to O
investigate O
the O
origin O
and O
the O
route O
of O
the O
transmission. O
In O
cluster O
C82-II O
and O
cluster O
C82-III, O
the O
HCA O
strains O
and O
nosocomial O
strains O
showed O
the O
same O
PFGE O
profiles, O
suggesting O
the O
cross O
transmission O
of O
CRKP O
among O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
patients. O
CRKP O
strains O
could O
be O
introduced O
into O
the O
hospital, O
then O
spread O
within O
the O
institution O
and O
might O
cause O
nosocomial O
infections O
during O
the O
entry O
of O
HCA O
patients O
with O
CRKP O
infections, O
of O
which O
we O
should O
keep O
alert. O
Identical O
profiles O
among O
HCA O
CRKP O
isolates O
implies O
the O
clonal O
spread O
of O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
among O
HCA O
patients. O
It O
suggests O
the O
healthcare-associated O
transmission O
of O
CRKP O
strains O
in O
the O
local O
area. O
In O
addition, O
the O
same O
PFGE O
profiles O
were O
observed O
in O
strains O
carrying O
different O
resistance O
gene O
profiles, O
suggesting O
later O
acquisition O
of O
the O
resistance O
genes O
via O
horizontal O
transfer O
under O
antibiotic O
selection O
pressure. O
The O
main O
finding O
in O
the O
present O
study O
was O
that O
the O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
of O
HCA O
isolates O
was O
similar O
in O
severity O
to O
nosocomial O
isolates. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
determined O
whether O
this O
shared O
set O
of O
metabolic O
pathways O
is O
the O
major O
characteristic O
of O
a O
healthy O

sequencing O
for O

[ O

]. O
This O
high-throughput O
approach O
can O
enable O
isolation O
and O
identification O
of O

for O
further O
manipulation O
and O
mechanistic O
studies. O
The O
most O
common O
method O
for O
taxonomic O
characterization O
of O
complex O
bacterial O
communities O
is O
based O
on O
selective O
amplification O
and O
sequencing O
of O
part O
of O
the O
gene O
encoding O
the O
16S O
rRNA, O
part O
of O
the O
small O
ribosomal O
subunit O
in O
prokaryotes. O
This O
is O
a O
ubiquitous O
1.5 O
kb O
gene, O
containing O
conserved O
sequences O
and O
hypervariable O
regions O
(nine O
regions: O
V1-V9), O
the O
latter O
being O
useful O
for O
bacterial O
taxonomic O
classification, O
as O
originally O
described O
by O
Woese O
and O
colleagues O
[ O
29 O
]. O
In O
the O
first O
step O
of O
this O
technique, O
a O
pair O
of O
universal O
primers O
targeting O
conserved O
sequences O
flanking O
a O
hypervariable O
region O
are O
used O
to O
generate O
an O
amplicon O
library, O
which O
is O
then O
sequenced. O
To O
account O
for O
sequencing O
errors, O
amplicons O
which O
share O
sequence O
similarity O
above O
a O
certain O
threshold O
are O
grouped O
into O
operational O
taxonomic O
units O
(OTUs). O
A O
representative O
amplicon O
is O
selected O
from O
each O
OTU O
bin O
and O
assigned O
a O
taxonomic O
identity O
based O
on O
cross-referencing O
to O
pre-existing O
databases O
[ O
30 O
– O
32 O
]. O
All O
other O
amplicons O
in O
the O
OTU O
are O
also O
assigned O
the O
same O
identity. O

While, O
the O
role O
of O
AMT2-type O
transporters O
in O
wheat-rust O
interaction O
is O
not O
clear. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
the O
increased O
expression O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O
during O
Pst O
infection O
was O
expected O
to O
accelerate O
the O
ammonium O
translocation O
from O
intercellular O
space O
to O
mesophyll O
cells. O
However, O
the O
result O
showed O
that O
ammonium O
concentrations O
in O
the O
aerial O
part O
of O
wheat O
after O
Pst O
infection O
declined, O
which O
may O
be O
attributed O
to O
immediate O
assimilation O
of O
excess O
ammonium O
into O
amino O
acids O
[ O
26 O
]. O
Transcriptional O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
the O
single O
gene O
encoding O
AMT O
in O
Pst O
was O
downregulated O
during O
wheat O
infection, O
while O
the O
genes O
encoding O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
were O
upregulated, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
main O
form O
of O
nitrogen O
uptake O
by O
Pst O
from O
the O
host O
is O
amino O
acids O
rather O
than O
ammonium O
[ O
32 O
]. O
Thus, O
TaAMT2;3a O
may O
be O
exploited O
by O
the O
rust O
fungi O
to O
meet O
their O
demand O
for O
nitrogen. O
This O
hypothesis O
was O
further O
supported O
by O
the O
retarded O
fugal O
growth O
and O
increased O
level O
of O
ammonium O
contents O
in O
leaves O
at O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
Pst O
infection O
in O
TaAMT2;3a-knockdown O
plants. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
report O
on O
the O
function O
analysis O
of O
AMT2-type O
AMTs O
during O
interactions O
between O
plants O
and O
pathogens. O
Our O
results, O
together O
with O
the O
previous O
studies O
[ O
12 O
], O
suggest O
that O
the O
coordination O
between O
ammonium O
uptake O
and O
translocation O
mediated O
by O
AMT1 O
and O
AMT2-type O
AMTs O
helps O
rust O
pathogens O
uptake O
and O
assimilate O
nitrogen O
nutrients O
from O
the O
host. O
However, O
how O
and O
through O
what O
mechanism O
host O
ammonium O
or O
nitrogen O
is O
translocated O
to O
the O
fungus O
is O
still O
unclear. O
Analysis O
of O
other O
ammonium O
transporters O
and O
a O
more O
detailed O
determination O
of O
ammonium O
dynamics O
in O
hosts O
and O
pathogens O
are O
necessary O
for O
a O
full O
understanding O
of O
the O
biological O
roles O
of O
plant O
AMTs O
in O
plant-pathogen O
interactions. O
Conclusions O
The O
results O
obtained O
by O
this O
study O
indicate O
that O
during O
the O
wheat-Pst O
interaction, O
the O
wheat O
AMT2-type O
gene O
TaAMT2;3a O
was O
induced O
by O
rust O
infection O
and O
may O
facilitate O
the O
nitrogen O
uptake O
by O
rust O
fungus. O

We O
tried O
to O
screen O
out O
the O
same O
spontaneous O
rpoB O
mutation O
by O
rifampin O
pressure O
in O
the O
laboratory O
to O
prove O
our O
conjecture O
that O
the O
use O
of O
rifampin O
enriched O
the O
resistant O
strains. O
The O
results, O
however, O
are O
not O
satisfactory. O
The O
differences O
in O
mutation O
types O
between O
isolates O
and O
spontaneous O
mutant O
are O
worth O
considering. O
Almost O
50% O
of O
the O
rpoB O
mutations O
were O
strain-dependent, O
and O
the O
interaction O
of O
different O
types O
of O
rpoB O
mutations O
with O
other O
genomes O
would O
affect O
transcriptional O
levels, O
resulting O
in O
varying O
levels O
of O
fitness O
costs, O
and O
thus O
affecting O
the O
viability O
of O
mutant O
strains O
[ O
26 O
]. O
The O
resistance O
levels O
of O
most O
of O
the O
isolates O
were O
relatively O
low, O
but O
the O
overexpression O
strain O
ATCC O
11845-pLMF03::rpoB O
+ O
constructed O
according O
to O
the O
type O
of O
isolates O
all O
reached O
128 O
μg/mL, O
indicating O
that O
the O
level O
of O
drug O
resistance O
conferred O
by O
the O
rpoB O
mutation O
might O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
strain O
background. O
Second, O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
biological O
evolution, O
the O
replacement O
of O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
in O
a O
strain O
was O
not O
only O
a O
mutation O
of O
one O
amino O
acid O
site. O
The O
amino O
acid O
H531 O
of O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
in O
Pseudomonas O
aeruginosa O
could O
generate O
both O
H531R O
and O
H531Y O
mutations; O
continuous O
screening O
from O
two O
mutations O
was O
able O
to O
get O
the O
same O
site O
of O
the O
new O
mutation O
type O
H531C, O
while O
H531C O
weakened O
part O
of O
the O
H531R O
and O
H531Y O
fitness O
cost O
[ O
27 O
]. O
And O
that O
indicated O
that O
mutation O
from O
the O
wild O
type O
to O
H531C O
required O
a O
step-by-step O
process. O
In O
addition, O
as O
environmental O
conditions O
could O
affect O
protein O
stability O
and O
activity, O
rpoB O
mutations O
might O
affect O
the O
function O
of O
RNAP O
at O
different O
temperatures O
[ O
27 O
, O
28 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
selected O
rpoB O
mutations O
were O
specific O
under O
certain O
environmental O
pressures O
[ O
29 O
, O
30 O
], O
which O
also O
provided O
an O
explanation O
for O
the O
differences O
in O
detected O
rpoB O
mutations. O
Above O
all, O
the O
spontaneous O
mutation O
test O
in O
this O
study O
was O
carried O
out O
on O
solid O
medium O
without O
antibiotics O
at O
37 O
°C O
lacking O
clinically O
specific O
environmental O
pressures, O
making O
all O
mutations O
possible O
to O
survive, O
which O
had O
little O
to O
do O
with O
their O
respective O
fitness. O

Most O
HCV O
infections O
in O
the O
Amazon O
region O
consist O
of O
genotype O
1, O
whereas O
genotype O
3 O
is O
found O
mostly O
among O
PWUIDs O
[ O
16 O
, O
17 O
, O
24 O
, O
32 O
, O
35 O
– O
37 O
]. O
The O
rapid O
spread O
of O
genotypes O
1 O
and O
3 O
(and O
specifically O
subtypes O
1a O
and O
3a), O
in O
different O
geographic O
areas O
over O
the O
past O
decades, O
has O
been O
a O
consequence O
of O
efficient O
transmission O
through O
unsafe O
blood O
transfusion O
products O
and O
injecting O
drug O
use O
[ O
38 O
– O
40 O
]. O
This O
study O
is O
a O
first O
in O
describing O
HCV O
infection O
status O
(i.e. O
active O
and O
non-active) O
in O
a O
multi-site O
PWUIDs O
population O
in O
the O
Amazon O
region O
in O
Northern O
Brazil. O
Among O
577 O
PWUIDs O
infected O
with O
HCV, O
193 O
(33.4%) O
presented O
with O
HCV O
spontaneous O
clearance. O
The O
multivariate O
analysis O
suggested O
spontaneous O
clearance O
status O
to O
be O
strongly O
associated O
with O
origin O
(Amazonian-born) O
and O
non-white O
(e.g., O
Black O
or O
Indigenous) O
of O
the O
participants. O
The O
contemporary O
population O
of O
Northern O
Brazil O
is O
comprised O
of O
a O
heterogeneous O
socio-ethnic O
mixture O
of O
indigenous O
Brazilian O
natives O
combined O
with O
migratory O
populations O
of O
Caucasians O
and O
Blacks O
of O
diverse O
origins O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Likely, O
a O
predominance O
of O
indigenous O
descent, O
and O
associated O
genetic O
factors, O
is O
a O
variable O
behind O
this O
strong O
association O
of O
socio-ethnic O
origin O
with O
HCV O
spontaneous O
clearance. O
Genetic O
ancestry O
analysis O
markers O
were O
not O
used O
in O
this O
study, O
but O
related O
finding O
have O
also O
been O
detected O
in O
other O
studies, O
including O
native/indigenous O
people O
in O
North O
America O
[ O
5 O
, O
42 O
]. O
In O
Canada, O
a O
study O
conducted O
with O
PWUIDs O
found O
that O
Indigenous/Aboriginal O
status O
was O
a O
factor O
associated O
with O
HCV O
spontaneous O
clearance O
[ O
42 O
]. O
The O
understanding O
of O
factors O
that O
promote O
or O
prevent O
the O
generation O
of O
protective O
immunity O
is O
potentially O
crucial O
for O
the O
development O
especially O
of O
improved O
prevention O
(e.g., O
a O
possible O
HCV O
vaccine) O
and/or O
treatment O
tools O
for O
HCV O
infection; O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
from O
a O
clinical O
and O
virological O
perspective O
on O
these O
issues. O
HCV O
infection O
status O
was O
associated O
with O
several O
risk O
factors O
in O
this O
study, O
most O
of O
which O
have O
previously O
been O
identified O
by O
other O
studies O
in O
Brazil O
[ O
17 O
, O
19 O
– O
21 O
, O

, O

]. O

In O
addition, O
we O
test O
whether O
the O
sample O
sizes O
vary O
based O
on O
these O
categories. O
Our O
aim O
is O
to O
provide O
an O
up-to-date O
snapshot O
of O
contemporary O

sampling O

while O
responding O
to O
calls O
to O
increase O

(Scott-Phillips O

it O
is O
easier O

As O

of O
the O

Of O

or O
‘Psychological O

However, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
assume O
that O
any O

If O
a O

we O

an O
explicitly O

goal O
even O
with O

However, O
our O

that O
the O

Introduction O
Periodontitis O
is O
an O
inflammatory O
chronic O
disease O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
destruction O
of O
connective O
tissue O
and O
supporting O
bone O
1 O
, O
2 O
. O
It O
is O
a O
major O
oral O
disease O
that O
threatens O
oral O
health, O
and O
its O
prevalence O
is O
increasing O
mainly O
because O
the O
society O
is O
aging O
3 O
, O
4 O
. O
Physical O
activity O
provides O
many O
health O
benefits O
and O
improves O
the O
health-related O
quality O
of O
life O
5 O
– O
7 O
. O
Studies O
have O
shown O
that O
regular O
physical O
activity O
reduces O
the O
risk O
and O
mortality O
risk O
of O
many O
systemic O
diseases O
including O
cardiovascular O
disease, O
coronary O
heart O
disease, O
colon O
cancer, O
diabetes, O
osteoporosis, O
obesity, O
arthritis, O
and O
hypertension O
8 O
– O
11 O
. O
Recently, O
Kortas O
et O
al. O
12 O
reported O
that O
walking O
may O
decrease O
oxidative O
stress. O
Hypertension, O
obesity, O
and O
diabetes O
mellitus O
are O
interlinked O
in O
regard O
to O
oxidative O
stress O
and O
inflammation O
13 O
, O
14 O
. O
Meta-analyses O
have O
reported O
that O
walking O
improves O
the O
glycaemic O
control O
as O
assessed O
by O
glycated O
haemoglobin O
(HbA1c) O
in O
patients O
with O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
and O
that O
aerobic O
physical O
activity O
decreases O
the O
blood O
pressure O
of O
subjects O
with O
hypertension O
15 O
, O
16 O
. O
Oxidative O
stress O
can O
have O
critical O
effects O
on O
several O
diseases O
including O
periodontitis O
17 O
. O
Many O
studies O
show O
that O
regular O
walking O
reduces O
inflammation O
in O
the O
body O
18 O
– O
20 O
. O
Therefore, O
studying O
the O
association O
between O
regular O
walking O
and O
periodontitis O
can O
be O
valuable. O
Some O
cross-sectional O
epidemiologic O
studies O
confirm O
the O
link O
between O
physical O
activity O
and O
periodontitis O
21 O
, O
22 O
. O
However, O
there O
are O
no O
systematic O
large-scale O
epidemiological O
studies O
that O
have O
confirmed O
the O
effect O
of O
walking O
on O
periodontal O
disease. O
In O
addition, O
there O
is O
a O
report O
showing O
that O
the O
association O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
other O
inflammation-related O
diseases O
differs O
according O
to O
the O
socioeconomic O
status O
of O
the O
patient O
23 O
. O
Therefore, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
study O
socioeconomic O
status O
as O
an O
effect O
modifier O
when O
studying O
the O
association O
between O
periodontitis O
and O
physical O
activity. O
The O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
examine O
the O
relationship O
between O
regular O
walking O
and O
the O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
exploring O
the O
possible O
mechanisms O
of O
microbiota-mediated O
modulation O
of O
anti-tumor O
immunity, O
two O
general O
questions O
arise. O
First, O
what O
is O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
messenger, O
which O
delivers O
a O
signal O
from O
the O
GI O
tract O
to O
the O
tumor O
and/or O
tumor-draining O
lymph O
node O
(TdLN)? O
Such O
a O
messenger O
would O
be O
able O
to O
enter O
the O
circulation O
in O
order O
to O
access O
the O
distant O
tumor O
site O
and O
can O
be O
classified O
as O
microbiota- O
or O
host-derived O
cell O
(live O
microbes O
or O
host O
immune O
cells) O
or O
molecule O
(MAMP/PAMP, O
microbial O
metabolite, O
or O
host O
cytokine). O
The O
second O
question O
is O
what O
is O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
immune O
effect O
that O
the O
messenger O
confers O
within O
the O
tumor? O
An O
immunosuppressive O
effect O
could O
be O
achieved O
by O
augmenting O
regulatory O
functions O
(Tregs, O
MDSCs, O
tumor-associated O
macrophages) O
or O
directly O
inhibiting O
anti-tumor O
immunity; O
an O
immunostimulatory O
effect O
could O
be O
achieved O
by O
alleviating O
regulatory O
functions O
or O
stimulating O
anti-tumor O
T O
cell O
responses O
(via O
antigenicity, O
adjuvanticity O
or O
bystander O
activation). O
The O
exact O
mechanisms O
of O
microbiota-mediated O
effects O
on O
tumor O
growth O
and O
efficacy O
of O
immunotherapy O
are O
only O
beginning O
to O
be O
understood. O

numbers O
of O
sequences, O
with O
the O
proviso O
that O

curation O
is O
still O
required O
for O
more O
accurate O
results. O
One O
example O
of O
a O
useful O
prediction O
from O
MEME O
was O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O
sixth O
motif, O
labelled O

in O
Fig. O

and O
Additional O

Figure O
SI, O
that O
was O
located O
close O
to O
the O
N-terminus O
of O
the O
proteins. O
This O
motif O
(shaded O
green O
in O
the O
gene O
name O
column O
in O
the O
above O
Figures) O
was O
present O
in O
258 O
of O
the O
344 O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
sequences. O
Interestingly, O
fungal O
motif O
six O
was O
structurally O
similar O
to O
the O
N-terminal O
located O
motif O
4 O
that O
we O
previously O
found O
in O
Viridiplantae O
sequences O
[ O
4 O
]. O
This O
motif O
is O
also O
referred O
to O
in O
the O
literature O
as O
the O
‘H-domain’, O
which O
in O
plants O
is O
a O
30–50-residue O
sequence O
that O
is O
found O
in O
most O
CLO/PXG O
isoforms O
in O
some O
algae O
and O
more O
primitive O
land O
plants O
[ O
27 O
, O
29 O
, O
77 O
, O
78 O
]. O
In O
contrast, O
we O
found O
that O
in O
the O
much O
more O
recently O
evolved O
angiosperm O
phylum O
(also O
known O
as O
Angiospermae O
or O
Magnoliophya), O
which O
includes O
all O
flowering O
plants, O
every O
genome O
contained O
at O
least O
one O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
copy O
with O
an O
H-domain O
plus O
one O
copy O
where O
the O
H-domain O
was O
missing O
– O
the O
latter O
are O
termed O
L-domain O
isoforms O
because O
the O
proteins O
are O
3–5 O
kDa O
lighter O
than O
the O
corresponding O
H-domain O
isoforms O
[ O
4 O
]. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
angiosperms, O
the O
fact O
that O
each O
genome O
contains O
at O
least O
one O
copy O
of O
each O
isoform O
indicates O
that O
they O
probably O
have O
separate O
functions O
and O
it O
has O
been O
proposed O
that O
they O
may O
be O
located O
in O
different O
subcellular O
compartments O
[ O
4 O
]. O
In O
the O
Fungi, O
86 O
of O
344 O
the O
sequenced O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
encode O
proteins O
that O
lack O
motif O
6 O
and O
are O
therefore O
analogous O
to O
the O
plant O
L-domain O
isoforms O
while O
the O
remaining O
258 O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
encode O
proteins O
analogous O
to O
plant O
H-domain O
isoforms. O

These O
data O
suggest O
that O
pulmonary O
remodeling O
events O
are O
occurring O
in O
weanling O
mice O
exposed O
to O
allergen O
followed O
by O
RSV O
infections O
and, O
furthermore, O
that O
these O
exposures O
synergistically O
enhance O
pulmonary O
pathology O
and O
physiology. O
In O
fact, O
preliminary O
data O
suggest O
that O
AHR O
is O
prolonged O
only O
in O
the O
OOR O
group O
(&gt; O
4 O
weeks O
post O

whereas O
AHR O
in O
the O
OVA O
and O
ROO O

was O
no O
longer O
significantly O
different O
from O
SAL O
controls O
forty-eight O
hours O
after O
the O
last O
allergen O

Rarely, O
in O
humans O
or O
mice, O
is O
eosinophilia O
associated O
with O
primary O
RSV O
infection. O
However, O
RSV O
infection O
in O
combination O
with O
Ova O

resulted O
in O
significant O
pulmonary O

in O
both O

These O

seem O
inconsistent O
with O
those O
of O
Peebles O

who O
reported O

Although O
the O

cause O
for O
this O
discrepancy O
is O
unknown, O
there O
are O
several O
methodological O
differences O
between O
our O
studies, O
which O
may O
be O
pertinent. O
Peebles O
and O
colleagues: O
1) O
used O
adult O

in O
their O
studies, O
2) O
exposed O
their O
mice O
to O
daily O
Ova O

challenges O
for O
eight O
days, O
and O
3) O
infected O
their O
mice O
14 O

post O
Ova O

Whereas O
we: O
1) O
used O
weanling O
mice, O
2) O
exposed O
mice O
to O
aerosolized O
Ova O
for O
20 O
min O
for O
three O
consecutive O

3) O

to O
Ova O

immediately O

the O
last O
Ova O

(OOR). O
Although O
the O
enhanced O

of O
any O

did O
not O
correlate O

the O
ratio O

In O
plants, O
two O
different O
pathways O
such O

and O

pathway O
have O
been O
described O
for O
biosynthesis O
of O
vitB6 O

6 O
. O
First, O
the O
deoxy-xylulose O

(DXP) O
independent O
pathway O
was O
used O
for O
de O

biosynthesis O
of O
vitB6 O

. O
It O
involves O
the O
concerted O

of O
the O
pyridoxine O

proteins O
(PDX) O
such O
as O
pyridoxine O
biosynthesis O
protein1 O
(PDX1) O
and O

(PDX2), O
that O

to O
synthesize O
pyridoxal-5′-phosphate O
(PLP) O
as O
an O
active O
cofactor O

. O
Second, O
the O
salvage O
pathway O

is O

for O
the O
conversion O
of O

through O

It O

the O
concerted O
activities O
of O
a O

through O

while O
biosynthesis O

the O
activity O
of O
a O

. O
Recently, O
a O
pyridoxal O

characterized O
in O
Arabidopsis O

which O
is O
essential O
for O
conversion O
of O
PL O
into O
PN O

Studies O
showed O
that O
abiotic O

of O
pyridoxal O

and O
pyridoxal O
reductase O
enzymes O
which O
play O
a O
significant O
role O
mediated O
by O
salvage O
pathway O
8 O
– O
11 O
. O
Previous O
studies O
also O
showed O
that O

regulates O
up-regulation O
of O

Overall, O
increased O
downstream O

We O
additionally O
identified O
the O

that O

Unlike O
bulk O
analysis, O
using O
Met-Flow O
identifies O
specific O
metabolic O

These O
studies O
corroborate O
changes O

by O
Met-Flow O
and O
further O
emphasize O
unique O

Metabolism O

We O
previously O
demonstrated O
that O
GM-CSF O
increased O
with O
glycolytic O
inhibition O
in O
bulk O
T O
cells, O
unlike O
other O
effector O
cytokines. O
To O
determine O
whether O
the O
metabolically O
distinct O
T O
CM O
population O
was O
responsible O
for O
this O
inflammatory O
cytokine O
production, O
we O
measured O
GM-CSF O
production O
by O
incorporating O
a O
capture O
antibody O
into O
the O
Met-Flow O
capability. O
GM-CSF O
production O
by O
activated O
T O

stimulates O
myeloid O
cells O
to O
promote O
tissue O

. O
Our O
data O
confirmed O
increased O
GM-CSF O
with O
CD3/28 O
stimulation, O
linked O
to O
a O
higher O
metabolic O
state O
(Fig. O

whereas O
unstimulated O
or O
2-FDG-treated O

and O
showed O
lower O
levels O
of O
metabolic O
protein O
expression O
(Fig. O

). O
Across O
T-cell O

the O
T O

subset O
was O
the O
largest O
GM-CSF-producing O
population O
with O
CD3/28 O
activation O
(Fig. O

Addition O
of O

showed O
a O
selective O
reduction O
of O
GM-CSF O
production O
in O
T O
EM O
and O
T O
TEMRA O
memory O
populations. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
T O
CM O
subset O
increased O
with O
2-FDG O
addition O
to O
CD3/28, O
and O
the O
naive O
population O
showed O
a O
similar O
trend. O
This O
increase O
in O
the O
GM-CSF O
producing O
T O
CM O

was O
similar O
to O
the O
expanded O
pS6 O
high O
T O
CM O
population O
(Fig. O

demonstrating O
glycolytic O

Introduction O
Amphibian O
species O
are O
ectothermic, O
tetrapod, O
and O
mainly O
carnivorous O
vertebrate O
species O
of O
the O
class O
Amphibia O
(Hill O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
Modern O
amphibians O
inhabit O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
habitats, O
with O
most O
species O
living O
within O
terrestrial, O
fossorial, O
arboreal, O
or O
freshwater O
aquatic O
ecosystems. O
In O
the O
last O
decades, O
amphibians O
established O
themselves O
as O
domestic O
exotic O
pets/zoo O
animals O
worldwide O
(Mutschmann O
2010 O
). O
Amphibian O
species O
have O
suffered O
a O
significant O
decline O
in O
the O
wild O
during O
the O
last O
decades, O
mainly O
due O
to O
anthropogenic O
pressure, O
such O
as O
environmental O
contamination, O
UV-B O
irradiation, O
introduction O
of O
alien/invasive O
species, O
direct O
mistreatment, O
habitat O
losses, O
climate O
changes, O
and O
emerging O
diseases O
(e.g., O
chytridiomycosis, O
Ranavirus) O
(Daszak O

) O
and O
have O
attracted O
special O
media O
and O
public O
attention. O
This O
public O
attention O
among O
other O
factors O
has O
raised O
interest O
for O
these O
ectothermic O
animals O
resulting O
in O
an O
increased O
popularity O
of O
amphibians O
as O
private O
pets, O
also O
in O
Germany O
(Krautwald-Junghanns O
2017 O
). O
International O
amphibian O
trade O
is O
becoming O
governmentally O
more O
and O
more O
restricted O
in O
many O
countries. O
Radical O
restrictions O
seem O
to O
be O
impossible O
to O
implement O
and O
also O
require O
time, O
effort, O
and O
knowledge O
with O
no O
guarantee O
of O
success. O
Even O
non-regulated O
trade/black O
market O
activities O
happen O
as O
suggested O
elsewhere O
(Garner O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Bishop O
et O

). O
More O

and O
caudate O
(i.e., O

This O
highlights O
the O
need O
for O
large O
sample O
sizes. O
There O
are O
only O
two O
previous O
groEL O
sequences O
reported O
from O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
isolated O
from O
moose O
tissue. O
One O
sequence O
derived O
from O
a O
mainland O
moose O
in O
Sweden O
was O
an O
exact O
match O
of O
the O
sequence O
(GQ988754) O
from O
roe O
deer O
in O
Austria O
[ O
39 O
] O
clustering O
to O
ecotype O
II, O
while O
the O
sequence O
derived O
from O
a O
moose O
from O
the O
Island O
of O
Öland, O
Sweden O
clustered O
to O
ecotype O
I O
[ O

]. O
There O
are O
no O
red O
deer O
on O
Öland, O
but O
still O
ecotype O

was O
found O
there. O
Together O
with O
our O
discovery O
of O
frequent O
infection O
of O
ecotype O
I O
in O
moose, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
questing O
ticks O
in O
an O
area O
without O
red O
deer, O
this O
is O
indeed O
indicative O
of O
moose O
as O
a O
potential O
transmission O
host O
of O
ecotype O
I. O
Conclusion O
Our O
study O
provides O
one O
crucial O
step O
forward O
towards O
identifying O
assumed O
transmission O
hosts O
at O
the O
northern O
distribution O
ranges, O
and O
we O
have O
provided O
the O
first O
results O
potentially O
linking O
moose O
to O
both O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum. O
The O
importance O
of O
a O
given O
host O
for O
the O
disease O
hazard O
also O
depends O
on O
their O
abundance O
and O
the O
number O
of O
ticks O
feeding O
on O
them O
[ O
40 O
, O
41 O
]. O
Red O
deer O
can O
generally O
reach O
higher O
population O
densities O
than O
moose, O
while O
roe O
deer O
have O
highly O
variable O
densities O
that O
can O
be O
very O
high O
locally O
[ O
42 O
]. O
We O
found O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O

attached O
to O
red O

close O
to O
the O

Background O
The O
cultivated O
lentil O
(Lens O
culinaris O
Medikus O
ssp. O
culinaris) O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
agronomically O
important O
grain O
legumes O
with O
a O
global O
production O
of O
6.3 O
million O
tons O
in O
2016 O
which O
was O
primarily O
contributed O
by O
Canada O
(50.8%), O
India O
(16.8%), O
Turkey O
(5.8%) O
and O
the O
USA O
(4.0%) O
[ O
1 O
]. O
Abiotic O
and O
biotic O
stresses O
are O
reducing O
the O
yield O
potential O
of O
lentil, O
so O
breeding O
efforts O
have O
focused O
on O
the O
development O
of O
varieties O
with O
resistance O
to O
these O
stresses. O
The O
main O
breeding O
strategy O
has O
been O
relying O
on O
selection O
of O
superior O
individuals O
derived O
from O
crosses O
between O
elite O
breeding O
lines O
or O
cultivars. O
Due O
to O
the O
intensive O
selection O
driven O
by O
certain O
traits O
of O
interests O
and O
hybridization O
of O
closely O
related O
breeding O
lines, O
the O
genetic O
variability O
of O
lentil O
germplasm O
inevitably O
has O
been O
narrow O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Associated O
with O
limited O
genetic O
variability O
in O
crops O
is O
a O
heightened O
risk O
for O
crop O
vulnerability O
to O
biotic O
and O
abiotic O
stresses, O
a O
major O
concern O
shared O
among O
plant O
breeders O
and O
growers O
alike O
[ O

Stemphylium O
blight O
(SB), O
caused O
by O
the O
necrotrophic O
ascomycete O
Stemphylium O
botryosum O
Wallr., O
is O
a O
devastating O
disease O
of O
lentil O
in O
several O
lentil-producing O
countries, O
including O
Canada, O
India, O
the O
USA, O
and O
Australia O
which O
together O
account O
for O
over O
70% O
of O
global O
production O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
This O
pathogen O
infects O
plants O
by O
airborne O
conidia O
that O
develop O
successive O
cycles O
of O
conidia O
on O
plants. O
In O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
SB, O
disease O
symptoms O
manifest O
as O
tan O
to O
light O
brown O
spots O
on O
lentil O
leaves. O
As O
the O
infection O
progresses, O
those O
initial O
spots O
expand O
to O
the O
entire O
leaves, O
resulting O
in O
the O
complete O
drying O
of O
leaves O
followed O
by O
defoliation. O
In O
the O
final O
stages, O
SB O
symptoms O
are O
also O
found O
on O
stems O
and O
hamper O
nutrient O
and O
water O
transport, O
which O
eventually O
kills O
the O
host. O
The O
economic O
losses O
caused O
by O
this O
pathogen O
can O
be O
up O
to O
80% O
[ O

]. O

Another O
advantage O
of O
shotgun O
sequencing O
is O
that O
it O
can O
be O
used O
for O
characterization O
of O
the O
functional O
capacity O
encoded O
by O
the O
microbiome O
using O
gene O
prediction O
tools O
and O
databases O
[ O

By O
contrast, O
functional O
capacity O
can O
only O
be O
inferred O
indirectly O
from O
16S O
rRNA O
amplicon O
sequencing O
data O
[ O
41 O
– O

Each O
of O
these O

methods O
has O
its O
limitations, O
but O
the O
two O
can O
be O
integrated O
to O

Impact O
of O

The O
role O
of O
the O
commensal O
microbiota O
in O
modulating O
host O
physiology O
becomes O
particularly O
evident O
when O
conventionally O
raised O
specific O
pathogen-free O
(SPF) O
mice O
are O
compared O
to O
germ-free O
(GF, O
axenic) O
mice. O
GF O
mice O
are O
defined O
as O
devoid O
of O
detectable O
microbiota O
during O
their O
life. O
The O
term O
gnotobiotic O
pertains O
to O
animals O
with O
known O
(defined) O
microbiota O
composition O
and O
encompasses O
GF, O
as O
well O
as O
ex-GF O
animals O
colonized O
with O
defined O
microbial O
communities. O
The O
commensal O
microbiota O
broadly O
impacts O
host O
physiology, O
and O
this O
has O
been O
mainly O
shown O
in O
studies O
with O

mice, O
which O
have O

Impact O
on O
local O
immunity O
The O
gut O
microbiota O
is O
intimately O
involved O
in O
the O
development O
and O
regulation O
of O
the O
immune O
system, O
especially O
with O
respect O
to O
local O
mucosal O
immunity. O
This O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
GF O
mice, O
which O
show O
deficiencies O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
immune O
compartment O
rendering O
them O
more O
susceptible O
to O
infections. O
However, O
such O
deficiencies O
can O
be O
corrected O
by O
colonization O
with O
commensal O
bacteria. O
For O
instance, O
in O
GF O
mice, O
the O
mucus-producing O
goblet O
cells O
are O
fewer O
and O
smaller. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
mucus O
layer, O
the O
first O
line O

Using O
a O
single-gene O
approach, O
Maneesakorn O
et O

( O

) O
provided O
evidence O
for O
a O
co-evolutionary O
pattern O
of O
relationships O
between O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
Photorhabdus O

however, O

such O
us O

and O
host O
duplication O
of O
bacteria, O
which O
can O
create O
incongruence O
between O

were O
detected O
as O
well. O
In O
contrast O
, O
using O
a O
multigene O
approach, O
Lee O
and O
Stock O
( O
2010b O
) O
found O
little O
evidence O
for O
the O
coevolution O
between O
Xenorhabdus O
bacteria O
and O
Steinernema O
nematodes. O
Furthermore, O
this O
analysis O
suggested O
that O
the O
host O
switching O
of O
the O
microsymbiont O
occurred O
rampantly O
in O
the O
evolutionary O
history O
of O
Xenorhabdus. O
Then, O
several O
studies O
have O
revealed O
cospeciation O
events O
as O
well O
as O
the O
ability O
of O
microsymbionts O
to O
transfer O
between O
distantly O

in O
the O

Bhat O
et O

). O
There O
are O
several O
reasons O
why O
the O
processes O
of O
host O
switching, O
could O
culminate O
in O
the O
evolutionary O
history O
of O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria. O
EPNs O
are O
cosmopolitan O
animals O
often O
coexisting O
in O
the O
same O
ecological O
niche O
(Grewal O
et O
al. O
1994 O
; O
Půža O
and O
Mráček O
2010 O
). O
As O
they O
also O
have O
a O
wide O
insect O
host O
range, O
coinfections O
of O
the O
same O
insect O
by O
more O
than O
one O
EPN O
species O
is O
likely O
to O
occur O
in O
nature O
(Koppenhöfer O
and O
Kaya O
1996 O
; O
Peters O
1996 O
; O
Grewal O
et O
al. O
1997 O
). O
Additionally, O
within O
the O
insect O
host, O
symbiotic O
bacteria O
are O
physically O
separated O
from O
the O
nematode, O
which O
is O
not O
in O
common O
with O
most O
of O
the O
other O
mutualistic O
symbioses, O
where O
partners O
do O
not O
disassociate O
naturally. O
In O
fact, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
co-infection O
of O
an O
insect O
by O
different O
nematodes, O
their O
microsymbionts O
are O
free O
to O
associate O
with O
other O
nematodes O
(Adams O
et O
al. O
2006 O
). O

Such O
high O
adhesiveness O
of O
a O
dairy O
strain O
is O
unexpected, O
as O
strains O
deriving O
from O
milk O
environments O
typically O
display O
weaker O
adhesion O
efficiency O
than O
those O
isolated O
from O

(Douillard O

The O
very O
high O

capacity O
of O

However, O
despite O

some O

Therefore, O
these O

To O
further O

we O
focused O
on O
immuno-metabolic O

At O

the O

a O

that O
at O

in O

the O

was O
similar O

Unfortunately, O
we O
have O
no O
detailed O

such O

This O

may O
be O
a O
worthwhile O
option O
in O
carefully O
selected O
PCD O

with O

More O

to O
elicit O
predisposing O
factors O
for O
the O
favorable O
post-lung O

in O
this O
minority O

The O
major O
strength O
of O
this O
study O
is O
the O
provision O
of O
data O
on O
a O
large, O
representative, O
international O
sample O
of O
PCD O
patients O
who O
underwent O
surgery O
to O
treat O
bronchiectasis, O
demonstrating O
continuing O
lung O

after O

However, O
the O
study O
was O
retrospective O
and O
although O
effort O
was O
made O
to O
collect O
all O
relevant O
data O
based O
on O
a O
predefined O

not O
only O
from O
the O

registry O
but O
also O
by O
contacting O
the O
local O
principal O
investigators O
at O
the O
collaborating O
centers, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
that O
some O
data O
were O
missed. O
In O
addition, O
given O
its O
retrospective O
nature, O
the O
study O
did O
not O
benefit O
from O
a O
standardized O
diagnostic O
protocol O
(not O
all O
PCD O

underwent O
the O
same O

or O
standardized O

testing O
procedures O
as O
described O
by O
the O
ERS/ATS O
recommendations O
[ O
33 O
]. O
The O
multicenter O
nature O
of O
the O
study O
also O
might O
introduce O
center-related O
heterogeneity O
in O
the O
collected O
parameters O
that O
we O
tried O
to O
control O
by O
recruiting O
for O
each O
lobectomised O
patient O
two O
controls O
matched O
for O
age, O
sex O
and O
center, O
although O
this O
was O
not O
possible O
for O
all O
cases. O
Furthermore, O
participating O
patients O
had O
different O
stages O
of O
disease O
and O
underwent O
different O
kinds O
of O
surgical O
intervention, O
introducing O
variabilities O
that O
may O
affect O
the O
outcomes, O
which O
are O
impossible O
to O
assess O
and O
control O
in O
a O
retrospective O
study. O

These O
results O
confirm O
the O
general O
finding O
that O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
contain O
one O
near-invariant O
TM O
domain O
near O
the O
N-terminal O
and O
that O
a O
subset O
of O
the O
proteins O
contains O
a O
second O
TM O
domain O
near O
the O
C-terminus. O
In O
contrast, O
in O
plants O
we O
previously O
found O
that O
out O
of O
&gt; O
1310 O
sequences, O
all O
but O
five O
contained O
just O
a O
single O
TM O

[ O

Note O
that O
although O
the O

we O
also O
used O
several O
additional O

This O

that O
at O

some O
of O

Of O
the O
GPACs, O
F. O

is O
thought O
to O

Its O
particular O
virulence O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
product O
of O
a O

of O

Well O
described O
are: O
the O

Whilst O

superior O

because O

This O

used O
to O
characterize O
non-bacterial O
compartments O
of O
the O

Another O
advantage O

that O

the O

It O
seems O
that O

groups O
in O
Iran O
and O
mandatory O
anti-HBV O

be O
the O

Lower O
prevalence O

HCV O

Shiraz, O
Iran O
(with O

can O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
stringent O
policy O

guidelines O
for O
accurate O
HCV O

14 O
. O
Also O
because O
of O
compulsory O
anti-HCV O

units O
since O
1996, O
the O
transmission O
of O
HCV O
in O
Iranian O

has O
reduced O
remarkably. O
Such O
that O
there O

The O

So, O
the O
prevalence O

The O

identified O
an O
association O
of O
the O

ten O
characteristics O
with O
all O

The O

Moreover, O
two O
characteristics O

by O
way O
of O

However, O

The O

In O

did O
not O
show O

Therefore, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
other O

our O

Basing O

This O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
GF O
mice, O
which O
show O
deficiencies O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
immune O
compartment O
rendering O
them O
more O
susceptible O
to O
infections. O
However, O
such O
deficiencies O
can O
be O
corrected O
by O
colonization O
with O
commensal O
bacteria. O
For O
instance, O
in O
GF O
mice, O
the O
mucus-producing O
goblet O
cells O
are O
fewer O
and O
smaller. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
mucus O
layer, O
the O
first O
line O
of O

against O

in O
the O

is O
thinner O
and O
has O
a O
different O

[ O

Additional O
examples O
of O
GI O
immune O
defects O
in O
GF O
mice O
include: O
1) O

(MLN) O
and O
abnormal O

with O

2) O
fewer O
and O
smaller O
Peyer’s O

which O
lack O
germinal O

[ O

51 O
]; O
and O
3) O
lack O
of O
lymphoid O

in O
the O
intestinal O
lamina O

(LP), O
but O
presence O
of O
nascent O
cryptopatches O
which O
can O
develop O
into O
functional O
isolated O
lymphoid O
follicles O
upon O
microbial O
colonization O
[ O
52 O
– O
54 O
]. O
These O
local O
immune O
deficiencies O
are O
accompanied O
by O
a O
decreased O
number O
of O
LP O
CD4 O

T O
cells, O

and O
decreased O
IgA O
production O
leading O
to O
further O
impaired O
intestinal O

function O
[ O
55 O
, O

]. O
The O
presence O
of O
commensal O
bacteria O
is O
required O
not O
only O
for O
normalizing O
the O
LP O
CD4 O

T O

numbers, O
but O
also O
for O
proper O

of O
the O

GF O

are O
almost O
completely O

Impact O
on O
systemic O

Systemic O
innate O

is O
also O
influenced O
by O
the O
commensal O

with O
multiple O
lines O
of O
evidence O
indicating O

effects O
on O
myelopoiesis O
at O
the O
level O
of O
granulocyte-macrophage O
progenitors O
in O
the O
bone O

and O
in O
the O

as O
well O
as O
on O
the O
function O
of O
DCs, O
macrophages, O
and O
neutrophils O
(reviewed O
in O
[ O

These O
data O
suggest O
that O
in O
homozygous O
mouse O
cells, O
the O
defective O
Pol O
III O
biogenesis O
conferred O
by O
the O
mutant O
POLR3B O
subunit O
may O
underlie O
the O
impaired O
mouse O
embryonic O
development O
phenotype. O
Importantly, O
when O
combined O
with O
our O
previous O
study O
[ O
6 O
], O
our O
data O
suggest O
that O
mutations O
causing O
a O
milder O
effect O
on O
Pol O
III O
function, O
such O
as O
POLR3A O
G672E, O
may O
not O
lead O
to O
a O
phenotype O
in O
mice, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
inter-species O
differences O
in O
myelination O
[ O
6 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
some O
mutations O
that O
affect O
Pol O
III O
complex O
assembly O
or O
nuclear O
import O
and O
that O
are O
generally O
seen O
as O
compound O
heterozygous O
alleles O
in O
humans O
may O
be O
too O
severe O
in O
the O
homozygous O
state, O
thus O
preventing O
embryonic O
development. O
Indeed, O
numerous O
POLR3-HLD O
cases O
with O
compound O
heterozygous O
alleles O
are O
known O
to O
include O
one O
allele O
with O
a O
frameshift O
or O
nonsense O
mutation O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Since O
we O
have O
only O
studied O
two O
mutations O
thus O
far, O
further O
experiments O
on O
other O
POLR3A O
and O
POLR3B O
mutations O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
confirm O
such O
a O
correlation. O
This O
does O
not O
preclude O
that O
other O
mutations, O
perhaps O
ones O
that O
have O
a O
moderate O
effect O
on O
chromatin O
occupancy O
or O
transcription O
elongation, O
might O
lead O
to O
a O
clinical O
mouse O
phenotype O
recapitulating O
the O
human O
disease. O
We O
recently O
showed O
that O
in O
human O
cell O
lines, O
the O
POLR3-HLD-causing O
POLR3A O
M862 O
V O
mutation O
does O
not O
impair O
Pol O
III O
complex O
assembly O
or O
nuclear O
import O
but O
leads O
to O
decreased O
levels O
of O
a O
subset O
of O
Pol O
III O
transcripts, O
including O
tRNAs O
and O
7SL O
RNA O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Thus, O
this O
mutation O
appears O
to O
have O
an O
intermediate O
functional O
phenotype O
in O
human O
cells O
that O
could O
perhaps O
lead O
to O
a O
neurological O
phenotype O
in O
mouse. O
Examining O
the O
functional O
impact O
of O
a O
larger O
panel O
of O
mutations O
in O
human O
cells O
could O
help O
pinpoint O
those O
that O
may O
produce O
a O
mouse O
phenotype, O
though O
mouse O
brain O
development O
may O
be O
less O
susceptible O
than O
the O
human O
brain O
to O
the O
impact O
of O
such O
mutations. O

In O
regions O
where O
it O
is O
suitable O
as O
a O
winter O
grain, O
barley O
establishes O
rapidly O
in O
the O
fall O
and O
can O
out-compete O
annual O
winter O
weeds. O
Because O
of O
its O
quick O
canopy O
growth O
after O
seeding, O
barley O
can O
be O
quite O
competitive O
against O
weeds. O
Many O
diseases O
and O
insects O
that O
affect O
barley O
are O
regionally O
specific, O
but O
this O
pressure O
can O
generally O
be O
managed O
effectively O
using O
integrated O
pest O
management O
strategies. O
However, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
most O
currently O
available O
varieties O
have O
been O
selected O
for O
conventional O
growing O
conditions O
and O
many O
may O
not O
always O
be O
the O
best O
suited O
for O
organic O
farming O
conditions; O
breeding O
new O
varieties O
under O
organic O
conditions O
can O
help O
remedy O
this. O
Barley O
offers O
some O
advantages O
over O
other O
small O
grains: O
it O
requires O
less O
nitrogen O
than O
wheat O
and O
matures O
more O
quickly O
than O
other O
small O
grains, O
which O
allows O
subsequent O
crops O
to O
be O
planted O
earlier O
(Wiersma O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Because O
it O
can O
be O
malted O
for O
brewing O
and O
distilling, O
eaten O
as O
a O
food O
grain, O
and O
fed O
to O
livestock, O
barley O
provides O
diverse O
marketing O
options. O
It O
can O
also O
be O
intercropped O
with O
legumes, O
which O
gives O
producers O
the O
option O
to O
till O
it O
in O
as O
a O
green O
manure O
cover O
crop, O
harvest O
before O
maturity O
as O
a O
green O
chop O
fed O
to O
livestock, O
or O
grow O
to O
maturity O
to O
market O
as O
a O
mixed O
feed O
grain, O
depending O
on O
soil O
needs O
and O
market O
conditions. O
Despite O
its O
benefits, O
many O
organic O
farmers O
have O
been O
reluctant O
to O
plant O
barley. O
New O
varieties O
bred O
for O
organic O
systems O
that O
meet O
quality O
standards O
to O
be O
sold O
into O
multiple O
markets O
may O
encourage O
farmers O
to O
add O
barley O
to O
their O
rotation. O
In O
principle, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
breed O
a O
naked O
barley O
suitable O
for O
feed, O
food, O
and O
malting O
that O
will O
perform O
well O
in O
organic O
systems O
(Meints O
and O
Hayes O
2019 O
). O
In O
order O
to O
inform O
the O
breeding O
process O
and O
to O
understand O
what O
qualities, O
traits, O
and O
characteristics O
organic O
farmers O
consider O
important, O
the O
authors O
designed O
and O
implemented O
a O
survey O
and O
conducted O
interviews O
of O
organic O
barley O
producers. O
Materials O
and O
methods O
The O
investigators O
drafted O
a O
survey O
instrument O
that O
was O
pre-tested O
by O
one O
organic O
barley O
producer O
in O
each O
of O
the O
USDA’s O
Northeast, O
North O
Central, O
and O
Western O
regions, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
project O
cooperators O
at O
Cornell O
University O
and O
Oregon O
State O
University. O
The O
final O
instrument O
contained O
29 O
questions O
and O
was O
designed O
to O
take O
less O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
complete. O

The O
TRs O
Rv0324 O
and O
Rv0880 O
comprise O
the O
tolerance O
network O
to O
the O
recently O
marketed O
antitubercular O
drug, O
bedaquiline O
(Peterson O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
WhiB7 O
shows O
a O
more O
generic O
spectrum O
controlling O
the O
expression O
of O
a O
plethora O
of O
antibiotic O
resistant O
genes, O
such O
as O
tap O
(Rv1258c) O
coding O
for O
an O
efflux O
pump O
that O
provides O
low-level O
resistance O
to O
aminoglycosides O
and O
tetracycline O
or O

(Rv O

homologous O
to O

). O
Figure O

shows O
that O
overproduction O
of O
SigB O
and O
SigE O
had O
little O
effect O
on O
expression O
levels O
of O
Mtb O
CYPs O
and O
redox O
partners. O
In O
contrast, O
cyp130a1 O
was O
slightly O
upregulated. O
The O
same O
holds O
true O
for O
overproduction O
of O
the O
TRs O
Rv0324 O
and O
Rv0880 O
(both O
involved O
in O
bedaquiline O
tolerance) O
which O
are O
both O
result O
in O
upregulation O
of O
cyp128a1, O
cyp137a1, O
fdxE, O
and O
fprB. O
Moreover, O
overproduction O
of O
WhiB7 O
led O
to O
increased O
transcripts O
of O
cyp128a1, O
cyp130a1, O
and O
fdxA, O
suggesting O
that O
they O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
dealing O
with O
the O
stress O
consequent O
to O
bedaquiline O
exposure O
(Fig. O

) O
(Rustad O
et O

). O
Interestingly, O
expression O
of O
some O
of O
these O
TRs, O
such O
as O
whiB7, O
is O
upregulated O
by O
antibiotic O
treatment, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
certain O
(physiological) O
stresses O
including O
iron O
starvation O
and O
heat O

(Geiman O

In O

obstacles O
to O
growing O
high-quality O
barley. O
The O
interviews O
were O
structured O
in O
three O
parts. O
The O
first O
was O
a O
narrative O
description O
about O
how O
barley O
fits O
into O
the O
interviewee’s O
rotation O
and O
farming O
system. O
The O
second O
involved O
detailed O
information O
on O
their O
practices, O
operations, O
costs O
of O
production, O
and O
returns O
for O
growing O
barley. O
The O
third O
part O
was O
open-ended O
and O
gave O
the O
interviewees O
an O
opportunity O
to O
explain O
their O
needs O
and O
preferences O
for O
barley O
traits O
in O
greater O
detail. O
The O
interviewees O
were O
asked O
in-depth O
questions O
that O
expanded O
on O
the O
questions O
presented O
in O
the O
survey O
and O
provided O
greater O
detail O
about O
production O
obstacles O
and O
how O
barley O
breeding O
could O
help O
overcome O
those O
challenges. O
Interview O
subjects O
were O
asked O
to O
provide O
detailed O
information O
about O
their O
farming O
operations. O
Actual O
cost O
data O
were O
used O
when O
readily O
available. O
If O
the O
producers O
could O
not O
directly O
provide O
costs O
of O
production, O
the O
data O
provided O
about O
farming O
operations O
were O
used O
to O
estimate O
equipment O
fuel, O
operation, O
and O
maintenance O
costs O
based O
on O
the O
manufacturer’s O
specifications, O
engineering O
references, O
and O
the O
most O
recent O
edition O
of O
relevant O
Cooperative O
Extension O
data O
(Downs O
and O
Hansen O
1998 O
; O
Grisso O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Painter O
2011 O
). O
Capital O
recovery O
of O
machinery O
and O
equipment O
and O
other O
allocated O
overhead O
expenses O
not O
provided O
by O
the O
interviewees O
were O
extrapolated O
from O
the O
regional O
averages O
provided O
by O
the O
USDA O
Survey O
of O
barley O
producers O
following O
the O
2014 O
Census O
of O
Agriculture O
(USDA O
/ O
NASS O
2019 O
). O
Interviewees O
were O
asked O
about O
their O
land O
costs, O
including O
cash O
rent, O
mortgage O
payments, O
and O
property O
taxes. O
In O
cases O
where O
actual O
rents O
or O
total O
cost O
of O
land O
and O
net O
of O
buildings O
and O
improvement O
was O
not O
available, O
rents O
reported O
by O
the O
most O
recent O
USDA O
survey O
on O
land O
rents O
by O
county O
were O
used O
for O
the O
opportunity O
cost O
of O
land O
(USDA O
NASS O

). O

Therefore, O
RssR O
positively O
regulates O
MI O
utilization O
by O
targeting O
reiD O
and O
promotes O
growth O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium O
in O
environments O
with O
MI O
as O
a O
carbon O
and O
energy O
source. O
Although O
the O
deletion O
of O
sRNA O
STnc1740 O
has O
a O
less O
prominent O
growth O
effect O
in O
comparison O
with O
that O
of O
RssR, O
its O
growth O
phenotype O
indicates O
that O
STnc1740 O
counteracts O
the O
effect O
of O
RssR O
by O
a O
yet O
unknown O
mechanism. O
There O
is O
increasing O
evidence O
that O
the O
capacity O
to O
degrade O
MI O
might O
contribute O
to O
the O
survival, O
colonization O
and O
growth O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium O
in O
several O
hosts O
14 O
, O
19 O
– O
21 O
, O
28 O
, O
60 O
. O
Interestingly, O
a O
transposon-directed O
insertion-site O
sequencing O
(TraDIS) O
application O
identified O
a O
transposon O
mutation O
in O
rssR O
to O
attenuate O
S. O
Typhimurium O
growth O
following O
oral O
infection O
of O
calves, O
chickens, O
and O
pigs O
21 O
. O
The O
long O
lag O
phase O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium O
during O
growth O
with O
MI O
might O
place O
doubt O
on O
the O
possible O
relevance O
of O
MI O
utilization O
during O
infection. O
However, O
the O
tight O
regulation O
of O
this O
metabolic O
pathway O
can O
in O
part O
be O
overcome O
by O
bicarbonate, O
which O
is O
present O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
as O
demonstrated O
recently O
24 O
. O
Alternatively, O
as O
hypothesized O
here, O
the O
MI O
metabolism O
might O
be O
supported O
by O
the O
common O
virulence O
regulator O
SsrB. O
SsrB O
has O
also O
been O
identified O
to O
induce O
srfJ O
that O
is O
located O
on O
the O
MI O
degradation O
island O
41 O
, O
61 O
, O
62 O
. O
Together O
with O
the O
sensor O
SsrA O
(SpiR), O
the O
response O
regulator O
SsrB O
forms O
a O
two-component O
system O
that O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
induction O
of O
the O
SPI-2 O
located O
type O
III O
secretion O
system O
and O
effector O
proteins O
essential O
for O
survival O
in O
macrophages O
63 O
. O
In O
our O
study, O
we O
confirm O
the O
observation O
that O
SsrB O
binds O
to O
a O
site O
within O
GEI4417/4436 O
38 O
, O
namely O
the O
rssR O
promoter, O
and O
demonstrate O
that O
SsrB O
can O
activate O
the O
novel O
sRNA O
RssR, O
but O
is O
not O
required O
for O
RssR O
expression O
in O
medium O
with O
MI O
as O
sole O
carbon O
and O
energy O
source. O

In O
1995, O
UTI O
costs O
were O
estimated O
at O
$1.6 O
billion O
in O
the O
USA O
($659 O
million O
in O
direct O
costs O
and O
$936 O
million O
in O
indirect O
costs) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
direct O
cost O
per O
patient O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
between O
112 O
and O
172 O
dollars O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
France, O
these O
costs O
are O
unknown. O
The O
main O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
calculate O
the O
direct O
and O
indirect O
UTI O
costs O
(including O
cystitis O
and O
acute O
pyelonephritis) O
in O
women O
over O
18 O
years O
of O
age O
who O
visit O
general O
practices O
in O
France. O
The O
secondary O
objectives O
were O
to O
calculate O
the O
costs O
of O
suspected O
UTIs O
with O
negative O
urine O
cultures O
and O
to O
compare O
the O
costs O
of O
UTIs O
due O
to O
antibiotic-resistant O
E. O

with O
those O
of O
UTIs O
due O

Methods O
Population O
The O
data O
were O
collected O
during O
the O
Drug O
Resistance O
in O
Community O
Urinary O
Tract O
Infection O
(Druti) O
survey. O
The O
Druti O
was O
a O
national O
cross-sectional O
survey O
that O
was O
conducted O
in O
France O
between O
January O
2012 O
and O
February O
2013 O
by O
general O
practitioners O
(GP) O
of O
the O
Sentinelles O
network O
[ O
13 O
]. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
survey O
was O
to O
estimate O
the O
annual O
incidence O
of O
UTIs O
due O
to O
antibiotic-resistant O
bacteria O
in O
women O
who O
visited O
GPs O
for O
suspected O
UTIs O
[ O
14 O
]. O
A O
two-stage O
sampling O
design O
that O
has O
been O
described O
elsewhere O
[ O
14 O
] O
was O
applied. O
The O
eligible O
patients O
were O
females O
over O
18 O
years O
old O
who O
presented O
within O
the O
previous O
7 O
days O
with O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
following O
symptoms: O
dysuria O
and O
frequent O
or O
urgent O
of O
urination O
(Additional O

). O
The O
patients O
who O
agreed O
to O
participate O
and O
had O
not O
taken O
antibiotics O
within O
the O
prior O
7 O
days O
were O
included. O
Data O
available O
For O
each O
patient, O
a O
urine O
sample O
was O
collected, O
and O
urine O
cultures O
were O
performed O
on O
all O
samples O
in O
the O
same O
laboratory. O
The O
urine O
samples O
were O
analyzed, O
and O
the O
antimicrobial O
susceptibilities O
were O
tested. O
The O
bacteriological O
methods O
are O
described O
elsewhere O
[ O
15 O
, O
16 O
]. O
The O
GPs O
were O
blinded O
to O
the O
urine O
culture O
results. O
When O
needed, O
the O
GPs O
prescribed O
another O
urine O
culture. O

To O
date, O
detailed O
knowledge O
of O
the O
molecular O
bases O
underlying O
SB O
resistance O
in O
L. O
ervoides O
is O
still O
lacking O
and O
the O
only O
available O
information O
is O
the O
presence O
of O
three O
quantitative O
trait O
loci O
(QTLs) O
associated O
with O
SB O
on O
a O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphism O
(SNP) O
-based O
linkage O
map O
of O
an O
F O
9 O
recombinant O
inbred O
line O
(RIL) O
population O
of O
L. O
ervoides O
[ O
11 O
]. O
Despite O
the O
identification O
and O
localization O
of O
these O
QTLs, O
their O
direct O
use O
in O
marker-assisted O
selection O
is O
limited O
and O
identification O
of O
candidate O
resistance O
genes O
is O
difficult O
because O
those O
QTL O
intervals O
(2-LOD) O
are O
relatively O
large O
(6 O
to O
21 O
MB) O
and O
contain O
hundreds O
of O
genes O
[ O
11 O
]. O
A O
functional O
understanding O
of O
SB O
resistance O
has O
been O
largely O
developed O
in O
model O
plants O
such O
as O
tomato O
(Solanum O
lycopersicum O
L.) O
and O
Arabidopsis O
thaliana O
(L.) O
Heynh. O
In O
tomato, O
Yang O
et O
al. O
[ O
12 O
] O
mapped O
a O
single O
dominant O
locus O
in O
a O
260 O
Kb O
chromosomal O
region O
conferring O
resistance O
to O
SB O
(caused O
by O
S. O
lycopersici O
(Enjoji) O
W. O
Yamam.) O
and O
identified O
two O
putative O
resistance O
genes O
coding O
for O
a O
cysteine-rich O
receptor-like O
kinase O
(CRK) O
and O
a O
receptor-like O
kinase O
(RLK). O
This O
indicated O
that O
resistance O
in O
tomato O
was O
likely O
mediated O
via O
the O
recognition O
between O
plant O
and O
pathogen. O
In O
A. O
thaliana, O
Di O
et O
al. O
[ O
13 O
] O
reported O
that O
a O
gene O
encoding O
polygalactoronase-inhibiting O
protein O
(PGIP) O
was O
upregulated O
during O
the O
S. O
solani O
infection O
period. O
As O
PGIP O
belongs O
to O
a O
large O
family O
of O
leucine-rich O
repeat O
(LRR) O
proteins, O
it O
was O
suspected O
that O
a O
hypersensitive O
response O
(HR) O
may O
affect O
SB O
resistance O
in O
A. O
thaliana O
[ O
13 O
]. O
However, O
due O
to O
the O
highly O
complex O
nature O
of O
resistances O
to O
necrotrophic O
pathogens, O
it O
is O
still O
unknown O
if O
these O
mechanisms O
can O
be O
extended O
to O
other O
plant O
species. O

The O
ankA O
gene O
identifies O
some O
of O
the O
same O
correlation O
to O
host O
species O
as O
groEL O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Both O
methods O
group O
sequences O
so O
that O
roe O
deer O
is O
probably O
not O
the O
major O
reservoir O
of O
granulocytic O
anaplasmosis O
in O
humans O
and O
domestic O
animals, O
and O
that O
red O
deer O
could O
be O
the O
reservoir O
for O
that O
ecotype. O
A O
limitation O
of O
our O
methodology O
is O
that O
co-infection O
of O
ecotypes O
would O
not O
be O
discovered. O
The O
high O
infection O
prevalence O
of O
both O
ecotypes O
in O
moose O
makes O
it O
likely O
that O
mixed O
infections O
can O
be O
common. O
This O
could O
be O
addressed O
with O
other O
methods O
such O
as O
Reverse O
Line O
Blot O
in O
future O
work. O
Obtaining O
sequence O
data O
from O
positive O
samples O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
required O
for O
determination O
of O
ecotype O
can O
be O
challenging. O
We O
had O
a O
fairly O
low O
success O
(42–57%) O
in O
obtaining O
sequence O
data, O
and O
the O
sequencing O
success O
was O
good O
when O
Ct O
values O
(i.e. O
the O
number O
of O
PCR O
cycles O
before O
getting O
a O
positive O
signal) O
were O
below O
30. O
This O
highlights O
the O
need O
for O
large O
sample O
sizes. O
There O
are O
only O
two O
previous O
groEL O
sequences O
reported O
from O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
isolated O
from O
moose O
tissue. O
One O
sequence O
derived O
from O
a O
mainland O
moose O
in O
Sweden O
was O
an O
exact O
match O
of O
the O
sequence O
(GQ988754) O
from O
roe O
deer O
in O
Austria O
[ O
39 O
] O
clustering O
to O
ecotype O
II, O
while O
the O
sequence O
derived O
from O
a O
moose O
from O
the O
Island O
of O
Öland, O
Sweden O
clustered O
to O
ecotype O
I O
[ O
15 O
]. O
There O
are O
no O
red O
deer O
on O
Öland, O
but O
still O
ecotype O
I O
was O
found O
there. O
Together O
with O
our O
discovery O
of O
frequent O
infection O
of O
ecotype O
I O
in O
moose, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
questing O
ticks O
in O
an O
area O
without O
red O
deer, O
this O
is O
indeed O
indicative O
of O
moose O
as O
a O
potential O
transmission O
host O
of O
ecotype O
I. O
Conclusion O
Our O
study O
provides O
one O
crucial O
step O
forward O
towards O
identifying O
assumed O
transmission O
hosts O
at O
the O
northern O
distribution O
ranges, O
and O
we O
have O
provided O
the O
first O
results O
potentially O
linking O
moose O
to O
both O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum. O

Though O
at O
resting O
state, O
CD4 O
+ O
and O
CD8 O
+ O
subsets O
show O
similar O
metabolic O
profiles, O
CD4 O
+ O
T O
cells O
upregulate O
oxidative O
metabolism O
with O
higher O
expression O
of O
IDH2 O
and O
ATP5A, O
as O
well O
as O
GLUT1. O
In O
contrast, O
CD8 O
+ O
T O
cells O
augment O
their O
capacity O
for O

through O
the O
PPP O
with O
higher O
G6PD O
expression O
(Fig. O
2b O
, O
Supplementary O
Fig. O
3f O
). O
This O
confirmed O
that O
T-cell O
activation O
requires O
remodeling O
of O
the O
metabolic O
state O
that O
is O
specific O
to O
functional O
T-cell O
subsets O
31 O
. O
Together, O
Met-Flow O
confirmed O
previously O
described O
metabolic O
inductions O
of O
glycolysis, O
OXPHOS O
and O
fatty-acid O
synthesis O
in O
activated O
T O
cells O
1 O
, O
32 O
– O
34 O
. O
This O
technique O
enabled O
associations O
of O
glycolysis O
and O
immune O
activation O
on O
a O
single-cell O
level, O
by O
elucidating O
the O
positive O
correlation O
between O
GLUT1 O
and O
CD25 O
expression. O
The O
data O
further O
demonstrated O
reprogramming O
of O
other O
pathways, O
including O
key O
enzymes O
in O
mitochondrial O
respiration, O
PPP, O
and O
fatty-acid O
oxidation, O
that O
contribute O
to O
the O
metabolic O
state O
of O
activated O
T O
cells. O
Glycolytic O
inhibition O
alters O
T-cell O
metabolism O
and O
activation O
Previous O
analysis O
of O
global O
metabolic O
reprograming O
showed O
an O
increased O
capacity O
for O
glucose O
uptake O
and O
glycolysis, O
associated O
with O
T-cell O
activation. O
Therefore, O
we O
investigated O
the O
dependence O
on O
glycolytic O
metabolism O
for O
the O
immuno-metabolic O
state. O
The O
glucose O
analog O
2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose O
(2-FDG) O
was O
added O
in O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
anti-CD3/28 O
stimulation O
in O
purified O
T O
cells. O
2-FDG O
is O
a O
closer O
analog O
to O
glucose O
than O
2-DG, O
is O
less O
toxic, O
more O
specific, O
and O
does O
not O
interfere O
with O
mannose O
metabolism O
by O
incorporating O
into O
N-linked O
glycosylation O
35 O
– O
38 O
. O
We O
determined O
that O
24 O
h O
of O
2-FDG O
alone O
did O
not O
cause O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
any O
metabolic O
pathways O
(Fig. O

result O

Weight O

were O
obtained O

Survey O
results O
All O
respondents O
were O
certified O
organic, O
with O
69% O
farming O
their O
entire O
operation O
organically O
and O
31% O
split O
operations. O
The O
responses O
were O
geographically O
diverse, O
with O
farmers O
from O
every O
USDA O
region O
responding. O
The O
region O
with O
the O
greatest O
number O
of O
respondents O
(43) O
was O
the O
Western O
region, O
which O
accounted O
for O
almost O
half O
the O
responses. O
This O
was O
followed O
by O
the O
North O
Central O
(24) O
and O
Northeast O
regions O
(14), O
with O
only O
three O
respondents O
from O
the O
Southern O
region. O
The O
distribution O
of O
income O
for O
organic O
barley O
producers O
responding O
was O
skewed O
towards O
higher O
income O
than O
the O
national O
census O
figures. O
For O
example, O
75% O
of O
all O
US O
farms O
in O
2017 O
reported O
farm O
income O
of O
less O
than O
$50,000 O
compared O
with O
only O
19% O
of O
the O
respondents O
from O
this O
survey O
(USDA O

Stronger O

of O

consistent O
with O
other O

[ O

The O
anti-proliferative O
effect O
of O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
on O
the O
cell O
lines O
in O
vitro O
was O
most O
pronounced O
for O
DOHH-2, O
which O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
higher O
CD37 O
expression O
on O
DOHH-2 O
compared O
to O
REC-1. O
In O
REC-1 O
the O
cytotoxic O
effect O
of O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
differed O
only O
slightly O
from O
that O
of O
lutetium-177 O
labelled O
unspecific O
antibody. O
This O
unspecific O
effect O
was O
probably O
due O
to O
cross-irradiation O
from O
unbound O
conjugate O
during O
the O
incubation O
period O
before O
washing O
the O
cells O
[ O
30 O
]. O
In O
the O
in O

studies, O
however, O
177 O
Lu-IgG1 O
did O
not O
improve O
survival. O
A O
high O
uptake O
of O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
in O
CD37-expressing O
tumours O
compared O
to O
normal O
organs O
and O
blood O
was O
observed. O
The O
higher O
uptake O
in O
MEC-2 O
tumours O
than O
in O
DOHH-2 O
tumours, O
even O
though O
the O
CD37 O
expression O
was O
similar, O
might O
be O
explained O
by O
higher O
degree O
of O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
internalisation O
in O
MEC-2 O
cells O
(Online O

Table O
S1 O
). O
Biodistribution O
and O
dosimetry O
were O
not O
performed O
for O
REC-1, O
but O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
expect O
similar O
results O
for O
this O
animal O
model. O
In O
an O
i.v. O
REC-1 O
xenograft O
model, O
CB17 O
SCID O
mice O
treated O
with O
177 O
Lu-NNV003 O
showed O
prolonged O
survival O
compared O
to O
controls. O
Some O
efficacy O
was O
also O
observed O
with O
NNV003, O
probably O
due O
to O
an O
immunotherapeutic O
effect O
of O
the O
antibody. O
In O
another O
i.v. O
model O
using O
DOHH-2 O
cells, O
the O
anti-tumour O
effect O
of O
NNV003 O
was O
equal O
to O
the O
effect O
of O

we O
assessed O
real-time O

using O

which O
analyses O
glycolytic O

As O
expected, O
CD3/28 O

induced O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O

with O
elevated O
basal O

and O

compared O
with O
untreated O
controls O
(Fig. O

Mitochondrial O
respiration O
was O
significantly O
impacted, O
revealing O
enhanced O
basal, O
maximal O
respiration, O
and O
spare O
mitochondrial O

(Fig. O

). O
These O
metabolic O
shifts O
in O
glycolysis O
and O

confirmed O
our O

(Fig. O

Moreover, O
these O

We O
next O
evaluated O
the O

The O

Discussion O
Three O
general O
observations O
can O
be O
made O
from O
our O
analysis O
of O
the O
distribution O
of O
CLO/PXG-like O
sequences O
in O
fungal O
genomes. O
First O
, O
this O
gene O
family O
is O
present O
in O
all O
the O
major O
fungal O
groups O
from O
the O
most O
primitive O
to O
the O
most O
recently O
evolved. O
Interestingly, O
CLO/PXG-like O
sequences O
are O
present O
in O
the O
two O
basal O
clades, O
Microsporidia O
and O
Cryptomycota, O
which O
have O
only O
very O
recently O
(and, O
to O
date, O
not O
unanimously) O
been O
accepted O
as O
likely O
members O
of O
the O
Fungi O
[ O
89 O
– O
94 O
]. O
Second O
, O
the O
CLO/PXG-like O
protein O
sequences O
are O
generally O
well O
conserved O
and O
their O
major O
canonical O
motifs O
(see O
below) O
are O
strikingly O
similar O
to O
orthologs O
that O
are O
highly O
abundant O
in O
the O
Viridiplantae O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Third O
, O
and O
unlike O
most O
of O
the O
Viridiplantae O
groups, O
CLO/PXG-like O
sequences O
are O
absent O
from O
a O
large O
proportion O
(about O
70%) O
of O
currently O
sequenced O
fungal O
genomes. O
In O
a O
few O
cases, O
such O
as O
the O
Orbiliomycetes O
and O
Lecanoromycetes, O
current O
information O
indicates O
that O
the O
genes O
are O
absent O
from O
an O
entire O
class O
of O
fungi. O
However, O
in O
these O
classes O
only O
a O
few O
species O
have O
so O
far O
been O
sequenced O
so O
it O
might O
be O
the O
case O
that O
CLO/PXG-like O
genes O
are O
in O
fact O
present O
in O
some O
members O
of O
all O
fungal O
classes. O
In O
many O
other O
cases, O
such O
as O
in O
the O
important O
genera, O
Aspergillus, O
Penicillium O
and O
Colletotrichum, O
the O
genes O
are O
present O
in O
one O
or O
more O
members O
of O
each O
genus O
but O
are O
absent O
from O
close O
relatives O
in O
the O
same O
genus. O

In O

in O
the O

their O

are O
free O
to O

(Adams O

In O
this O

it O
is O
suggested O
that O
host O

an O
evolutionary O
phenomenon O
responsible O
for O
the O

Initially, O
the O

classify O
them O
into O
two O

(Thomas O

). O
Subsequently, O
a O
polyphasic O
approach O
was O
introduced O
to O
classify O
prokaryotes O
based O
on O
integration O
of O
different O
kinds O
of O

data. O
It O

A O
recent O
study O
[ O

found O
that O
LDH O
can O
be O
recognized O
as O
an O
important O
predictive O
factor O
for O
severe O
COVID-19 O
manifestations. O
It O
must O
be O
emphasized O
that O
during O
the O
2009 O

A O
(H1N1) O
pandemic, O
77.8% O
of O
patients O
whose O
laboratory O

indicated O
elevation O
of O
LDH, O
had O

suggesting O
that O
LDH O
elevation O
was O
associated O
with O
multiple O
pathogenic O
factors O
including O
viruses, O
and O
was O
important O
to O

[ O
20 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
Henry O
et O
al. O
[ O
19 O
] O
recently O
demonstrated O
that O
elevated O
LDH O
values O
were O
associated O
with O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
severe O
disease O
(sixfold O
increase) O
and O
mortality O
(16-fold O
increase). O
CRP O
level O
significantly O
increases O
in O
COVID-19 O
patients O
due O
to O
inflammatory O
reaction O
and O
tissue O
destruction. O
High O
concentrations O
of O
CRP O
were O
reported O
to O
indicate O
more O
severe O
illness-, O
associated O
with O
lung O
damage O
and O
worse O
prognosis O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
CRP O
values O
in O
other O
viral O
diseases, O
such O
as O
H1N1 O
influenza, O
were O
higher O
for O
patients O
with O
a O
serious O
history O
of O
the O
disease O
[ O
23 O
]. O
According O
to O
our O
results, O
LDH O
and O
CRP O
are O
major O
predictors O
of O
a O
positive O
CXR: O
in O
presence O
of O
both O
values O
above O
the O
respective O
threshold O
of O
30 O
mg/L O
and O
500 O
U/L O
respectively, O
the O
CXR O
is O
positive O
in O
about O
90% O
of O
the O
patients. O
This O
is O
also O
in O
line O
with O
the O
findings O
of O
Guan O
et O
al. O
[ O
9 O
] O
on O
the O
higher O
frequency O
of O
positive O
CXR O
in O
patients O
with O
a O
more O
severe O
disease. O
The O
overall O
scenario O
of O
our O
findings O
suggests O
that O
baseline O
CXR, O
when O
integrated O
with O
laboratory O
evaluations, O
can O
have O
a O
role O
in O
the O
identification O
of O
patients O
with O
more O
severe O
involvement O
of O
the O
pathology. O
This O
integrated O
approach O
may O
be O
a O
valid O
alternative O
when O
or O
where O
other O
more O

we O
investigated O
different O

the O

To O
distinguish O
subset-specific O
metabolic O

T-cell O

were O
gated O
using O

to O
identify O

Using O

the O
10 O
metabolic O

(Fig. O

We O

based O
on O
their O
immuno-metabolic O

whereas O
naive O

showed O
some O

(Fig. O

The O

in O

We O

increased O

(Fig. O

Moreover, O
there O
is O
a O

which O
may O
be O
a O

These O

For O

Micromussa O
Veron, O
2000 O
(Lobophylliidae), O
is O
an O
Indo-Pacific O
genus O
with O
type O
species O
Acanthastrea O
amakusensis O
Veron, O
1990 O
, O
from O
Amakusa O
Island, O
Japan. O
Possessing O
gross O
morphological O
characteristics O
similar O
to O
the O
Indo-Pacific O
genus O
Acanthastrea O
Milne O
Edwards O
&amp; O
Haime, O
1848, O
it O
was O
initially O
recognised O
as O
a O
separate O
genus O
due O
to O
the O
smaller O
corallite O
diameter O
of O
≤8 O
mm O
for O
its O
first O
members—M. O
minuta O
(Moll O

Best, O
1984), O
M. O
amakusensis, O
and O
M. O
diminuta O
Veron, O
2000 O
(Veron O
2000 O
). O
The O
genus O
was O
later O
said O
to O
be O
established O
‘to O
include O
species O
of O
Acanthastrea O
with O
corallites O
less O
than O
5 O
mm O
diameter’ O
(Veron O
2002 O
: O

Interestingly, O
a O
digenean O
trematode O
infection O
was O
found O
in O
a O
deceased O
yellow-bellied O
toad O
(Bombina O
variegata), O
showing O
clinical O
symptoms, O
including O
hydrocoeloma, O
generalized O
edema, O
and O
pathohistological O
findings, O
such O
as O
hepatitis, O
enteritis, O
nephritis, O
and O
a O
bacterial O
co-infection O
(Citrobacter O
spp. O
+). O
Amphibians O
represent O
not O
only O
intermediate O
hosts O
for O
various O
digenean O
trematode O
orders O
(e.g., O
Amphistomida, O
Echinostomatida, O
Gasterostomida, O
Hemiurida, O
Holostomida, O
Plagiorchida) O
but O
also O
second O
or O
even O
final O
hosts. O
Nevertheless, O
trematode-driven O
pathological O
effects O
are O
mostly O
unknown O
for O
amphibians O
(Mutschmann O
2010 O
). O
Since O
many O
of O
examined O
amphibians O
in O
this O
study O
are O
considered O
as O
threatened O
endemic O
species O
of O
neotropical O
regions, O
e.g., O
Adelphobates O
galactonotus, O
Phyllomedusa O
bicolor, O
and O
Trachycephalus O
resinifictrix, O
and O
thus O
being O
kept O
as O
zoo O
animals O
for O
conversation O
reasons, O
detected O
parasites O
in O
these O
animals O
might O
represent O
imported O
parasites O
from O
their O
natural O
tropical O
habitats. O
Therefore, O
it O
seems O
noteworthy O
to O
mention O
that O
new O
wild O
amphibians O
introduced O
into O
zoological O
gardens O
should O
undergo O
a O
mandatory O
quarantine O
regime O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
further O
spread O
of O
neozoan O
parasites O
as O
suggested O
elsewhere O
(Hallinger O
et O
al. O
2019 O
; O
2020 O
). O
Interestingly, O
parasitic O
infection O
rates O
in O
investigated O
anurans O
(51.12%) O
were O
significantly O
higher O
than O
the O
ones O
observed O
in O
caudate O
species O
(12.88%). O
As O
proposed O
for O
zoo O
animals, O
it O
is O
also O
recommended O
that O
newly O
purchased O
frogs, O
newts, O
and O
toads O
by O
private O
owners O
should O
be O
submitted O
to O
parasitological O
examination O
in O
order O
to O
detect O
presence O
of O
gastrointestinal O
parasites O
during O
quarantine O
as O
a O
routine O
health O
screening. O

Targeted O
selective O
breeding O
programs, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
are O
by O
definition O
reducing O
genetic O
diversity O
by O
selecting O
from O
the O
surviving O
phenotypes O
only O
those O
of O
their O
preference O
of O
chosen O
traits, O
thereby O
potentially O
excluding O
many O
of O
the O
phenotypes O
despite O
their O
shown O
capability O
of O
survival O
(Uzunov O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
DBBB O
selection O
follows O
the O
natural O
seasonal O
reproduction O
cycle O
of O
honey O
bee O
colonies, O
mimicking O
swarming O
by O
splitting O
colonies. O
Consequently, O
the O
population O
not O
only O
preserves O
its O
genetic O
diversity, O
but O
also O
its O
associated O
diverse O
biome O
(both O
favourable O
and O
unfavourable O
associated O
organisms; O
bacteria, O
yeasts, O
fungi, O
viruses, O
mites, O
etc.,) O
which O
fosters O
development O
of O
less O
virulent O
host–parasite O
relationships O
(Neumann O
and O
Blacquière O
2017 O
; O
Blacquière O
and O
Panziera O
2018 O
). O
This O
also O
precludes O
a O
next O
generation O
queen O
being O
confronted O
with O
a O
completely O
new O
biotic O
environment O
(colony O
plus O
biota). O
Vice O
versa O
it O
prevents O
colony O
offspring O
(plus O
biota) O
being O
exposed O
to O
a O
foreign O
young O
queen O
(queen O
+ O
possible O
biota). O
Below O
we O
describe O
the O
practical O
principles O
and O
methods O
used O
in O
the O
approach, O
which O
we O
actively O
advocate O
to O
use O
wherever O
possible O
in O
a O
well-structured O
manner. O
Preconditions O

The O

with O
a O
population O
of O
25–30 O
genetically O
diverse O
local O
colonies O
(from O
different O
beekeepers) O
from O
one O
region. O
This O
enables O
ample O
variation O
and O
conserves O
local/regional O
adaptation O
in O
the O
population O
(genotype–environment O

Büchler O

After O

into O
four O

(see O
Procedure O

in O
the O

once, O
when O
the O

have O
started O
laying O

and O
prior O

by O

The O

and O
which O
show O
good O

will O
be O
the O

the O

In O
mid-winter, O
when O

a O

How O

have O
a O
poor O
treatment O
response O
to O
gentamicin, O
berberine, O

furoxone O
[ O

CID O
can O
lead O

renal O
failure, O
blood O
volume O
reductions, O
shock, O
and O
even O
death O
[ O

]. O
Its O
occurrence O
can O
result O
in O
delaying O
chemotherapy, O
increasing O

aggravating O
the O
psychological O

Moreover, O
many O

The O

on O
the O

which O
is O
tightly O

[ O

This O
in O

led O
us O
to O
query O
whether O
the O

To O
answer O
that O
question O
we O
conducted O
experiments O
following O
an O

on O
the O

To O
that O
end, O

or O
a O

of O
both O
in O
the O

of O
meliacine O
under O

To O
perform O
these O

meliacine, O
we O
worked O
with O
the O
compound O

Introduction O
Non-small O
cell O

cancer O
(NSCLC) O
has O
been O
a O
persistent O
cause O
of O
cancer-related O
mortality O
worldwide, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
comparatively O
low O
5-year O
survival O
rate O
[ O

NSCLC O
metastatic O
progression O
is O
correlated O
with O
the O
high O
mortality O
rates O
associated O
with O
NSCLC O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Early O
diagnosis O
of O
NSCLC O
has O
become O
a O
clinical O
essential O
in O
planning O
and O
providing O
effective O
treatment, O
which O
markedly O
improves O
the O
overall O
survival O
rate O
of O
patients O
with O
NSCLC O
[ O
3 O
]. O
However, O
the O
prognosis O
of O
patients O
suffering O
from O
NSCLC O
remains O
to O
be O
unfortunate O
[ O
4 O
]. O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
theory O
of O
cancer O
stem O

(CSCs), O
that O
cancers O
are O
maintained O
by O
subpopulations O
of O
tumor O
cells O
with O
features O
of O
stem O

and O
progenitors, O
has O
served O
as O
a O
focus O
of O
in-depth O
investigations O
in O
cancer O
research O
[ O

]. O
A O

reported O
the O
principal O
involvement O
of O
CSCs O
in O
tumor O
progression, O
recurrence, O
and O
drug O
resistance O
[ O

]. O
CSCs O
due O
to O
their O
high O
tumorigenicity O
can O
be O
observed O
in O
multiple O
human O
cancers, O
with O
great O
significance O
in O
NSCLC O
[ O

]. O
Targeting O
CSCs O
has O
been O
therapeutically O
proven O
as O
a O
curative O
strategy O
for O
NSCLC O
treatment O
[ O
8 O
], O
while O
the O
specific O
mechanisms O
still O
remain O
as O
a O
topic O
of O
research. O
Thus, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
develop O
new O
treatment O
strategies O
against O
CSCs O
as O
a O
mode O
of O
better O

When O

we O

the O

This O
may O
suggest O
that O
AirSR O

We O
also O
compared O

The O

Cathepsin O

Other O

also O
confirmed O
that O
cathepsin O

is O
essential O
for O

On O
the O

Our O

based O
on O
the O

Importantly O

we O
found O
evidence O

high O

both O

Infection O

However, O
the O

I O
in O
questing O
ticks O
in O
a O
region O
without O

but O
with O

is O
at O

suggestive O
that O

may O
play O
a O
role O
in O

Presence O

not O
sufficient O
to O
document O
the O

Culturing O
is O
the O
gold O
standard O
for O
proving O
the O

but O
this O
is O
costly, O

All O

This O

and O
most O

Iran O
14 O
, O

. O
Low O
seropositivity O

could O
be O
as O
a O
result O

HTLV-1, O
the O
first O
retrovirus O
identified O
in O
human, O
is O
also O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
hematologic O

Basically, O
HTLV-1 O
has O
a O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
blood O
disorders O
than O
the O
general O
population O
25 O
. O
So O
All O
hemophilic O
patient O
in O
this O
study O
were O
investigated O
for O
presence O
of O
HTLV-1 O
which O
was O
all O
negative. O
This O
is O
in O

with O
the O
low O

HTLV-1 O
and O
associated O
disease O
in O
Pakistan O
and O
other O
Asian O
countries O
except O

The O
prevalence O
of O
HTLV-1 O

among O
the O
general O
population O
in O
Khorasan O
province, O
a O
known O
endemic O

for O
HTLV-1 O
in O
Iran, O
varied O
from O
1.66% O
to O
7.2% O
27 O
– O

. O
According O
to O
one O
study O
conducted O
on O
108 O
hemophilic O
patients O
in O
the O
Sothern O
Khorasan O
province, O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
anti-HTLV-1 O
was O
3% O
which O
could O
cause O
significant O
health O
problems O
and O
put O
this O
population O
at O

Human O
parvovirus O

a O
false-positive O
result O
for O

30 O
. O
Although O
parvovirus O
B19 O
normally O
spread O
via O
the O
respiratory, O
it O
can O
also O
transmit O
via O
plasma-derived O

Parvovirus O
B19 O
infection O
caused O
various O
clinical O
symptoms O
among O

The O
most O
common O
parvovirus O

manifestation O
among O
children O
is O
a O
slapped O

on O
the O
face O
causing O
fifth O

and O
polyarthropathy O
among O
adults O
31 O
, O
32 O
. O
Parvovirus O
B19 O
in O
those O
patients O
with O
underlying O
hemolytic O
disorders O
like O
hemophiliacs O
may O
develop O
into O
a O
transient O

crisis O
32 O
. O
In O
addition, O
patients O
with O
parvovirus O
B19/HIV O
co-infection O
can O
also O
develop O
pure O
red O

Background O
Riemerella O
anatipestifer O
is O
a O
bacterial O
pathogen O
that O
infects O
ducks, O
geese, O
turkeys O
and O
other O
poultry. O
This O
pathogen O
can O
cause O
diseases O
characterized O
by O
serositis O
and O
sepsis, O
also O
known O
as O
duck O
infectious O
serositis, O
new O
duck O
disease O
and O
duck O
septicemia. O
The O
prevalence O

the O
disease O
can O
lead O

Rifampin O
is O
a O
semi-synthetic O
rifamycin O
that O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
effective O
and O
broad-spectrum O
antibiotics O
against O
bacterial O
pathogens. O
The O
active O
site O
of O
this O
drug O
is O
the O
β O
subunit O
of O
the O
RNA O
polymerase O
encoded O
by O
the O
rpoB O
gene. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
95% O
of O
rifampin O
resistance O
is O
related O
to O
a O
missense O
mutation O
in O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
of O
M. O
tuberculosis O
[ O
2 O
]. O
The O
earliest O
studies O
in O
E. O
coli O
found O
that O
the O
rpoB O
mutations O
were O
mostly O
concentrated O
in O
three O
clusters: O
I, O
amino O
acids O
507–533; O
II, O
amino O
acids O
563–572; O
and O
III, O
amino O
acid O
687. O
These O
regions O
are O
called O
&quot;RIF O
regions&quot; O
and O
are O
also O
known O
as O
rifampin O
resistance-determining O
regions O
(RRDRs) O
[ O

]. O
Afterwards, O
new O
sites O
outside O
the O
RRDRs O
continued O
to O
be O
reported O
[ O

]. O
With O
the O
successful O

and O
the O
development O
of O

techniques, O
analysis O
of O
the O
biosynthetic O
RNA O
polymerase O
structure O
proved O
that O
rifampin O
binds O
tightly O
to O
the O
DNA O
channel O
and O
blocks O
the O
normal O
transcription O
process. O
It O
can O
only O
block O
transcription O
initiation O
and O
did O
not O
inhibit O
the O

process O
[ O

]. O
The O

crab-like O
structure O

mainly O
of O
a O

[ O

]. O
When O
a O
specific O
mutation O
occurred O
in O
the O
rpoB O
gene, O
the O
rifampin O
molecule O
might O
be O
unable O

its O

tight O
molecular O
forces O
(such O

Moreover, O

Previous O

that O

are O
positively O
associated O

Moreover, O
antioxidant O
activity O
in O
mock-inoculated O
healthy O
control O
was O
consistently O
present O
in O
all O
the O
test O
plants. O
The O
enzyme O
activity O
in O
control O
plants O
increased O
over O
time O
after O
inoculation O
showing O
native O

Further, O
tomato O

XCV O
showed O
increased O
disease O
symptoms O
compared O
to O
those O
infiltrated O
with O
biocontrol O

B. O

CBR05. O
However, O
co-inoculation O
with O
B. O
subtilis O
showed O
increased O
plant O
growth O
and O
decreased O
disease O
severity. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
supplementation O

VitB6 O
vitamers O
like O
pyridoxine O
show O
comparatively O
low O
levels O
in O
the O
VitB6 O

and O
plant O

properties. O
Our O
results O
showed O
that O
the O
pyridoxine O
treated O
plants O
appeared O
in O
yellow O
color. O
Thus, O
the O
changed O

may O
result O
from O

12 O
. O
Moreover, O
leaves O
infiltrated O
with O
pyridoxine O
and O
XCV O
increased O
the O
severity O
of O
chlorosis O
and O

associated O

Further O
inoculation O
of O
pyridoxine O
with O
B. O
subtilis O
colonizes O
root O
in O
plants O
and O
expresses O

parameters. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
a O
possible O
role O
of O
pyridoxine O
in O
promoting O
root O
cell O
division O
and O
elongation. O
In O
our O
study, O
it O
clearly O
shows O
the O
above O
phenomena O
wherein, O
B. O
subtilis O
CBR05 O
extensively O
promote O
root O
growth O
in O

and O
altered O

in O

. O
Further, O
active O

in O
B. O

have O
been O
attributed O
to O

in O

as O
an O
elicitor O
58 O
. O
With O
this O
view, O

could O

However, O
for O
burns O
spanning O
a O
large O
area, O
split-thickness O
skin O
grafting O
may O
be O
limited O
by O
the O
availability O
of O
donor O
skin. O
To O
overcome O
this O
problem, O
split-thickness O
skin O
grafts O
are O
typically O
minced O
into O
micrografts O
to O
increase O
the O
expansion O
ratio; O
however, O
this O
can O
compromise O
wound O
healing O
quality. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
dermal O
tissue O
defects, O
fibroblasts O
secrete O
immature O
extracellular O
matrix O
(ECM) O
into O
the O
wound O
area, O
leading O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
scars. O
A O
newly O
formed O
epidermis O
cannot O
establish O
close O
contact O
with O
dermal O
tissue, O
because O
a O
new O
basement O
membrane O
cannot O
be O
established; O
as O
a O
result O
of O
this O
unstable O
epidermal-dermal O
connection, O
the O
epidermis O
readily O
blisters O
and O
falls O
off, O
leading O
to O
chronic O
ulcers O
[ O

]. O
In O
the O
1980s, O
the O
burn O
center O
at O
the O
Shanghai O
Ruijin O
Hospital O
carried O
out O
a O
clinical O
study O
of O
skin O
autografts O
combined O
with O
an O
allograft O
in O
a O
procedure O
known O
as O
intermingled O
transplantation. O
This O
technique O
involved O
wrapping O
a O
sheet O
allograft O
around O
the O
wound O
and O
punching O
holes O
about O
1 O
cm O
apart, O
with O
0.25-cm O
2 O
autograft O
pieces O
placed O
into O
the O
holes. O
A O
study O
of O
12 O
patients O
who O
underwent O
this O
procedure O
documented O
the O
so-called O
sandwich O
phenomenon, O
whereby O
the O
skin O
autograft O
migrates O
between O
the O
dermis O
and O
epidermis O
of O
the O
allograft, O
causing O
it O
to O
degenerate O
as O
a O
result O
of O
host O
rejection O
while O
leaving O
the O
autograft O
intact. O
The O
allograft O
thus O
protects O
the O
autograft O
during O
the O
healing O
process. O
Since O
allogenic O
dermis O
is O
slowly O
degraded, O

IBD O
is O
a O
worldwide O
health-care O
problem O

Development O
of O
IBD O

Among O
these O

Moreover, O
many O
pro-inflammatory O
mediators, O
such O
as O
CXCL5, O

Discussion O
The O
major O
findings O
of O
this O
study O
are O
as O
follows: O
1) O
Inflammasome-related O
proteins O
were O
upregulated O
in O
the O
peritoneum O
of O
MGO-treated O
mice; O
2) O
MGO O
induced O
parietal O
and O
visceral O
peritoneal O
fibrosis O
in O
WT O
mice, O
and O
this O
fibrosis O
was O
significantly O
reduced O
in O
mice O
deficient O
in O
NLRP3, O
ASC, O
and O
IL-1β; O
3) O
ASC O
deficiency O
reduced O
the O
expression O
of O
inflammatory O
cytokines O
and O
fibrotic O
factors, O
and O
the O
infiltration O
of O
macrophages; O
however, O
the O
myeloid O
cell-specific O
ASC O
deficiency O
failed O
to O
inhibit O
MGO-induced O
peritoneal O
fibrosis; O
4) O
MGO O
caused O
hemorrhagic O
ascites, O
fibrin O
deposition, O
and O
the O
expression O
of O
PAI-1, O
and O
all O
of O
these O
manifestations O
were O
inhibited O
by O
ASC O
deficiency; O
and O
5) O
In O
vitro O
experiments O
showed O
that O
MGO O
induced O
cell O
death O
via O
the O
generation O
of O
ROS O
in O
endothelial O
cells, O
which O
was O
inhibited O
by O
ASC O
deficiency. O
The O
present O
results O
indicate O
that O
NLRP3 O
inflammasome O
plays O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
inflammatory O
and O
fibrotic O
responses O
in O
the O
development O
of O
PD-related O
peritoneal O
fibrosis, O
and O
provide O
new O
insights O
into O
the O
mechanism O
underlying O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
PD-related O
peritoneal O
fibrosis. O

Pseudomonas O
infections O
are O
mostly O
recurrent O
which O
shows O
inability O
of O
immune O
system O
to O
completely O
irradiate O
the O
possibility O
of O
successive O
infection. O
[ O
23 O
] O
points O
out O
that O
most O
of O
the O
recurrent O
P. B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
infections O
in O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
occurred O
due O
to O
the O
relapse O
of O
prior O
infections O
which O
clearly O
suggest O
the O
inability O
of O
current O
anti-Pseudomonas O
strategies O
in O
absolute O
bacterial O
clearance. O
In O
this O
juncture O
it’s O
more O
important O
to O
concentrate O
to O
enhance O
immune O
system O
against O
such O
infections O
rather O
neutralizing O
the O
infections O
in O
each O
occasions O
which O
can O
be O
achieved O
by O
quorum O
quenching O
mediated O
in O
vivo O
attenuation O
and O
successive O
bacterial O
clearance. O
Bacterial O
attenuation O
can O
be O
attained O
by O
manipulating O
bacterial O
quorum O
sensing O
network O
by O
inhibition O
of O
AHL–Lux-R- O
and O
Lux-I-type O
interactions, O
degradation O
of O
existing O
AHLs, O
inhibition O
of O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
the O
metabolic O
synthesis O
of O
QS O
molecules, O
blockage O
of O
AHL–Lux-R-type O
binding O
sites, O
inhibition O
of O
transporters O
[ O

]. O
The O
effect O
of O
Solanum O
torvum O
root O
extracts O
upon O
bacterial O
virulence O
was O
analyzed O
by O
taking O
an O
account O
of O
pigment O
production O
and O
biofilm O
formation O
which O
is O
controlled O
by O
quorum O
sensing. O
It O
is O
been O
previously O
reported O
that O
the O
quorum O
sensing O
inhibition O
of O
Solanum O
torvum O
is O
highly O
influenced O
by O
factors O
such O
as O
bacterial O
density, O
concentration O
of O
STRE O
and O
frequency O
of O
administration O
[ O
25 O
]. O
Pseudomonas O
pigment O
pyoverdin O
enhance O
the O
iron O
gathering O
capability O
of O
pathogen O
during O
infection O
competing O
with O
iron-binding O
protein O
transferrin O
[ O
26 O
]. O
Iron O
is O
as O
vital O
factor O
for O
microbial O
virulence, O
therefore O
inhibition O
of O
pyoverdin O
leads O
to O
iron O
deficiency O
in O
pathogen O
which O
in O
turn O
inhibit O
bacterial O
virulence. O
It O
is O
evident O
that O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
aeruginosa I-PATH
respiratory O
infections O
initiated O
by O
the O
adherence O
of O
the O
pathogen O
to O
the O
oral-pharyngeal O
mucosa, O
followed O
by O
colonization O
therefore O
inability O
of O
a O
pathogen O
will O
disable O
the O
persistence O
of O
infection O
[ O
27 O
]. O

The O
previous O
study O
also O
showed O
that O
in O
A. O
thaliana, O
PDX2 O
balancing O
B6 O
vitamer O
levels O
55 O
. O
This O
possibly O
explains O
that O
de O
novo O
pathway O
predominates O
over O
the O
salvage O
pathway O
having O
mechanisms O
as O
a O
bypass. O
The O
absence O
of O
a O
salvage O
pathway O
may O
be O
due O
to O
a O
demarcated O
pathway O
as O
that O
of O
the O
non-native O
pathway. O
In O
a O
similar O
study O
by O
Torky O
56 O
, O
it O
clearly O
shows O
that O
VitB6 O
primes O
defense O
response O
and O
disease O
resistance O
in O
Capsicum O
annum O
upon O
Tobacco O
Mosaic O
Virus O
(TMV) O
infection. O
We O
also O
hypothesize O
that O
B. O
subtilis O
plays O
similar O
roles O
in O
the O
emancipation O
of O
cohesive O
response O
as O
that O
of O
TMV. O
In O
addition, O
VitB6 O
contents O
in O
XCV O
inoculated O
plants O
slightly O
decreased O
compared O
to O
those O
in O
the O
mock-inoculated O
plants. O
Moreover, O
a O
slight O
increase O
in O
the O
VitB6 O
content O
in O
mock-inoculated O
tomato O
leaves O
may O
be O
responsive O
to O
stress O
or O
wounding O
caused O
by O
mock O
infiltration. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
expression O
of O
VitB6 O
biosynthetic O
genes O
in O
tomato O
down-regulated O
after O
infection O
with O
XCV O
and O
hence O
reduced O
VitB6 O
content O
might O
be O
a O
natural O
response O
of O
plants O
to O
pathogenic O
infection O
as O
a O
part O
of O
defense O
mechanism O
18 O
. O
Previous O
studies O
showed O
thatVitB6 O
vitamers O
can O
act O
as O
antioxidant O
in O
plants O
and O
may O
act O
as O
an O
important O
modulator O
of O
redox O
status O
during O
pathogen O
defense O
response O
12 O
, O
18 O
, O
49 O
. O
When O
compared O
with O
those O
in O
the O
control O
plants, O
increased O
disease O
level O
and O
increased O
accumulation O
of O
SOD O
after O
infection O
with O
XCV O
was O
observed. O
The O
increase O
of O
SOD O
activity O
accelerated O
enzymatic O
conversion O
of O
the O
superoxide O
anion O
to O
H O
2 O
O O
2 O
and O
led O
to O
further O
accumulation O
of O
H O
2 O
O O
2 O
in O
the O
XCV O
inoculated O
plants. O
Hence, O
increased O
accumulation O
of O
H O
2 O
O O
2 O
will O
lead O
to O
production O
of O
CAT O
and O
POD. O
We O
also O
found O
that O
activity O

serious O
responsibility O
and O
a O
critical O
factor O
in O
the O
battle O
against O

Disinfection O
is O
thermal O

but O
not O
all O

Moreover, O
concerns O
have O
been O
raised O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
high O
prevalence O
of O
HAIs O
[ O
17 O
– O
19 O
]. O
Given O
the O
reality O
that O
poor O
decontamination O
of O
patient O
equipment O
can O
result O
in O
a O
range O
of O
infections O
and O
contributing O
factor O
for O
HAIs O
[ O

So O
far O
different O
studies O
were O
conducted O
in O

Here O
we O
investigate O
its O
role O
in O
innate O
immunity O
and O
tumour O
micro-environment. O
NFκB O
signalling O
plays O
a O
pivotal O
role O
in O
inflammatory O
responses, O
immune O
responses, O
cell O
growth, O
tissue O
differentiation O
and O
apoptosis O
24 O
. O
In O
resting O
cells, O
NFκB O
is O
maintained O
in O
an O
inactive, O
cytoplasmic O
state O
in O
complexes O
with O
the O
IκB O
family O
inhibitory O
proteins. O
The O
canonical O
IκBs O
comprise O
IκBα, O
IκBβ O
and O
IκBɛ O
(ref. O
25 O
). O
Although O
IκBα O
is O
known O
as O
the O
primary O
regulator O
of O
NFκB O
in O
response O
to O
inflammatory O
cytokines, O
no O
physiological O
function O
of O
IκBɛ O
outside O
the O
haematopoietic O
compartment O
has O
been O
established O
26 O
, O
27 O
. O
Two O
distinct O
degradation O
pathways O
regulate O
IκB O
levels, O
the O
well-described O
stimulus-responsive O
IKK- O
and O
βTRCP-dependent O
ubiquitin-proteasome O
system O
(UPS) O
pathway, O
and O
a O
constitutive O
degradation O
pathway O
pertaining O
to O
free O
IκB, O
not O
bound O
to O
NFκB O
(ref. O
28 O
). O
In O
the O
case O
of O
IκBα, O
this O
pathway O
is O
solely O
dependent O
on O
the O
26S O
proteasome O
29 O
. O
However, O
for O
IκBɛ, O
the O
constitutive O
degradation O
pathway O
has O
not O
been O
characterized O
to O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
have O
investigated O
the O
roles O
of O
REGγ O
in O
inflammation O
response, O
DSS-induced O
colitis O
and O
CAC O
development O
using O
mouse O
models. O
REGγ O
promotes O
colitis O
and O
CAC, O
which O
are O
associated O
with O
increased O
NFκB O
activity. O
We O
identify O
IκBɛ O
as O
a O
functionally O
relevant O
target O
of O
REGγ-dependent, O
ubiquitin-independent O
degradation O
in O
colon O
epithelia, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
suppression O
of O
the O
REGγ O
knockout O
(KO) O

in O
doubly O
deficient O
mice. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
recognize O
that O
intellectual O
disability O
is O
not O
regularly O
a O
part O
of O
the O
clinical O
picture O
of O
A-T O
although O
school O
performance O
may O
be O
suboptimal O
because O
of O
the O
many O
difficulties O
in O
reading, O
writing, O
and O
speech. O
Children O
with O
A-T O
are O
often O
very O
conscious O
of O
their O
appearance, O
and O
strive O
to O
appear O
normal O
to O
their O
peers O
and O
teachers. O
Life O
within O
the O
ataxic O
body O
can O
be O
tiring. O
The O
enhanced O
effort O
needed O
to O
maintain O
appearances O
and O
increased O
energy O
expended O
in O
abnormal O
tone O
and O
extra O
movements O
all O
contribute O
to O
physical O
and O
mental O
fatigue. O
As O
a O
consequence, O
for O
some O
a O
shortened O
school O
day O
yields O
real O
benefits. O
General O
recommendations O
for O
the O

General O
Recommendations O
for O
the O
Education O
and O
Socialization O
of O
Children O
with O
A-T O
• O
All O
children O
with O
A-T O
need O
special O
attention O
to O
the O
barriers O
they O
experience O
in O
school. O
In O
the O
United O
States, O
this O
takes O
the O
form O
of O
a O
formal O
IEP O
(Individualized O
Education O
Program). O
• O
Children O
with O
A-T O
tend O
to O
be O
excellent O
problem O
solvers. O
Their O
involvement O
in O
how O
to O
best O
perform O
tasks O
should O
be O
encouraged. O
• O
Speech-language O
pathologists O
may O
facilitate O
communication O
skills O
that O
enable O
persons O
with O
A-T O
to O
get O
their O
messages O
across O
(using O
key O
words O
vs. O
complete O
sentences) O
and O
teach O
strategies O
to O
decrease O
frustration O
associated O
with O
the O
increased O
time O
needed O
to O
respond O
to O
questions O
(e.g., O
holding O
up O
a O
hand) O
and O
inform O
others O
about O
the O
need O
to O
allow O
more O
time O
for O
responses. O
Traditional O
speech O
therapies O
that O
focus O
on O
the O
production O
of O
specific O
sounds O
and O
strengthening O
of O
the O
lip O
and O
tongue O
muscles O
﻿are O
rarely O
helpful. O
• O
Classroom O
aides O
may O
be O
appropriate, O
especially O
to O
help O
with O
scribing, O
transportation O
throughout O
the O
school, O
mealtimes O
and O
toileting. O
The O
impact O
of O
an O
aide O
on O
peer O
relationships O
should O
be O
monitored O
carefully. O
• O
Physical O
therapy O
is O
useful O
to O
maintain O
strength O
and O
general O
cardiovascular O
health. O
Horseback O
therapy O
and O
exercises O
in O
a O
swimming O
pool O
are O
often O
well-tolerated O
and O
fun O
for O
people O
with O
A-T. O
However, O
no O
amount O
of O
practice O
will O
slow O
the O
cerebellar O
degeneration O
or O
improve O
neurologic O
function. O
Exercise O
to O
the O
point O
of O
exhaustion O
should O
be O
avoided. O
• O
Hearing O
is O
normal O
throughout O
life. O

There O
is O
also O
the O
possibility O
that O
these O
hypothetical O
pathways O
are O
tangled O
and O
that O
e.g. O
Aβ O
deposits O
in O
the O
cerebrovascular O
wall O
will O
elicit O
a O
peripheral O
inflammatory O

that O
will O

such O
that O

It O

that O
human O

(Hill O
and O

We O
propose O
the O
following O
logical O
extension O
of O
Davis O
et O
al. O
After O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
inverse O
linear O
relationship O
between O
contaminant O
reads O
and O
input O
sample O
mass O
in O
an O
experiment, O
the O
quantity O
of O
microbial O
reads O
for O
a O
given O
taxa O
in O
a O
given O
sample O
can O
be O
described O
according O
to O
its O
deviation O
from O
the O
value O
predicted O
by O
the O
above-described O
linear O
regression. O
Dividing O
this O
value O
by O
the O
standard O
error O
produces O
the O
studentized O
residual, O
which O
can O
serve O
to O
identify O
outliers O
to O
the O
linear O
relationship O
while O
also O
accounting O
for O
varying O
statistical O
power O
at O
different O
points O
along O
the O
linear O
regression O
[ O
26 O
]. O
To O
demonstrate O
the O
value O
of O
this O
approach, O
we O
prepared O
sequencing O
libraries O
from O
97 O
de-identified O
serum O
samples O
from O
pregnant O
women O
collected O
with O
informed O
consent O
(UCSF O
IRB O
12-090702). O
As O
described O
above, O
RNA O
was O
extracted O
from O
100 O
microliters O
(uL) O
of O
serum, O
and O
then O
combined O
with O
25 O
pg O
ERCC O
RNA O
spike-in O
control O
set. O
Following O
library O
preparation, O
as O
described O
in O
[ O
23 O

125 O
base O
paired-end O
sequencing O
on O
an O
Illumina O
NovaSeq O

to O
a O
median O
depth O
of O
34.6 O
million O
read-pairs O
per O
sample O
(IQR O
28.3–43.6). O
Using O
the O
above-described O
workflow, O
we O
identified O
numerous O
contaminant O
microbes O
including O
both O
non-pathogenic O
laboratory O
contaminants O
such O
as O
Delftia O
acidovorans O
and O
Achromobacter O
xylosoxidans O
as O
well O
as O
potentially O
pathogenic O
organisms O
including O
Escherichia B-PATH

and O
Stenotrophomonas B-PATH
maltophilia. I-PATH
Rather O
than O
censoring O
E. O

results O
from O
the O
dataset, O
we O
use O
the O
studentized O
residual O
approach O
to O
identify O
a O
patient O
with O
more O
E. O
coli O
than O
expected O
from O
contamination O
alone O
(Fig. O
3 O
). O
Phylogenetic O
tree O
analysis O
suggests O
the O
E. O

in O
this O
sample O
to O
be O
phylogenetically O
distinct O
from O
the O
E. O
coli O
in O
our O
no-template O
controls. O
Using O
this O
methodology, O
we O
noted O
an O
additional O
patient O
sample O
as O
possessing O
a O
quantity O
of O
S. O
maltophilia O
in O
excess O
of O
what O
was O
expected O
from O

alone. O

On O

we O
have O

a O
high O
antiviral O

against O

without O
interfering O
with O
the O

We O
hypothesize O
that O
in O

administration O
of O
CDM O
could O
not O
affect O
the O
antiviral O

In O

a O

from O

at O

One O

RNA O

as O

The O

all O

(excluding O

in O

After O
microbial O
taxa O
are O
binned O
as O
either O
contaminant O
or O
true O
constituent O
of O
the O
microbiome, O
Davis O
et O

propose O
that O

taxa O
are O
censored O
from O
the O
dataset O
and O
nicely O
demonstrate O
a O
reduction O
in O

and O
other O
experimental O
improvements. O
However, O
as O
described O
by O
the O
authors, O
one O
significant O
limitation O
of O
the O
approach O
is O
that O
“decontam O
assumes O
that O
contaminants O
and O
true O
community O
members O
are O
distinct O
from O
one O
another.” O
In O
our O
view, O
such O
binary O
assignments O
are O
not O
realistic O
for O
a O
number O
of O
important O
microbes O
in O
numerous O
experimental O
situations. O
Consider O
the O
example O
of O
a O
human O
patient O
harboring O
an O
Escherichia B-PATH

bloodstream O
infection. O
As O
E. O

appears O
to O
be O
a O
ubiquitous O
laboratory O
contaminant, O
attempts O
to O
sequence O
the O
metagenome O
from O
a O
blood O
sample O
would O
produce O
a O
final O
E. O
coli O
sequencing O
count O
with O
contributions O
from O
both O
reagent O
contamination O
and O
the O
true O
microbiome. O
Disregarding O
E. O
coli O
as O
a O
component O
of O
the O
microbiome O
based O
on O
its O
identification O
as O
a O
contaminant O
would O
result O
in O
a O
false O

report, O
which O
could O
be O
disastrous O
in O
the O
field O

purposes. O
Similar O
vignettes O

and O
common O
laboratory O
contaminants, O
including O

We O
propose O
the O
following O
logical O
extension O
of O
Davis O

After O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
inverse O
linear O
relationship O
between O

an O

the O
quantity O
of O

reads O
for O
a O
given O

in O
a O

can O
be O
described O
according O
to O
its O
deviation O
from O

predicted O

the O
above-described O

Discussion O
Our O
study O
using O
a O
novel O
in O
vivo O
micro-OCT O
imaging O
technique O
suggested O
that O
the O
measurement O
of O
central O
corneal O
thickness O
and O
scar O
thickness O
were O
generally O
of O
good O
agreement O
with O
AS-OCT O
images, O
with O
at O
least O
95% O
of O
measurements O
and O
differences O
within O
the O
95% O
prediction O
intervals O
and O
95% O
LOA, O
respectively. O
We O
found O
that O
the O
images O
acquired O
were O
able O
to O
discern O
the O
five O
basic O
corneal O
layers. O
When O
imaging O
the O
irr-PTK O
injured O
eyes, O
the O
scar O
tissue O
was O
also O
detected O
prominently. O
For O
example, O
the O
mean O
central O
corneal O
(80.2 O
± O
11.28 O
μm) O
and O
scar O
thickness O
(9.9 O
± O
2.28 O
μm) O
in O
mice O
cornea O
determined O
by O
the O
micro-OCT O
showed O
good O
agreement O
with O
immunofluorescent O
histology O
measurements O
of O
(82 O
± O
5.5 O
μm) O
CCT O
and O
(9.2 O
± O
3.5 O
μm) O
scar O
obtained O
at O
Week O
2 O
follow-up. O
The O
resolution O
of O
distinction O
of O
the O
corneal O
layers O
in O
the O
processed O
micro-OCT O
acquired O
images, O
are O
comparable O
to O
the O
histology O
results, O
suggesting O
the O
potential O
for O
OCT O
to O
produce O
high O
resolution O
images O
of O
specific O
corneal O
layers O
non-invasively. O
When O
comparing O
the O
micro-OCT O
images O
with O
the O
AS-OCT O
imaging O
modality, O
the O
former O
performs O
better O
than O
AS-OCT O
in O
prominently O
displaying O
the O
scar O
distribution O
and O
intensity. O

Early O
research O
on O
airSR O
reported O
that O
this O
TCS O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
nitrate O
respiratory O
pathway O
[ O
21 O
] O
or O
in O
the O
direct O
regulation O
of O
the O
lac O
and O
opuCABCD O
operons O
[ O
23 O
]. O
Our O
microarray O
results O
indicated O
the O
down-regulation O
of O
the O
nar O
and O
nre O
operons O
in O
the O
airSR O
mutant, O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
report O
that O
airSR O
can O
positively O
regulate O
the O
nitrate O
respiratory O
pathway O
[ O
21 O
]. O
Our O
microarray O
data, O
however, O
did O
not O
show O
that O
airSR O
can O
regulate O
lac O
or O
opuC O
operons O
(data O
not O
shown). O
Another O
group O
that O
first O
named O
this O
TCS O
airSR O
described O
airSR O
as O
an O
oxygen O
sensing O
and O
redox-signaling O
regulator. O
Though O
they O
stated O
that O
airS O
contains O
a O
Fe-S-cluster O
essential O
for O
oxygen O
sensing O
and O
is O
only O
active O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
oxygen O
in O
vitro, O
they O
found O
that O
the O
airR O
mutant O
only O
affects O
gene O
expression O
under O
anaerobic O
conditions O
in O
strain O
Newman O
[ O
22 O
]. O
In O
contrast, O
our O
results O
showed O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
cell O
wall O
metabolism-related O
genes O
was O
not O
changed O
under O
anaerobic O
conditions O
(Figure O
3 O
d), O
but O
only O
under O
aerobic O
conditions O
(Figure O
3 O
a,b,c). O
After O
further O
comparison O
of O
their O
microarray O
data O
with O
ours, O
we O
found O
that, O
cap O
operon, O
pbp1, O
and O
lytM O
were O
under O
negative O
control O
of O
AirR O
in O
their O
strain O
but O
positive O
control O
in O
our O
strain; O
saeSR, O
agr, O
and O
RNAIII O
were O
under O
negative O
control O
in O
their O
strain O
but O
not O
changed O
in O
our O
strain; O
spa O
and O
hlgC O
are O
under O
positive O
control O
of O
AirR O
in O
both O
strains O
(see O
Additional O
file O
4 O
). O
The O
discrepancy O
may O
suggest O
that O
the O
regulatory O
activity O
of O
AirR O
is O
strain O
specific. O
Why O
AirSR O
acts O
differently O
in O
different O
strains O
is O
still O
not O
clear. O
Our O
speculation O
is O
that O
inactivation O
of O
sigma O
B O
in O
NCTC8325 O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
different O
activity O
of O
AirSR O
in O
NCTC8325 O
and O
Newman. O
But O
this O
speculation O
needs O
further O
study. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
this O
system O
can O
provide O
precaution O
levels O
for O
important O
blood-sucking O
taxa, O
such O
as O
mosquitoes, O
midges, O
ticks O
and O
fleas. O

At O

(Fig. O

Additionally, O
in O

a O

around O

(Fig. O

Taken O
together, O
the O

suggest O
that O

In O
order O
to O
further O
characterize O
epidermal O
nerves, O
we O
analyzed O
Nav1.8-Cre O
Rosa26-CAG-flox-stop-tdTomato O
(Nav1.8-tdTomato) O
mice O
14 O
, O
15 O
because O
epidermal O
nerves O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
mainly O
nociceptors, O
which O
express O
Nav1.8 O
sodium O
channels O
16 O
, O
17 O
. O
Indeed, O
in O
the O
whole O
mount O
ear O
skin, O
most, O
if O
not O
all, O
of O
the O
epidermal O
nerve O
fibers O
stained O

appeared O
to O
contain O
Nav1.8-tdTomato, O
while O
in O

both O

nerves O
and O
-negative O
nerves O
were O
found O
(Fig. O

; O
Supplementary O

). O
This O
indicates O
that O
virtually O
all O
neurons O
that O
innervate O
the O
epidermis O
express O
or O
have O
expressed O
Nav1.8. O

We O
do O
not O
discuss O
these O
issues O
in O
further O
detail O
here, O
as O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
they O
matter O
could O
differ O
on O
design O
(experiment/correlational), O
covariates O
and O
research O
question. O
For O
example, O
for O
many O
psychophysical O
studies, O
and O
also O
evolutionary O
psychological O
studies O
(Tybur O
et O
al. O
2014 O
), O
the O
focus O
is O
on O
within-individual O
differences. O
The O
implicit O
assumption O
is O
that O
these O
would O
not O
vary O
depending O
on O
the O
population O
studied. O
For O
such O
studies, O
it O
would O
be O
useful O
for O
authors O
to O
be O
more O
explicit O
to O
which O
degree O
these O
within-individual O
differences O
are O
expected O
to O
generalise O
to O
other O
samples. O
In O
some O
cases, O
restricted O
sampling O
in O
itself O
is O
useful O
to O
determine O
whether O
a O
behaviour O
exists O
or O
not, O
and O
as O
such O
testing O
a O
WEIRD, O
student O
and/or O
online O
population O
could O
constitute O
a O
necessary O
first O
step O
(Greenwood O
1982 O
; O
Mook O
1983 O
). O
Given O
that O
every O
sample O
is O
restricted O
in O
some O
way, O
authors O
can O
usefully O
make O
a O
statement O
pertaining O
to O
the O
constraints O
on O
generality, O
to O
explain O
the O
boundaries O
of O
the O
population O
that O
they O
believe O
their O
results O
to O
apply O
to O
(Simons O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
More O
broadly, O
the O
field O
would O
benefit O
from O
setting O
out O
the O
conditions O
under O
which O
causal O
inferences O
can O
be O
made O
(Pearl O
2009a O
, O
b O
). O
Limitations O
and O
Future O
Directions O
Our O
analysis O
did O
not O
cover O
all O
of O
the O
journals O
that O
publish O
evolutionary O
psychological O
studies. O
Instead, O
mirroring O
the O
work O
that O
has O
been O
done O
in O
other O
reviews O
of O
sample O
diversity O
(e.g. O
Arnett O
2008 O
; O
Gallander O
Wintre O
et O
al. O
2001 O
; O
Sears O
1986 O
), O
we O
focussed O
on O
key O
journals. O
Many O
papers O
on O
evolutionary O
psychology O
are O
published O
outside O
of O
those O
two O
journals. O
Similarly, O
there O
might O
be O
papers O
in O
our O
sample O
which O
have O
a O
different O
focus O
than O
evolutionary O
psychology, O
or O
which O
might O
be O
better O
classified O
as O
relating O
to O
fields O
such O
as O
comparative O
cognition, O
behavioural O
economics, O
linguistics, O
demography, O
or O
anthropology O
among O
others. O
Future O
work O
might O
compare O
one O
journal O
to O
the O
next, O
and O
compare O
across O
a O
sequence O
of O
different O
years, O
to O
determine O
the O
variance O
in O
sample O
diversity. O
Alternatively, O
one O
could O
define O
keywords O
to O
more O
clearly O
delineate O
articles O
covering O
evolutionary O
psychology. O

Generally, O
Periodontal O
disease O
is O
associated O
with O
health O
inequalities. O
People, O
who O
have O
high O
socio-economic O
statuses O
show O
a O
tendency O
to O
maintain O
good O
oral O
health O
whereas, O
those O
who O
have O
low O
socio-economic O
statuses O
show O
a O
susceptibility O
to O
periodontitis O
41 O
. O
Economic O
inequality, O
in O
addition O
to O
predicting O
general O
morbidity O
and O
mortality, O
is O
also O
strongly O
related O
to O
unhealthy O
behaviours O
and O
habits O
42 O
. O
The O
socioeconomic O
status O
and O
other O
systemic O
factors, O
including O
physical O
activity, O
could O
be O
important O
factors O
associated O
with O
periodontitis O
43 O
. O
However, O
oral O
health O
experts O
generally O
offer O
advice O
only O
on O
plaque O
control O
to O
people O
with O
periodontitis. O
Considering O
the O
results O
of O
this O
study, O
it O
may O
be O
clinically O
helpful O
to O
advice O
patients O
with O
periodontitis O
on O
the O
benefits O
of O
physical O
activity, O
especially O
regular O
walking. O
There O
is O
no O
previous O
study O
that O
explores O
the O
association O
between O
the O
regular O
walking O
and O
periodontal O
heath O
inequalities. O
The O
results O
of O
this O
study O
suggest O
that O
promoting O
regular O
walking O
can O
promote O
oral O
health. O
However, O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
because O
causal O
relationships O
between O
regular O
walking O
and O
periodontal O
health O
could O
not O
be O
discussed O
in O
this O
study. O
This O
would O
be O
useful O
for O
establishing O
a O
guideline O
for O
decreasing O
health O
inequalities O
with O
regard O
to O
periodontitis. O
The O
following O
are O
the O
limitations O
of O
this O
study. O
Firstly, O
it O
had O
a O
cross-sectional O
design O
which O
does O
not O
allow O
determining O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
causal O
relationship O
between O
regular O
walking O
and O
periodontitis. O
Further O
studies O
that O
adopt O
a O
prospective O
design O
are O
needed O
for O
the O
same. O
Longitudinal O
studies O
should O
be O
done O
to O
verify O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
direct O
role O
of O
physical O
activity O
in O
preventing O
periodontitis O
and O
to O
determine O
its O
interactions O
with O
other O
factors O
that O
are O
known O
to O
affect O
periodontitis. O
Secondly, O
this O
survey O
was O
limited O
to O
Koreans O
and O
can O
hinder O
the O
generalization O
of O
the O
results. O
Thirdly, O
since O
the O
study O
was O
based O
on O
self-reported O
health O
status O
and O
physical O
activity, O
there O
might O
have O
been O
bias. O
Finally, O
since O
periodontitis O
was O
evaluated O
using O
the O
CPI, O
periodontitis O
could O
be O
over- O
or O
underestimated O
44 O
. O
Generally, O
periodontal O
statuses O
are O
assessed O
by O
using O
clinical O
attachment O
level O
and O
pocket O
depth. O
However, O
CPI O
is O
an O
epidemiologic O
tool O
developed O
by O
WHO. O

Indeed, O
genome-wide O
p65 O
ChIP-seq O
analysis O
in O
MEFs O
stimulated O
with O
TNF/LPS O
revealed O
a O
strong O
peak O
in O
the O
promoter-proximal O
region O
of O
the O
REGγ O
gene O
( O
Supplementary O
Fig. O
2F O
). O
To O
validate O
in O
vivo O
binding O
of O
NFκB O
to O
the O
REGγ O
promoter O
in O
colon O
epithelial O
cells, O
we O
performed O
ChIP O
assays O
using O
primers O
flanking O
the O
cluster-3 O
NFκB-binding O
elements. O
Colon O
epithelial O
cells O
isolated O
from O
3-day O
DSS-treated O
mice O
showed O
significant O
recruitment O
of O
p65 O
to O
the O
REGγ O
promoter O
( O
Fig. O

), O
substantiating O
NFκB-dependent O
regulation O
of O
the O
REGγ O
gene. O
Furthermore, O
application O
of O
an O
NFκB O
inhibitor, O
SN50, O
attenuated O
TNFα-mediated O
elevation O
of O
REGγ O
( O
Fig. O
4i O
, O
p-P65 O
served O
as O
a O
control O
and O

), O
suggesting O
that O
a O
reciprocal O
regulation O
loop O
exists O
between O
NFκB O
and O
the O
proteasome-activator O
REGγ. O
REGγ O
regulates O
NFκB O
activity O
by O
degrading O
IκBɛ O
To O
elucidate O
the O
molecular O
mechanism O
by O
which O

we O
carried O

The O
global O
spread O
of O
V. O
destructor O
has O
been O
very O
rapid, O
leaving O
very O
little O
time O
to O
mitigate O
against O
the O
biological O
invasion O
by O
preventing O
introduction, O

or O
finally, O
by O
inhibiting O
further O
spread O
(Van O

Weijden O
et O

). O
Interestingly, O
A. O
mellifera O
is O
the O
only O
honey O
bee O
that O
did O
not O
naturally O
carry O
parasitic O
brood O
mites O
before O
its O
exposure O
to O
V. O
destructor O
(Eickwort O
1994 O
). O
The O
apparent O
lack O
of O
host–parasite O
co-evolution O
history O
just O
after O
hosts O
shifts O
(Woolhouse O
et O
al. O
2005 O
), O
may O
explain O
the O
much O
higher O
susceptibility O
of O
A. O
mellifera O
towards O
V. O
destructor O
and, O
as O
a O
result, O
the O
rapid O
decline O
of O
wild O
and O
feral O
European O
(-derived) O
honey O
bee O
populations O
globally O
since O
the O
spread O
of O
V. O

began O
(Rosenkranz O

al. O
2010 O
; O
Villa O
et O
al. O
2008 O
; O
Kraus O
and O
Page O
1995 O
). O
Even O
though O
it O
is O
inevitable O
that O
natural O
selection O
would O
result O
in O
A. O
mellifera O
adapting O
to O
V. O
destructor O
if O
managed O
colonies O
were O
left O
untreated, O
this O
option O
was O
not O
considered O
in O
apiculture O
as O
the O
foreseen O
loss O
of O

raised O
understandable O
concern O
over O
the O

hence O
food O
security O
(Klein O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Aizen O
et O
al. O
2008 O
). O
Therefore, O
V. O
destructor O
has O
been O
permanently O
controlled O
in O
managed O
colonies, O
preventing O
coevolution O
processes O
(as O
predicted O
by O
Oldroyd O
1999 O
), O
leading O
to O
host O
resistance O
and O

lowered O

(Neumann O

There O
is O
clear O
evidence O
that O

the O

In O
addition, O
miR-34a O
has O
been O
documented O
to O
inhibit O
cancer O
development O
in O
many O
solid O
tumors, O
including O
breast, O
skin, O
and O
prostate O
cancer O
[ O
23 O
– O
25 O
]. O
Consistent O
with O
these O
previous O
reports, O
we O
observed O
miR-34a O
to O
act O
as O
a O
tumor O
suppressor O
in O
HCC. O
The O
low O
levels O
of O
miR-34a O
in O
the O
intratumoral O
tissue O
were O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
incidence O
of O
BM O
in O
HCC O
patients. O
Moreover, O
miR-34a O
was O
found O
to O
decrease O
HCC O
cell O
proliferation, O
migration, O
and O
invasion O
in O

and O
inhibit O
BM O
in O

Previous O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
miR-34a O
is O
involved O
in O
various O
pathophysiological O
processes O
through O
the O
TGF-β O
pathway O
in O
several O
cancers O
[ O
25 O
– O
28 O
]. O
For O
instance, O
in O
HCC O
patients, O
elevated O
TGF-β O
activity O
associated O
with O
the O
persistent O
presence O
of O
hepatitis O
B O
virus O
(HBV) O
in O
the O
liver O
tissue, O
and O
was O
shown O
to O
downregulate O
miR-34a O
expression; O
this O
led O
to O
the O
enhanced O
production O
of O
the O
chemokine O
CCL22, O
which O
recruited O
regulatory O
T O
cells O
to O
facilitate O
immune O
escape. O
Therefore, O
HBV O
infection O
and O
activation O
of O
the O
TGF-β-miR-34a-CCL22 O
axis O
facilitates O
portal O
vein O
tumor O
thrombus O
development O
of O
HBV-positive O
HCC O
through O
the O
creation O
of O
an O
immune-subversive O
microenvironment O
[ O
25 O
]. O
Moreover, O
miR-34a O
mediates O
the O
resistance O
of O
oxaliplatin O
in O
colorectal O
cancer O
cells O
by O
inhibiting O
macroautophagy O
via O
the O
TGF-β/Smad4 O
pathway O
[ O
26 O
]. O
Additionally, O
miR-34a O
inhibits O
EMT O
in O
nasopharyngeal O
carcinoma O
by O
targeting O
Smad4 O
through O
the O
TGF-β/Smad O
pathway O
[ O
27 O
]. O
Consistent O
with O
this O
finding, O
our O
studies O
also O
suggest O
that O
Smad4 O
was O
a O
target O
of O
miR-34a O
in O
HCC. O

With O

However, O
due O

the O

the O

During O

that O

mapping O

However, O

why O

To O
fully O

the O

it O
is O
crucial O
to O

the O

The O
key O
to O
such O

are O
the O

The O

is O
already O
well O
understood O
and O
formulated O
in O
process-oriented O
models, O
i.e. O
canopy O
radiative O
transfer O
models O
(RTMs). O
Although O
radiative O
transfer O
is O
determined O
by O

explicitly O

RTMs O

Such O

timely O
in O
the O

(by O
producing O
a O

with O

will O
contribute O
to O
the O

generation. O
Selection O
will O
therefore O
also O
be O

Growth O
capacity: O
Selecting O
for O
the O
ability O
to O
reproduce O
(described O
above) O
indirectly O
selects O
for O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
colony O
to O
grow O
in O
spring, O
as O
only O
colonies O
that O
grow O
and O
develop O
well O
will O
initiate O
behaviour O
associated O
with O
swarming. O
This O
selection O
for O
the O
capacity O
to O
grow O
is O
also O
strong O
during O
summer: O
colonies O
made O
in O
early O
summer O
only O
have O
3 O
months O
to O
grow O
to O
a O
sufficient O
size O
to O
survive O
the O
subsequent O
winter. O
Survival: O
The O
first O
milestone O
for O
survival O
is O
the O
successful O
mating O
of O
the O
queens. O
Those O
colonies O
that O
consecutively O
produce O
a O
strong O
and O
healthy O
population O
of O
winter O
bees O
will O
have O
a O
good O
chance O
to O
survive O
the O
winter, O
and O
develop O
further O
the O
next O
spring. O
Protocol O
through O
the O
season O
Procedural O
steps O
taken O
during O
the O
year O
(Fig. O
1 O
), O
follow O
the O
natural O
development O
of O
colonies O
as O
much O
as O
possible. O
However O
they O
simultaneously O
ascertain O
that O
enough O
new O
colonies O
get O
raised O
every O
season O
to O
allow O
losses O
through O
natural O
selection O
pressure, O
and O
that O
the O
most O
important O
factor O
driving O
selection O
is O
the O
ability O
of O
colonies O
to O
survive O
V. O
destructor O
mite O
infestations. O
The O
steps O
are O
not O
prescriptive, O
but O
aim O
to O
illustrate O
the O
room O
the O
protocol O
leaves O
to O
nature O
to O
take O
the O
selective O
lead: O
elimination O
of O
non-vital O
phenotypes O
after O
mating, O
before O
and O
during O
winter O
and O
in O
spring; O
following O
natural O
development O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
during O
the O
season; O
only O
offspring O
queens O
from O
the O
colony O
in O
which O
they O
were O
raised. O
In O
the O
control O
group O
of O
colonies, O
the O
possible O
adaptation O
of O
the O
bees O
to O
the O
V. O
destructor O
mite O
is O
interrupted O
twice O
a O
year O
(in O
summer, O
2 O
weeks O
after O
making O
the O
nucleus O
colonies, O
and O
in O
winter O
when O
no O
brood O
is O
present) O
by O
treating O
the O
colonies O
with O
oxalic O
acid O
to O
kill O
the O
phoretic O
mites. O
Depending O
on O
local O
conditions O
and O
practice, O
other O
known O
efficient O
treatments O
may O
be O
used O
(reviewed O
by O
Rosenkranz O

). O

Bacteriophages O
( O
f O
) O
or O
viruses O
that O
infect O
and O
kill O
selected O
bacteria, O
could O
also O
be O
used O
as O
a O
means O
of O
selectively O
depleting O
a O
detrimental O
bacterial O
population O
One O
such O
approach O
is O
fecal O
microbiota O
transplantation O
(FMT). O
For O
example, O
fecal O
samples O
could O
be O
prepared O
from O
anti-PD-1 O
responders O
that O
show O
a O
favorable O
composition O
of O
commensal O
bacteria, O
then O
transplanted O
endoscopically O
or O
prepared O
for O
oral O
delivery O
into O
patients O
who O
are O
anti-PD-1-resistant O
and O
show O
an O
unfavorable O
composition O
of O
gut O
microbes. O
This O
approach O
would O
parallel O
the O
strategies O
being O
used O
to O
treat O
refractory O
Clostridium O
difficile O
infection O
in O
patients O
[ O
121 O
]. O
This O
approach O
delivers O
a O
complex O
community O
and O
the O
promise O
to O
transfer O
its O
beneficial O
effect. O
However, O
FMT O
is O
clouded O
by O
uncertainties O
related O
to O
the O
imprecise O
definition O
of O
a O
favorable O
microbiota, O
the O
possibility O
of O
delivering O
immune-regulatory O
bacteria, O
and O
the O
potential O
to O
transfer O
disease-promoting O
bacteria O
such O
as O
those O
contributing O
to O
obesity O
or O
even O
carcinogenesis. O
A O
subtler O
means O
of O
intervention O
may O
include O
modulating O
the O
existing O
commensal O
community O
via O
prebiotics O
or O
dietary O
changes O
to O
favor O
the O
expansion O
of O
beneficial O
bacteria O
that O
require O
specific O
substrates, O
or O
conversely, O
“starving” O
detrimental O
bacteria O
of O
their O
required O
nutrients. O
For O
example, O
short-term O
changes O
in O
human O
macronutrient O
consumption O
towards O
a O
high O
fat, O
low O
fiber O
animal-based O
diet O
increased O
bile-tolerant O
microorganisms O
(Alistipes, O
Bilophila O
and O
Bacteroides) O
and O
decreased O
levels O
of O
Firmicutes O
that O
metabolize O
dietary O
plant O
polysaccharides O
(Roseburia, O
Eubacteriumrectale O
and O
Ruminococcus O
bromii) O
[ O
122 O
]. O
Similarly, O
antibiotics O
could O
be O
considered O
a O
means O
of O
targeting O
immune-regulatory O
bacteria. O
Both O
of O
these O
approaches O
lack O
the O
precision O
to O
modulate O
very O
specific O
bacterial O
populations, O
however, O
and O
may O
have O
variable O
effects O
depending O
on O
the O
starting O
state O
of O
the O
commensal O
community. O

Neurology O

neurodegeneration O
Developmental O
and O
degenerative O
deficits O
Degenerative O
neurological O
deficits O
are O
those O
that O
manifest O
loss O
of O
previously O
established O
abilities O
over O
time. O
The O
concept O
of O
what O
comprises O
a O
“developmental O
defect” O
is O
somewhat O
more O
complex, O
and O
can O
refer O
to O
either: O
1) O
those O
deficits O
that O
disrupt O
the O
process O
of O
development O
itself, O
or O
2) O
those O
that O
are O
present O
and O
fixed O
early, O
but O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
deficit O
emerges O
as O
normal O
developmental O
processes O
unveil O
the O
already O
limited O
capacity. O
The O
neurologic O
problems O
associated O
with O
A-T O
may O
well O
represent O
a O
mixture O
of O
these O
different O
processes. O
Neurodegeneration O
at O
the O
cellular O
level O
It O
is O
not O
yet O
known O
why, O
despite O
the O
ubiquitous O
expression O
of O
ATM, O
certain O
neurons O
in O
the O
brain, O
such O
as O
cerebellar O
PCs, O
are O
so O
exquisitely O
sensitive O
to O
its O
loss O
while O
others O
appear O
not O
to O
be O
affected. O
The O
specific O
vulnerability, O
and O
relative O
health, O
of O
neurons O
despite O
the O
loss O
of O
ATM O
protein O
may O
be O
cell O
autonomous, O
due O
to O
differing O
intrinsic O
properties O
of O
the O
neurons O
themselves, O
or O
non-cell O
autonomous, O
i.e. O
related O
to O
interactions O
in O
a O
circuit O
or O
relationships O
of O
selected O
neurons O
to O
their O
supporting O
environment. O
Neurodegeneration O
at O
the O
functional O
level O
Within O
the O
brain O
as O
a O
whole, O
we O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
functional O
specificity O
of O
the O
neurodegeneration O
associated O
with O
A-T. O
For O
example: O
beyond O
the O
simple O
observation O
that O
anatomic O
changes O
are O
concentrated O
in O
the O
cerebellum, O
the O
circuits O
and O
extra-cerebellar O
brain O
regions O
involved O
in O
the O
neurodegenerative O
process O
are O
not O
known. O
The O
involvement O
of O
functions O
not O
traditionally O
ascribed O
to O
the O
cerebellum O
has O
long O
been O
observed, O
but O
whether O
this O
is O
itself O
true, O
or O
instead O
a O
function O
of O
the O
limited O
scope O
of O
information O
about O
the O
appearance O
of O
neurologic O
disease O
concentrated O
in O
the O
cerebellum, O
remains O
to O
be O
seen. O
Longitudinal O
neuroimaging O
studies, O
starting O
at O
a O
young O
age O
and O
early O
in O
the O
disease O
process O
and O
that O
track O
neuropathological O
changes O
over O
time, O
are O
also O
lacking. O
Contribution O
of O
the O
periphery O
The O
brain O
is O
supported O
and O

by O
other O
organs O
of O

Prebiotics O
are O
chemical O
substances, O
usually O
oligosaccharides, O
acting O
as O
substrates O
specifically O
for O
the O
host’s O
autochthonous O
probiotic O
bacteria, O
and O
thus O
promoting O
their O
growth. O
Prebiotics O
are O
selected O
as O
being O
non-digestible O
by O
the O
host O
and O
non-metabolizable O
by O
non-probiotic O
gut O
bacteria, O
but O
stimulating O
for O
bifidobacteria O
and O
lactobacilli O
(Gibson O
et O
al., O
2004 O
; O
Hamilton-Miller, O
2004 O
). O
A O
food O
is O
considered O
synbiotic O
when O
it O
contains O
a O
prebiotic O
and O
a O
probiotic O
ingredient. O
The O
species O
Lactobacillus, O
Bifidobacterium O
and O
Streptococcus O
are O
the O
most O
commonly O
studied O
to O
date O
because O
they O
are O
common O
and O
are O
‘natural’ O
members O
of O
the O
intestinal O
microbiome O
(Gordin O
and O
Gorbach, O
1992 O
; O
Berg, O
1998 O
). O
Moreover, O
these O
bacteria O
do O
not O
necessarily O
need O
to O
be O
alive, O
as O
products O
of O
the O
bacteria, O
such O
as O
cell O
walls O
and O
bacterial O
DNA, O
can O
modulate O
the O
profile O
of O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
and O
immune O
responses O
(Agostoni O
et O
al., O
2004 O
; O
Thibault O
et O
al., O
2004 O
). O
Their O
main O
beneficial O
effects O
are O
to O
function O
as O
the O
first O
barrier O
to O
pathogenic O
organisms O
by O
adherence, O
to O
produce O
substances O
that O
have O
antimicrobial O
effects, O
and O
to O
stimulate O
the O
immune O
processes O
in O
the O
host O
(Floch, O
2005 O
; O
Chermesh O
and O
Eliakim, O
2006 O
). O
Furthermore, O
certain O
strains O
of O
lactic O
acid O
bacteria O
(LAB) O
produce O
the O
complex O
vitamin O
cobalamin O
(or O
vitamin O
B12) O
which O
directly O
associated O
with O
AD, O
based O
on O
many O
of O
the O
studies O
which O
showed O
that O
vitamin O
B12 O
levels O
are O
lower O
in O
AD O
individuals O
compared O
with O
healthy O
subjects O
(LeBlanc O
et O
al., O
2013 O
; O
Chen O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
Additionally, O
fermented O
milks O
with O
high O
levels O
of O
B-group O
vitamins O
(such O
as O
folate O
and O
riboflavin) O
can O
be O
produced O
by O
LAB-promoted O
and O
possibly O
Bifidobacteria-promoted O
biosynthesis O
(LeBlanc O

). O

These O
results, O

To O
further O
elaborate O
on O
the O

engaged O
by O

we O
scrutinized O
the O

Selection O
of O
the O

the O
fact O
that O

But O
to O

attribute O
any O
changes O
to O
the O

activity O
only O
and O
not O
to O
the O

we O
first O
determined O
the O

ECTV O

in O
which O
the O

The O
first O
human O
pathogen O
from O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
was O
isolated O
from O
a O
patient O
with O
a O
leg O
ulcer O
in O
the O
USA O
in O
1989 O
(Farmer O
et O
al. O
1989 O
). O
This O
was O
followed O
by O
isolation O
of O
other O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
from O
human O
specimens O
in O
the O
USA O
and O
Australia O
(Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2003 O
). O
Since O
it O
was O
initially O
believed O
that O
these O
bacteria O
were O
not O
able O
to O
establish O
symbiosis O
with O
nematodes, O
the O
new O
species O
created O
for O
them O
was O
named O
P. O
asymbiotica O
to O
emphasize O
this O
feature O
(Fischer-Le O
Saux O
et O
al. O
1999 O
). O
However, O
in O
2006, O
symbionts O
of O
the O
clinical O
Photorhabdus O
strain, O
i.e. O
heterorhabditid O
nematodes, O
were O
described O
and O
classified O
as O
Heterorhabditis O
gerrardi O
(Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2004 O
; O
Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
Plichta O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
Thus, O
it O
is O
now O
accepted O
that O
human O
pathogenic O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
are O
able O
to O
form O
a O
mutualistic O
relationships O
with O
Heterorhabditis O
nematodes O
to O
infect O
insects O
efficiently, O
like O
other O
Photorhabdus O
nematode O
symbionts. O
Currently, O
two O
species: O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
comprise O
both O
clinical O
and O
entomopathogenic O
Photorhabdus O

from O
various O
locations O
(Kuwata O
et O

To O

the O
particular O
life O

of O
Photorhabdus O
human O

It O
was O
found O
that O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
bacteria O
have O
a O
relatively O
small O
genome, O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
P. O
luminesces O
(the O
closest O
relative), O
and O
display O

The O
existence O
of O
many O
supplementary O

and O
pathogenicity O

in O
the O
genome O
has O
also O
been O
shown O
(Wilkinson O
et O
al. O

, O

). O

The O
POET O
trial O
emphasises O
the O
importance O
of O
normal O
gastrointestinal O
function O
to O
facilitate O
the O
uptake O
of O
orally O
administered O
antibiotics O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
patient O
was O
commenced O
on O
IV O
vancomycin O
and O
oral O
metronidazole O
originally O
based O
on O
sensitivity O
results. O
Vancomycin O
must O
be O
administered O
via O
the O
intravenous O
route O
to O
adequately O
treat O
most O
infections, O
due O
to O
its O
poor O
oral O
bioavailability O
(&lt; O
10%) O
[ O
33 O
]. O
There O
is O
other O
evidence O
to O
support O
the O
choice O
of O
oral O
metronidazole O
monotherapy: O
oral O
metronidazole O
is O
known O
to O
have O
a O
high O
bioavailability O
(98.9%) O
[ O
34 O
], O
with O
similar O
peak O
serum O
concentrations O
when O
administered O
via O
either O
the O
oral O
or O
intravenous O
route O
[ O
35 O
]. O
Oral O
metronidazole O
tablets O
are O
therefore O
often O
the O
preferred O
mode O
of O
administration, O
if O
tolerated. O
In O
this O
case, O
metronidazole O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
minimum O
inhibitory O
concentration O
of O
0.047 O
mg/L, O
approximately O
1/85th O
of O
the O
breakpoint O
concentration O
at O
which O
an O
organism O
is O
deemed O
metronidazole-sensitive, O
as O
per O
EUCAST O
guidelines O
current O
at O
the O
time O
of O
treatment O
[ O
36 O
]. O
This O
gave O
a O
good O
degree O
of O
confidence O
that O
metronidazole O
monotherapy O
would O
provide O
sufficient O
antimicrobial O
therapy. O
Although O
clindamycin O
was O
indicated O
as O
another O
possible O
therapy O
by O
sensitivity O
testing, O
it O
is O
not O
usual O
practice O
in O
the O
UK O
to O
use O
clindamycin O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
any O
bacterial O
endocarditis O
[ O
37 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
a O
prolonged O
course O
of O
clindamycin O
was O
potentially O
harmful O
due O
to O
the O
significant O
associated O
risk O
of O
Clostridium O
difficile O
infection O
[ O
38 O
]. O
This O
supported O
the O
decision O
to O
treat O
with O
oral O
metronidazole O
alone. O
In O
contrast O
to O
our O
case, O
the O
POET O
trial O
includes O
patients O
with O
endocarditis O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
heart O
caused O
by O
Streptococcus, O
Enterococcus B-PATH
faecalis, I-PATH
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus, I-PATH
or O
coagulase-negative O
Staphylococci O
[ O
4 O
]. O

Altogether, O
our O
behavioral O
and O
histological O
data O
indicate O
that O
DM O
mice O
do O
not O
recapitulate O
the O
phenotypic O
or O
pathological O
features O
of O
POLR3-HLD O
at O
6 O
months O
of O
age, O
and O
thus O
that O
the O
heterozygous O
Polr3b O
c.308G O
&gt; O
A O
mutation O
does O
not O
lead O
to O
a O
phenotype O
in O
Polr3a O
G672E/G672E O
mice. O
Lastly, O
we O
evaluated O
the O
transcriptional O
impact O
of O
Polr3a O
and O
Polr3b O
mutations O
in O
the O
brain O
of O
DM O
mice. O
Using O
RNA-sequencing O
(RNA-seq), O
we O
found O
that O
Polr3a O
and O
Polr3b O
mRNA O
levels O
were O
comparable O
in O
WT O
and O
DM O
mice O
(Fig. O
5 O
a), O
providing O
further O
evidence O
that O
the O
two O
missense O
mutations O
do O
not O
alter O
mRNA O
stability. O
Furthermore, O
the O
three O
Pol O
III O
transcripts O
detected O
by O
this O
technique O
(Rpph1, O
Rmrp O
and O
Rn7sk) O
appeared O
unaffected O
by O
the O
Polr3a O
and O
Polr3b O
mutations O
(Fig. O
5 O
b). O
In O
addition, O
no O
protein-coding O
genes O
showed O
significant O
differences O
(adjusted O
p-value O
&lt; O
0.05 O
and O
absolute O
log2 O
fold O
change O
&gt; O
1) O
between O
the O
two O
groups, O
demonstrating O
that O
Polr3a O
G672E O
and O
Polr3b O
R103H O
missense O
mutations O
do O
not O
have O
a O
global O
impact O
on O
the O
brain O
transcriptome. O
We O
also O
measured O
the O
levels O
of O
one O
precursor O
tRNA O
and O
one O
mature O
tRNA O
by O
Northern O
Blot O
and O
found O
no O
change O
in O
their O
amounts O
in O
WT O
and O
DM O
mice O
(Fig. O
5 O
c), O
suggesting O
that O
50% O
wild-type O
Polr3b O
is O
sufficient O
to O
maintain O
Pol O
III O
function. O
Thus, O
our O
findings O
strongly O
suggest O
that O
adding O
a O
heterozygous O
mutation O
in O
a O
second O
Pol O
III O
subunit O
is O
insufficient O
to O
impair O
mouse O
neurological O
function O
or O
Pol O

Among O

the O

We O
also O

with O
DEGs O
relative O
to O
the O

DEGs O
from O

respectively, O
but O
only O
eight O
pathways O
were O
significantly O
(p O
&lt; O

enriched O
in O

We O
found O
the O
enriched O
pathways O
were O
different O
from O
the O
shared O
pathways O
mentioned O
above O
(Fig. O

The O
top O
three O

ranked O
by O
the O

of O
DEGs O
were O
“plant O

“plant O

(15 O

and O
“photosynthesis O

in O

However, O
13 O
significantly O
(p O
&lt; O

enriched O
pathways O
were O
found O
in O
YH9, O
and O
the O
top O
three O

with O
the O
most O
DEGs O
were O
“Carbon O

(24 O
DEGs)”, O
“Glycerolipid O
metabolism O
(12 O

and O
“Phagosome O
(12 O

This O
suggested O
fewer O
and O
more O
pathways O
were O
affected O
in O
the O
high O
and O
low O
cold-tolerant O
cultivar O
after O
the O
short-term O
CS, O

Moreover, O
the O
cold-sensitive O
cultivar O
appeared O
to O
be O
mostly O
changing O
expression O
of O
general O
metabolism O
genes, O
while O
the O
cold-tolerant O

was O
modifying O
general O

Since O
in O
1980–1990, O
plasma-derived O

replacement O
products O
were O
contaminated O
by O
HIV O
and O
HCV, O
we O
expect O
older O
people O
to O
be O
more O
infected O
23 O
. O
All O
HCV O
seropositive O
patients O
except O
for O
one O
(who O
was O
a O
2-year-old O
child O
with O
blood O
transfusion O
record) O
were O
over O
25 O
years O
old. O
So, O
conduct O
of O
a O
nationally-representative O
population-based O
survey O
and O
mandatory O
anti-HCV O
screening O
in O
blood O
banks O
is O
recommended O
to O
provide O
a O
better O
estimate O
of O
HCV O
prevalence. O
All O
hemophilic O
patients O
in O
this O
study O
escaped O
HIV O
infection. O
This O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
hemophilia O
population O
in O
Pakistan O
12 O
, O
24 O
and O
most O
cities O
in O
Iran O
14 O
, O
16 O
. O
Low O
seropositivity O
of O
HIV O
in O
these O
populations O
could O
be O
as O
a O
result O
of O
screening O
of O
donated O
blood O
units O
since O
1990 O
20 O
. O
HTLV-1, O
the O
first O
retrovirus O
identified O
in O
human, O
is O
also O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
hematologic O
disorders. O
Basically, O
HTLV-1 O
has O
a O
higher O
prevalence O
in O
blood O
disorders O
than O
the O
general O
population O
25 O
. O
So O
All O
hemophilic O
patient O
in O
this O
study O
were O
investigated O
for O
presence O
of O
HTLV-1 O
which O
was O
all O
negative. O
This O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
low O
prevalence O
of O
HTLV-1 O
and O
associated O
disease O
in O
Pakistan O
and O
other O
Asian O
countries O
except O
for O
Japan O
and O
Iran O
26 O
. O
The O
prevalence O
of O
HTLV-1 O
infection O
among O
the O
general O
population O
in O
Khorasan O
province, O
a O
known O
endemic O
region O
for O
HTLV-1 O
in O
Iran, O
varied O
from O
1.66% O
to O
7.2% O
27 O
– O
29 O
. O
According O
to O
one O
study O
conducted O
on O
108 O
hemophilic O
patients O
in O
the O
Sothern O
Khorasan O
province, O
the O
seroprevalence O
of O
anti-HTLV-1 O
was O
3% O
which O
could O
cause O
significant O
health O
problems O
and O
put O
this O
population O
at O
increased O
risk. O
Human O
parvovirus O
B19 O
was O
first O
discovered O
when O
a O
plasma O
sample O
from O
asymptomatic O
blood O
donors O
showed O
a O
false-positive O
result O
for O
HBV O
30 O
. O
Although O
parvovirus O
B19 O
normally O
spread O
via O
the O
respiratory, O
it O
can O
also O
transmit O
via O
plasma-derived O
products. O
Parvovirus O
B19 O
infection O
caused O
various O
clinical O
symptoms O
among O
children O
and O
adults. O

Therefore, O
P. O
jirovecii O
(previously O
P. O
carinii) O
was O
classified O
as O
a O
protozoan O
for O
a O
relatively O
long O
time. O
Based O
on O
gene O
sequence O
analysis O
technology, O
in O
2003, O
Totet O
et O
al. O
found O
that O
P. O
jirovecii O
was O
a O
fungus, O
although O
its O
morphology O
was O
more O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
a O
protozoan O
[ O
3 O
]. O
With O
developments O
in O
technology, O
in O
vitro O
culturing O
of O
P. O
jirovecii, O
which O
was O
previously O
thought O
to O
be O
difficult, O
was O
gradually O
performed. O
Thus, O
in O
2012, O
the O
complete O
genome O
sequence O
of O
P. O
jirovecii O
was O
successfully O
determined. O
Examination O
of O
the O
genome O
showed O
that O
it O
lacked O
virulence O
factors, O
and O
most O
amino O
acid O
biosynthesis O
enzymes O
showed O
a O
reduced O
guanine-cytosine O
(GC) O
content O
and O
size. O
This O
study O
suggested O
that O
P. B-PATH
jirovecii I-PATH
mainly O
infects O
the O
lungs O
and O
occurs O
only O
in O
immunodeficient O
patients O
[ O

Prior O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
AIDS O
in O
the O
1980s, O
PJP O
was O
considered O
a O
rare O
disease O
that O
was O
only O
found O
in O
patients O
with O
severe O
malnutrition, O
preterm O
infants, O
or O
patients O
with O
leukaemia O
or O
other O
haematological O
malignancies O
[ O

]. O
After O
the O
1980s O
and O
with O
the O
continuous O
increase O
in O
AIDS O
incidence, O
the O
number O
of O
PJP O
cases O
increased O
rapidly. O
In O
many O
countries, O
PJP O
is O
the O
most O
common O
opportunistic O
infection O
among O
AIDS O
patients. O
Studies O
have O
shown O
that O
in O
AIDS O
patients, O
the O
P. O
jirovecii O
colonisation O
rate O
can O
reach O
69% O
[ O
6 O

The O
current O
evidence, O
especially O
from O
genetic O
epidemiological O
studies, O
has O
shown O
that O
P. O
jirovecii O
transmission O
is O
primarily O
mediated O
and O
spread O
among O
people O
through O
the O
air. O
Individuals O
colonised O
with O
PJP O
or O
the O
P. O
jirovecii O
population O
are O
the O
infection O
source O
for O
this O
disease O
[ O
7 O

]. O
Because O
PJP O
is O
a O
severe O
pulmonary O
infectious O
disease, O
its O
accurate O
and O
timely O
diagnosis O
is O
important. O
PJP O
is O
clinically O
characterised O
by O
progressive O
dyspnoea, O

A O

either O
the O

for O
nearly O
half O
the O

Disease O

was O
a O
high O

for O
those O

These O
were O
concentrated O
in O
areas O
of O
the O
Northeast O

where O

Nutritional O

fewer O

However, O
these O

might O
be O
a O
priority O
for O
livestock O

the O

of O
probiotics O

from O
both O

Probiotics O
are O

that, O
when O

in O
adequate O
quantities, O
confer O
health O
benefits O
to O
the O

(Berg, O

Prebiotics O
are O
chemical O
substances, O
usually O
oligosaccharides, O
acting O
as O
substrates O
specifically O
for O
the O
host’s O
autochthonous O
probiotic O
bacteria, O
and O
thus O
promoting O
their O
growth. O
Prebiotics O
are O
selected O
as O
being O
non-digestible O
by O
the O

and O
non-metabolizable O
by O
non-probiotic O

(Gibson O
et O

A O
food O
is O
considered O
synbiotic O
when O
it O
contains O
a O
prebiotic O
and O
a O
probiotic O
ingredient. O
The O
species O
Lactobacillus, O
Bifidobacterium O
and O
Streptococcus O
are O
the O
most O
commonly O
studied O
to O
date O
because O
they O

members O
of O
the O
intestinal O

(Gordin O
and O
Gorbach, O

Moreover, O
these O

to O
be O
alive, O
as O

of O
the O

Background O
Dendritic O
cells O
(DCs) O
are O
professional O
antigen-presenting O
cells O
(APCs) O
found O
in O
all O
epithelial O
tissues O
and O
are O
strategically O
located O
at O
the O
sites O
of O

entry. O
A O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
established O
that O
DCs O
are O
an O
important O
link O
between O
innate O
and O
adaptive O
immunity O
because O
of O
their O
capability O
to O
innately O
detect O
pathogens O
through O
receptors O
such O
as O
Toll-like O
receptors, O
(TLRs), O
and O
also O
the O
ability O
to O
process O
and O
present O
antigens O
to O
lymphocytes O
[ O
1 O

Adaptive O

recognition O
of O

histocompatibility O
complex O
(MHC) O
class O
II O
or O
class O
I O
molecules, O
respectively, O
displayed O
on O
DCs O
surface. O
Therefore, O
processing O
of O
antigens, O
which O
occurs O
in O
phagosomes/endosomes O
or O
the O
proteasome O
is O
an O
important O
step O
before O
epitope O
association O
with O
MHC O

[ O

]. O
The O
major O
group O
of O
enzymes O
responsible O
for O
the O
degradation O
of O
exogenous O
or O
endogenous O
antigens O
is O
mostly O
the O
protease. O
Among O
them, O
the O
best O
known O
and O
well O
characterized O
are O
cysteine O
cathepsins. O
Cathepsins O
are O
essential O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
protein O
degradation, O
and O
extracellular O
matrix O
remodeling O
in O
all O
cell O
types O
and O
tissues O
[ O

]. O
They O
are O
produced O
as O
inactive O
enzymes O
(zymogenes) O
within O
the O
lysosomes. O
Cathepsins O
undergo O
activation O
by O
autocatalysis O
due O
to O
low O
pH O
or O
they O
are O
activated O
by O
other O
proteases, O
such O
as O
pepsin O
and O
cathepsin O
D O
[ O

]. O
Cysteine O
cathepsins O
are O
present O
and O
active O
in O
lysosomes, O
nucleus, O
cytoplasm O
and O
cell O
membrane O
[ O

]. O
Furthermore, O
cathepsins O
are O
also O
present O
in O
the O
extracellular O
space O
and O
secretory O
vesicles O
of O
some O
cells, O
not O
only O
as O
zymogens, O
but O
also O
as O
active O
proteases O
[ O

Such O
comparative O
sequence O
analysis O
has O
been O
widely O
used O
for O
the O
last O
years O
for O
identification O
of O
many O
new O

and O
has O
led O
to O
delineation O

several O

(Poinar O

They O
were O

a O

finally O
renamed O

(Thomas O

Cystatin O
B O
acts O
as O
inhibitor O
of O
these O
cathepsins O
and O
is O
involved O
in O
innate O
immune O
response. O
Deficiency O
of O
Cst O
B O
leads O
to O
down-regulation O
of O
IFN O
regulated O
genes O
in O
murine O
microglia O
[ O
21 O
, O
35 O
]. O
Interestingly, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
cystatin O
B O
interacted O
with O
several O
proteins O
in O
HIV-1-infected O
macrophages O
[ O
36 O
]. O
Because O
we O
observed O
down-regulation O
of O
cathepsins O
B O
and O
L, O
and O
cystatin O
B O
in O
ECTV-infected O
cDCs O
at O
gene O
and O
protein O
levels, O
we O
investigated O
whether O
this O
change O
was O
a O
genuine O
reduction O
in O
protein O
translation O
due O
to O
lower O
mRNA O
levels O
or O
whether O
the O
change O
could O
have O
resulted O
from O
cytoplasmic O
relocation O
of O
proteins O
following O
infection. O
We O
visualized O
protein O
distribution O
patterns O
within O
infected O
cells. O
Immunofluorescence O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
the O
distribution O
of O
cathepsin O
B O
was O
significantly O
reduced O
at O
each O
time O
point O
of O
infection O
and O
no O
co-localization O
between O
cathepsin O
B O
and O
viral O
factories O
in O
JAWS O
II O
and O
GM-BM O
cells O
was O
observed O
(Fig. O
5 O
a O
and O
b). O
Surprisingly, O
cathepsin O
L O
was O
able O
to O
co-localize O
with O
viral O
factories O
at O
4, O
12 O
and O
24 O
hpi O
both O
in O
JAWS O
II O
and O
GM-BM O
cells O
(Fig. O
5 O
c O
and O
d), O
suggesting O
that O
although O
both O
are O
cysteine O
cathepsins, O
they O
may O
function O
differently. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
cystatin O
B, O
immunofluorescence O
staining O
showed O
that O
cystatin O
B O
partially O
co-localized O
with O
viral O
replication O
centers O
especially O
in O
GM-BM O
cells O
at O
4 O
and O
12 O
hpi O
(Fig. O
5 O
a O
and O
b). O
The O
data O
suggests O
that O
there O
is O
no O
relocation O
of O
cathepsin O
and O
cystatins O
e.g., O
to O
the O
nucleus, O
protein O
reduction O
is O
highly O
likely O
to O
result O
from O
reduced O
mRNA. O
The O
co-localization O
of O
cathepsin O
L O
and O
partial O
co-localization O
of O
cystatin O
B O
with O
viral O
factories O
may O
suggest O
that O
some O
ECTV O
particles O
transit O
through O
intracellular O
vesicles O
containing O
cathepsins O
and O
cystatins. O

Some O
of O
these O
proteins O
remain O
in O
the O
cell O
envelope, O
where O
they O
are O
important O
for O
modifying O
the O
cell O
permeability O
and O
uptake O
of O
hydrophobic O
carbon O
sources O
(Abdallah O
et O
al. O
2009 O
; O
Ates O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
In O
addition, O
Mtb O
ESX-5 O
system O
mediates O
the O
reduction O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokine O
secretion O
by O
macrophages O
and O
induces O
a O
caspase-independent O
cell O
death O
in O
macrophages O
after O
phagosomal O
escape O
of O
the O

enabling O
the O
bacteria O
to O
infect O
neighboring O
cells O
(Abdallah O
et O
al. O
2008 O
, O
2011 O
). O
Also, O
ESX-5 O
components O
are O
upregulated O
during O
phosphate-limiting O
conditions O
(Elliot O
and O
Tischler O
2016 O
). O
Even O
though O
the O
specific O
role O
of O
cyp143a1 O
remains O
unclear, O
its O
association O
with O
the O
esx-5 O
locus O
may O
reflect O
a O
pivotal O
contribution O
to O
components O
of O
the O
transport O
channel. O
Furthermore, O
ESX-5 O
transposon O
insertion O
mutants O
in O
the O
gene O
encoding O
CYP143A1 O
Mtb O
were O
attenuated O
both O
in O

and O
in O
the O
immunodeficient O
mouse O
infection O
model O
(Bottai O
et O
al. O
2012 O
; O
Sayes O
et O

2012 O
). O
The O
same O
holds O
true O
for O
MMAR_2666 O
(cyp143a1 O
homolog O
in O
M. O

during O
infection O
in O
RAW, O
THP-1, O
or O
CLC O
cell O
lines O
(Weerdenburg O
et O

2015 O
). O
These O
results O
confirm O
that O
CYP143A1 O
might O
have O
a O
conserved O
pathogenic O
role O
and O
therefore O
highlights O
its O
potential O
use O
as O
a O
drug O

The O
relatively O
low O
number O
of O

partners O
compared O
to O
the O
number O
of O
CYP O
genes O
in O
Mtb O
implies O
that O
these O
redox O
proteins O
are O
promiscuous O
in O

electron O
transfer. O
However, O
some O
CYPs O
may O
have O
evolved O

that O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
ability O
of O
mutants O
to O
resist O
hydrogen O
peroxide O
and O
NO O
was O
decreased O
in O
an O
in O

sensitivity O
experiment. O
This O
result O
also O
supported O
the O
results O
of O
colonization O
experiments O
in O
vivo. O
Both O
active O
oxygen O
and O
reactive O
nitrogen O
in O
vivo O
were O
the O
environmental O
pressures O
that O
the O
bacteria O
would O
encounter. O
The O
defense O
against O
oxidative O
stress O
was O
crucial O
for O
the O
survival O
of O
bacteria O
in O
the O
body O
[ O

]. O
So O
far, O
the O
rpoB O
mutant O
has O
not O
been O
characterized O
in O
detail O
and O
may O
lack O
sufficient O
attention. O
The O
lacking O
dose O
of O
rifampin O
in O
use O
and O
the O
residual O
drug O
in O
the O
environment O
may O
provide O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
with O
the O
stress O
condition O
required O
for O
spontaneous O
mutation. O
The O
fitness O
cost O
of O
rpoB O
mutation O
may O
be O
due O
to O
changes O
in O
gene O
transcription O
level, O
and O
transcriptome O
analysis O
of O
mutant O
strains O
will O
be O
of O
great O
value. O
Therefore, O
further O
investigation O
and O
evaluation O
are O
necessary. O
Conclusions O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
R. O
anatipestifer O
rifampin O
resistance O
is O
mainly O
derived O
from O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
mutation, O
whose O
types O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
strain O
background O
and O
environment O
stress. O
The O
spontaneous O
mutation O
of O
rpoB O
gene O
is O
concentrated O
in O
the O
mutation O
type O
with O
low O
fitness O
cost. O
And O
different O
rpoB O
mutations O
confer O
different O
fitness O
costs. O
Our O
study O
provides, O
to O
our O
knowledge, O
the O
first O
estimates O
of O
the O
fitness O
cost O
associated O
with O
the O
R. O
anatipestifer O
rifampin O

in O

The O
prospect O
of O
delaying O
or O
preventing O
the O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
is O
feasible O
and O
within O
our O
grasp. O
However, O
this O
mission O
must O
surmount O
a O
number O
of O
barriers, O
which O
contain O
inadequate O
funding O
of O
research, O
high O
cost O
of O
clinical O
studies, O
lack O
of O
suitable O
infrastructure, O
better O
models, O
antiquated O
administrative O
structure O
of O
discovery O
programs, O
and O
arcane O
decision-making O
systems O
for O
selecting O
and O
funding O
innovative O
ideas. O
Recently, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
know O
for O
certain O
that O
someone O
has O
AD O
is O
to O
examine O
an O
autopsy O
of O
their O
brains O
tissue O
after O
death. O
The O
crucial O
challenge O
for O
the O
AD O
researches O
is O
how O
to O
understand O
the O
process O
of O
neurodegenerative O
disorders O
throughout O
the O
patient’s O
lifetime. O
Additionally, O
the O
lack O
of O
efficient O
cultivation O
techniques O
stems O
from O
many O
factors O
that O
largely O
remain O
unknown O
(Lopez O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
Hence, O
molecular O
ecology O
and O
metagenomics O
have O
significantly O
increased O
our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
genetic O
diversity O
and O
have O
led O
to O
interesting O
hypotheses O
(Hugenholtz O
and O
Tyson, O
2008 O
). O
The O
advanced O
techniques O
have O
also O
revealed O
how O
far O
we O
are O
from O
measuring O
the O
full O
extent O
of O
genetic O
diversity O
encoded O
by O
microbial O
life O
(Hugenholtz O
and O

2008 O
; O
Pignatelli O
et O

Summary O
Microbial O
colonization O
of O
the O

plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
the O
postnatal O
development O
and O
maturation O
of O
the O
immune, O
endocrine O
and O
even O
neural O
systems, O
these O
processes O
are O
key O
factors O
underpinning O
CNS O

Indeed, O
understanding O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
is O
important O
in O
relation O
to O
inflammation O
and O
metabolic O
diseases O
that O
have O
a O
direct O
relation O
to O
the O
AD O
pathogenesis. O
Moreover, O
comparative O
analysis O
of O
gut O
microbiota O
may O
enable O
further O
novel O
vision O
into O
the O
complex O
biology O
of O
AD, O
which O
is O
very O
important O
in O
order O
to O
take O
preventive O

such O
as O
early O

We O

this O

was O
true O
for O
the O

for O

To O
evaluate O
the O

changes, O
we O
incorporated O
the O
phosphorylation O
state O
of O
ribosomal O
protein O
S6 O
(pS6) O
into O
Met-Flow. O
The O
S6 O
protein O
is O

is O
phosphorylated O
upon O
TCR O
engagement, O
driving O
translation O
of O
glycolytic O
proteins O
in O
T O
cells O
2 O
, O

. O
Met-Flow O
analysis O
showed O
increased O
levels O
of O
CD69, O
CD25, O
and O
GLUT1 O
in O
pS6-positive O
cells O
compared O
with O
pS6-negative O
cells, O
whereas O
other O
metabolic O
proteins O
showed O
heterogeneous O
expression O
(Fig. O
5e O
). O
This O
phosphorylation O
was O
specifically O
induced O
by O
CD3/28 O
stimulation, O
as O
untreated O
or O
2-FDG O
treated O
T O
cells O
are O
pS6 O
negative. O
However, O
2-FDG O
dampened O
this O
activation-induced O
increase O
in O
the O
bulk O
population O
(Fig. O

). O

This O
study O
corroborates O
the O
preferential O
association O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
ecotype O
I O
to O
red O
deer O
and O
ecotype O
II O
to O
roe O
deer, O
consistent O
with O
previous O
studies O
[ O
15 O
]. O
Importantly O
and O
surprisingly, O
we O
found O
evidence O
of O
high O
infection O
prevalence O
of O
both O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
in O
moose. O
Infection O
prevalence O
is O
not O
direct O
evidence O
of O
transmission O
competence. O
However, O
the O
high O
infection O
rates O
in O
moose O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
ecotype O
I O
in O
questing O
ticks O
in O
a O
region O
without O
red O
deer, O
but O
with O
moose O
present, O
is O
at O
least O
suggestive O
that O
moose O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
transmission O
of O
both O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum. O
Presence O
of O
bacterial O
DNA O
in O
tissue O
samples O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
document O
the O
viability O
or O
infectivity O
of O
a O
pathogen O
in O
the O
host. O
Culturing O
is O
the O
gold O
standard O
for O
proving O
the O
viability O
or O
infectiousness O
of O
microorganisms, O
but O
this O
is O
costly, O
time-consuming, O
difficult O
for O
many O
tick-borne O
pathogens, O
and O
generally O
suffers O
from O
a O
low O
sensitivity O
[ O
36 O
]. O
PCR-array O
also O
has O
its O
limits, O
and O
there O
might O
be O
presence O
of O
bacteria O
below O
detectable O
concentrations O
[ O
37 O
]. O
Also, O
vector O
competence O
requires O
larval O
(or O
nymphal) O
ticks O
to O
be O
infected O
from O
their O
blood O
meal O
and O
passing O
viable O
pathogens O
at O
the O
nymphal O
(or O
adult O
female) O
stage O
to O
a O
novel O
host. O
However, O
since O
many O
studies O
are O
indicating O
I. O
ricinus O
as O
the O
vector O
and O
cervids O
as O
potential O
hosts O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
DNA-based O
detection O
provides O
useful O
information O
when O
aiming O
to O
elucidate O
the O
different O
enzootic O
cycles. O
There O
are, O
however, O
several O
other O
difficult O
issues O
in O
determining O
circulation O
and O
enzootic O
cycles O
of O
pathogens. O
Adaptations O
of O
bacteria O
to O
specific O
host O
groups O
require O
mutations O
in O
coding O
genes, O
but O
many O
mutations O
are O
neutral O
and O
single O
mutation O
sequence O
dissimilarity O
is O
not O
sufficient O
in O
the O
meaning O
of O
ecotype O
characterization O
or O
bacterial O
speciation O
[ O
38 O
]. O

In O
proteins O
with O
a O
single O
TM O
domain O
this O
means O
that O
they O
would O
have O
a O
large O
cytoplasmic O
domain O
containing O
several O
highly O
conserved O
regions O
including O
kinase O
sites O
while O
in O
proteins O
with O
two O
TM O
domains O
there O
is O
a O
smaller O
cytoplasmic O
domain O
and O
two O
‘extracellular’ O
facing O
domains O
(Additional O
file O
19 O
: O
Figure O
S3D). O
In O
terms O
of O
ER-binding O
proteins O
the O
‘extracellular’ O
domain O
is O
equivalent O
to O
the O
lumen O
compartment O
while O
for O
plasmalemma O
proteins O
it O
really O
is O
extracellular. O
Therefore O
the O
Ca O
2+ O
binding O
and O
heme-coordinating O
regions O
of O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
are O
probably O
located O
either O
in O
the O
ER O
lumen O
or O
outside O
the O
cell O
membrane O
while O
there O
are O
several O
kinase O
sites O
on O
the O
cytoplasmic O
portions O
of O
these O
proteins. O
These O
characteristics O
are O
consistent O
with O
roles O
for O
CLO/PXGs O
in O
processes O
such O
as O

and O
the O
recognition O
of O
external O
agents, O
e.g. O
as O

CLO/PXG O

are O
present O
in O
about O
30% O

the O
question: O
what O
is O
the O
function(s) O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
in O
Fungi O
and O
what O
is O
the O
difference O

those O
that O

We O
describe O
above O
new O
evidence O
that O
we O
have O
presented O
for O
some O
specific O
functions O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
that O
are O
related O
to O
processes O
involving O
oxylipin O

and O
aflatoxicogenicity. O
However, O
it O
is O
also O
important O
to O
look O
more O
broadly O
at O
other O
possible O
functions O
of O
these O
genes, O
especially O
in O
the O
light O
of O
their O
apparent O

in O

many O

groups. O
In O
this O

we O
were O
unable O
to O
discern O
any O
systematic O
differences O
between O
those O

Microbiota-oriented O
interventions O

While O
stable O
on O
a O
global O
scale, O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
regularly O
undergoes O
small O
fluctuations O
and O
is O
amenable O
to O
strategies O
which O
could O
shape O
the O
commensal O

to O
either O
help O
improve O
patient O
response O
rates O
to O
immunotherapy O
or O
prevent O
treatment-related O
toxicity O
such O
as O
colitis. O
These O
approaches O
range O
from O
complex O
community O
transfers O
in O
the O
form O
of O
( O
a O
) O
fecal O
microbiota O
transplantation O
(FMT) O
which O
may O

many O

on O
the O

to O

of O
( O

a O

with O

( O

Bacteriophages O
( O

or O
viruses O
that O
infect O

selected O
bacteria, O
could O
also O
be O
used O
as O
a O
means O
of O
selectively O
depleting O
a O
detrimental O
bacterial O
population O
One O
such O
approach O
is O
fecal O
microbiota O
transplantation O
(FMT). O
For O
example, O
fecal O
samples O
could O
be O
prepared O
from O
anti-PD-1 O
responders O
that O
show O
a O
favorable O
composition O
of O
commensal O
bacteria, O
then O
transplanted O
endoscopically O
or O
prepared O
for O
oral O
delivery O
into O
patients O
who O
are O
anti-PD-1-resistant O
and O
show O
an O
unfavorable O
composition O
of O
gut O
microbes. O
This O
approach O
would O
parallel O
the O
strategies O
being O
used O
to O
treat O
refractory O
Clostridium O
difficile O
infection O
in O
patients O
[ O
121 O
]. O
This O
approach O
delivers O
a O
complex O
community O
and O
the O
promise O
to O
transfer O
its O
beneficial O
effect. O

Subsequently, O
we O
focused O
our O
investigation O
on O
RssR O
due O
to O
its O
more O
distinct O
effect O
on O
S. O
Typhimurium O
growth O
with O

As O

deletion O

as O

expression O
of O
RssR O
results O
in O
growth O
phenotypes O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium O
in O
MM O
with O
MI. O
This O
finding O
led O
to O
the O
assumption O
that O
RssR O
regulates O
an O
mRNA O
encoded O
on O
GEI4417/4436. O
To O
test O
this O
hypothesis, O
the O
luciferase O

luxCDABE O
was O
chromosomally O
fused O
to O
the O
end O
of O
each O

iol O
operon O
or O

gene O
essential O
for O
MI O
degradation O
as O
determined O
previously O
17 O
. O
The O
resulting O
strains O
(Table O

were O
then O
equipped O
with O

pZE-rssR O
to O
allow O

Here O
a O

Due O
to O
these O

we O

from O
the O

€229 O
per O
patient O
between O
January O
2007 O

December O
2010 O
[ O

Each O

had O
an O
average O
of O
4.5 O

The O
cost O
for O
the O
Italian O
NHS O
was O
higher O
than O
the O

for O
the O

However, O
the O
women O
included O
in O
the O
Italian O

the O

of O
cystitis, O
which O

In O

in O

between O
2005 O

from O

The O
mean O

[ O

The O

differences O
between O
this O

and O
the O

may O
have O
been O
related O
to O
the O
systematic O
one-month O
follow-up O
(with O
no O
differences O
between O

used O
in O
the O

(approximately O
30 O

that O
of O

In O
the O
United O

in O
2010, O
the O
annual O
direct O

indirect O
UTI O

was O
estimated O
at O
$2.3 O

Considering O
that O
the O
American O

was O
approximately O
five O

in O
2012, O
the O
American O

was O
six O
times O
greater O
than O
the O

This O
difference O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
the O

which O
are O
three O
to O
ten O
times O
more O

against O

[ O

Furthermore, O
in O
the O

the O

However, O

However, O

In O

by O
both O
in O

We O
selected O
R. O
arrhizus O
cyt O
c O
as O
a O
candidate O
for O
this O
study O
mainly O
for O
two O
reasons. O
First, O
this O
fungal O
cyt O
c O
is O
distantly O
related O
to O
mammalian O
cyt O
c O
and O
its O
biochemical O
properties O
are O
largely O
unknown. O
Secondly, O
R. O
arrhizus O
is O
a O
pathogenic O
fungus O
and O
any O
information O
gained O
on O
the O
pro-apoptotic O
activity O
of O
cyt O
c O
may O
also O
contribute O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
better O
therapeutic O
targets. O
We O
found O
that O
cyt O
c O
of O

arrhizus O
has O
similar O
biochemical O
properties O
to O
mammalian O
cyt O

A O
19-fold O

using O
a O

which O
had O
an O

Since O
this O

the O
first O
report O
on O

c, O
we O
compared O
our O

We O
obtained O

Our O

only O
marginally O
lower O
if O
we O

after O
the O

At O

a O

Our O

Several O

Furthermore, O
the O

require O
a O
greater O

thus O
reducing O
the O

In O
addition, O
technological O
limitations O

The O

We O

that O
of O
the O

KIM B-PATH
(branches O

( O

cases, O
in O
an O

We O
found O
that O
both O
Angola O

Pestoides O
A, O
ancestral O
branched O
strains O
that O
carry O
pPCP1 O
(although O
with O
the O

are O
able O
to O
replicate O

the O
bacterial O

of O
the O
modern O

strains O
CO92 O
and O
KIM O
( O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
Pestoides O
E O
and O
F O
strains O
are O
unable O
to O
rapidly O
proliferate O
in O
the O
pulmonary O
compartment O
( O

), O
suggesting O
the O
absence O
of O
one O
or O
more O
virulence O
determinants O
required O
to O
cause O
primary O
pneumonic O
plague. O
A O
comparison O
of O
these O

showed O
that O
a O
major O
distinguishing O
feature O
between O
Angola O
and O
Pestoides O
A O
versus O
Pestoides O
E O
and O
F O
is O
the O
presence O
of O
pPCP1, O
the O
plasmid O
encoding O
the O
virulence O
factor O
Pla; O
neither O
Pestoides O
E O
nor O
Pestoides O
F O
naturally O
carry O
pPCP1 O
( O
Supplementary O

) O
29 O
. O
Consistent O
with O
this, O
we O
found O
that O
all O
of O
the O
pPCP1 O
+ O
strains O
are O
able O
to O
synthesize O
Pla O
to O
similar O
levels, O
however O
both O
Angola O
and O
Pestoides O
A O
do O
not O
autoprocess O
Pla O
due O
to O
the O
I259 O
variant O
of O
the O
protease O
carried O
by O
these O

28 O
( O

Thus, O
these O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
gain O
of O
pPCP1 O
early O
during O
the O
evolution O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
was O
necessary O
for O

In O

As O

As O
a O
result, O
mycobacteria O

capable O

evade O
the O

Pks9 O

the O

which O
are O
minor O
components O
of O
sulfolipids O
and O
acyltrehaloses O
(Dubey O

Pks11 O
could O
be O

in O
the O

malonyl-CoA O
(Saxena O

but O
the O

Hence, O
CYP139A1 O

the O

the O

Using O
a O

we O
recently O
showed O
that O

We O
also O
showed O
that O

In O

leading O
to O
an O

finding O
about O
the O

Due O
to O
the O

we O
were O

In O

they O

both O

that O

that O

Nonetheless, O
the O

that O

that O

appear O
or O

Different O
forms O

have O
been O
described O
in O
the O
literature, O
with O
those O
more O
severe O
variably O
categorized O
as O
“classic”, O
“typical”, O
“early O

or O
“childhood O

have O
been O
referred O

We O
utilize O
the O

and O

to O
distinguish O
the O
two O

broadly O

People O

Ataxia O
and O
other O
neurological O
manifestations O
In O
the O
classic O
presentation O
of O
the O
disease, O
ataxia O
first O
appears O
during O
the O
toddler O
stage O
when O
children O
begin O
to O
sit O
and O
walk. O
Children O
with O
A-T O
often O
start O
walking O
at O
a O
normal O
age O
but O
then O
fail O
to O
improve O
much O
from O
their O
initial O
wobbly O
gait O
(reviewed O
in O
[ O
4 O
, O
10 O
] O
and O
[ O
11 O
]). O
Often O
they O
have O
problems O
standing O
or O
sitting O
still O
and O
tend O
to O
sway O
slowly O
from O
side O
to O
side O
or O
backwards. O
Because O
most O
children O
with O
classic O
A-T O
have O
stable O
neurologic O
symptoms O
for O
the O
first O
4–5 O
years O
of O
life, O
they O
initially O
may O
be O
labeled O
as O
having O
“ataxic O
cerebral O
palsy” O
[ O
10 O
], O
but O
the O
existence O
of O
such O
a O
syndrome O
is O
nosologically O
unclear. O
In O
primary O
school O
years, O
walking O
becomes O
more O
difficult, O
and O
children O
will O
use O
doorways O
and O
walls O
for O
support. O
Children O
with O
A-T O
often O
run O
or O
walk O
quickly, O
and O
do O
so O
with O
a O
curiously O
narrow O
stance, O
in O
deference O
to O
walking O
more O
carefully O
and O
slowly. O

It O

By O
utilizing O
the O

lineages, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
specific O

contributed O
directly O
to O
the O
adaptation O

to O
the O

environment, O
and O
no O
additional O
genetic O
changes O
were O
necessary O

On O
the O

hand, O
our O
results O
indicate O
that O
the O

of O
the O

enhanced O

that O

its O

efficiently O

To O
identify O
wheat O
genes O

we O
screened O
AMT O
genes O
that O
were O

expressed O
during O
wheat-Pst O
interaction O
using O
the O
transcriptome O
database O
[ O

A O
wheat O
gene O
encoding O
an O
AMT2-type O
ammonium O
transporter O
was O
found O
to O
be O
upregulated O
upon O
Pst O

This O
gene O
was O
designated O
as O
TaAMT2;3a O
according O
to O
its O
homologous O
gene O
in O
Arabidopsis O
and O
a O
published O
reference O
[ O

The O
induction O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O
by O
Pst O
infection O
was O
further O
confirmed O
by O
quantitative O
RT-PCR. O
Analysis O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O
expression O
revealed O
that O
during O
a O
compatible O
interaction, O
the O
transcription O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O
was O
induced O
as O
early O
as O
6 O
hpi O
and O
reached O
the O
highest O
level O
at O
18 O
hpi, O
which O
was O
7.3-fold O
higher O
than O
that O
in O
the O
control O
plants O
(Fig. O

The O
mRNA O
levels O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O
in O
different O
wheat O
tissues O
(roots, O
stems, O
leaves) O
were O
examined. O
The O
results O
indicated O
that O
TaAMT2;3a O
was O
detectable O
in O
all O
tested O
wheat O
tissues, O
and O
the O
transcription O
levels O
of O
TaAMT2;3a O
in O
leaves O
were O
significantly O
higher O
than O
those O
in O
roots O
and O
stems O
(Fig. O

These O
results O
suggested O
that O
TaAMT2;3a O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
transporting O
ammonium O
in O
the O
leaves O
and O
play O
an O
important O
role O

It O
is O
therefore O
evident O
that O
apiculture O
is O
of O
significant O
economic O
and O
societal O
value. O
As O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
globalization O
of O
apiculture, O
the O
number O
of O
novel O
pathogens O
affecting O
A. O
mellifera O
has O
increased O
through O
host O
shifts O
from O
closely O
related O
species. O
This O
was O
the O
case O
for O
the O
ecto-parasitic O
mite O
Varroa O
destructor O
(Anderson O
and O
Trueman O
2000 O
), O
which O
has O
shifted O
hosts O
from O
the O
Eastern O
honey O
bee O
(Apis O
cerana) O
to O
A. O
mellifera. O
This O
mite O
has O
now O
an O
almost O
ubiquitous O
distribution O
(Ellis O
and O
Munn O
2005 O
) O
and O
is O
the O
primary O
biological O
cause O
of O
A. O
mellifera O
colony O
mortality O
worldwide O
(Neumann O
and O
Carreck O
2010 O
; O
Rosenkranz O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
V. O
destructor O
is O
a O
very O
efficient O
vector O
of O
several O
honey O
bee O
viruses, O
generating O
a O
disease O
epidemic O
within O
the O
colony, O
which O
dwindles O
until O
it O
dies O
within O
2–3 O
years O
(Neumann O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
The O
global O
spread O
of O
V. O
destructor O
has O
been O
very O
rapid, O
leaving O
very O
little O
time O
to O
mitigate O
against O
the O
biological O
invasion O
by O
preventing O
introduction, O
eradicating O
introduced O
mites, O
or O
finally, O
by O
inhibiting O
further O
spread O
(Van O
der O
Weijden O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
Interestingly, O
A. O
mellifera O
is O
the O
only O
honey O
bee O
that O
did O
not O
naturally O
carry O
parasitic O
brood O
mites O
before O
its O
exposure O
to O
V. O
destructor O
(Eickwort O
1994 O
). O
The O
apparent O
lack O
of O
host–parasite O
co-evolution O
history O
just O
after O
hosts O
shifts O
(Woolhouse O
et O
al. O
2005 O
), O
may O
explain O
the O
much O
higher O
susceptibility O
of O
A. O
mellifera O
towards O
V. O
destructor O
and, O
as O
a O
result, O
the O
rapid O
decline O
of O
wild O
and O
feral O
European O
(-derived) O
honey O
bee O
populations O
globally O
since O
the O
spread O
of O
V. O
destructor O
began O
(Rosenkranz O

Metabolite O
profiles O
are O
distinctive O
for O
each O
interaction O
zone O
Regarding O
the O
metabolite O
analysis, O
we O
should O
mention O
that O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
previously O
discussed O
transcriptome O
analysis, O
most O
metabolites O
cannot O
be O
attributed O
to O
one O
of O
the O
two O
interaction O
partners O
definitively. O
Combining O
the O
knowledge O
gained O
from O
the O
transcriptomes O
and O
comparison O
with O
the O
blank O
and O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
level O
of O
interaction, O
these O
profiles O
can O
be O
interpreted. O
One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
compounds O
identified O
in O
the O
metabolite O
analysis O
is O
the O
non-metabolizable O
sucrose-analog O
turanose. O
It O
is O
involved O
in O
signal O
transduction O
and O
priming O
of O
defence O
in O
Lycopersicon O
peruvianum O
(tomato), O
Zea O
mays O
(maize) O
and O
Oryza O
sativa O
(rice) O
69 O
, O
70 O
. O
Several O
studies O
report O
on O
a O
reduction O
of O
the O
turanose O
content O
after O
plant O
infection O
with O
R. O
solani, O
most O
likely O
because O
fungi O
unlike O
plants O
are O
capable O
to O
metabolize O
turanose O
70 O
, O
71 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
co-inoculation O
with O
Bacillus O
amyloliquefaciens O
resulted O
in O
a O
turanose O
concentration O
comparable O
to O
the O
control O
samples O
and O
it O
was O
suggested O
that O
this O
adjustment O
is O
mechanistic O
in O
plant O
priming. O
We O
propose O
a O
slightly O
modified O
hypothesis O
where O
not O
the O
absolute O
concentration O
but O
the O
change O
in O
concentration O
of O
turanose O
is O
able O
to O
prime O
plant O
defence. O
Further O
compounds O
with O
reduced O
concentrations O
during O
interaction O
comprised O
the O
amino O
acids O
tyrosine, O
methionine, O
threonine, O
isoleucine, O
valine, O
serine, O
proline, O
phenylalanine, O
4-aminobutyrat O
and O
leucine. O
The O
decrease O
of O
these O
compounds O
indicates O
their O
importance O
during O
the O
defence. O

Of O
these, O
81 O
of O
the O
respondents O
were O
active O
farmers. O
Two O

were O
researchers O

and O
one O
was O
no O

These O
three O
responses O
were O
excluded O
from O
the O
responses O
reported O
below. O
The O
data O
were O
summarized O
and O

using O
Qualtrics O

Excel O
(Microsoft O

Statistical O

were O
conducted O
using O
SAS O
University O
Edition O
(SAS O

). O
Forty-five O
survey O
respondents O
provided O
their O
name O
and O
contact O
information O
for O
a O
follow-up O
interview. O
Nineteen O
organic O
barley O
producers O
were O
interviewed O
between O
November O
4, O
2019, O
and O
January O
3, O
2020. O
Interviewees O
were O
selected O
from O
the O
pool O
of O
volunteers O
based O
on O
geographic O
diversity, O
experience O
with O
organic O
farming O
systems, O
and O
operation O
size, O
in O
order O
to O
represent O
different O
scales. O
The O
operations O
were O
almost O
evenly O
divided O
between O
dryland O
(10) O
and O
irrigated O
(9) O
farming O
systems. O
The O
main O
purpose O
of O
the O
interviews O
was O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
the O
specific O
obstacles O
that O
organic O
growers O
face O
in O
producing O
and O
marketing O
organic O
barley O
and O
how O
a O
breeding O
program O
can O
help O
address O
these O
concerns. O
The O
authors O
designed O
an O
interview O
template O
that O
included O
questions O
about O
production O
practices, O
costs O
of O
production, O
and O
specific O
obstacles O
to O
growing O
high-quality O
barley. O
The O
interviews O
were O
structured O
in O
three O
parts. O
The O
first O
was O
a O
narrative O
description O
about O
how O
barley O
fits O
into O
the O
interviewee’s O
rotation O
and O
farming O
system. O
The O
second O
involved O
detailed O
information O
on O
their O
practices, O
operations, O
costs O
of O
production, O
and O
returns O
for O
growing O
barley. O
The O
third O
part O
was O
open-ended O
and O
gave O
the O
interviewees O
an O
opportunity O
to O
explain O
their O
needs O
and O
preferences O
for O
barley O
traits O
in O
greater O
detail. O
The O
interviewees O
were O
asked O
in-depth O
questions O
that O
expanded O
on O
the O
questions O
presented O
in O
the O
survey O
and O
provided O
greater O
detail O
about O
production O
obstacles O
and O
how O
barley O
breeding O
could O
help O
overcome O
those O
challenges. O
Interview O
subjects O
were O
asked O
to O
provide O
detailed O
information O
about O
their O
farming O
operations. O
Actual O
cost O
data O
were O
used O
when O
readily O
available. O
If O
the O
producers O
could O
not O
directly O
provide O
costs O
of O
production, O
the O
data O
provided O
about O
farming O
operations O
were O
used O
to O
estimate O
equipment O
fuel, O
operation, O
and O
maintenance O
costs O
based O
on O
the O
manufacturer’s O
specifications, O
engineering O
references, O
and O
the O
most O
recent O
edition O
of O
relevant O
Cooperative O
Extension O
data O
(Downs O
and O
Hansen O
1998 O
; O
Grisso O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Painter O
2011 O
). O

Data O
retrieved O
from O
Boot O
et O
al. O
2018 O
Clustering O
the O
transcriptional O
response O
revealed O
that O
cyp139a1, O
cyp121a1, O
cyp126a1, O
and O
cyp137a1 O
together O
with O
FdxB, O
was O
the O
most O
prominently O
upregulated O
cluster O
for O
all O
five O
drugs O
(Fig. O
3 O
). O
Interestingly, O
and O
as O
previously O
mentioned, O
cyp139a1 O
is O
immediately O
downstream O
of O
three O
polyketide O
synthase O
(pks) O
genes O
and O
upstream O
of O
Rv1667c, O
a O
gene O
encoding O
an O
ATP-binding O
cassette O
(ABC) O
superfamily O
transporter. O
The O
expression O
of O
the O
three O
pks O
is O
downregulated O
except O
for O
pks17 O
and O
pks9 O
genes O
(Rv1663 O
and O
Rv1664, O
respectively) O
upon O
exposure O
to O
ciprofloxacin O
and O
rifampicin. O
In O
contrast, O
Rv1667c O
is O
also O
induced O
upon O
exposure O
to O
first-line O
antibiotics O
(Zhang O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
Boot O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
Furthermore, O
it O
can O
also O
be O
speculated O
that O
increased O
expression O
of O
cyp139a1 O
(or O
one O
of O
the O
other O
CYPs) O
contributes O
to O
the O
intrinsic O
resistance O
of O
Mtb O
to O
anti-TB O
agents. O
Cyp143a1 O
and O
its O
tentative O
associated O
cognate O
redox O
partner, O
Rv1786 O
(FdxE), O
were O
upregulated O
after O
exposure O
to O
these O
antibiotics O
(Fig. O
3 O
) O
(Boot O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
Furthermore, O
the O
expression O
of O
Rv1790, O
encoding O
PPE27, O
was O
also O
upregulated O
whereas O
other O
genes O
in O
the O
ESX-5 O
cluster O
were O
downregulated O
or O
relatively O
unaffected O
(Boot O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
In O
addition, O
FdxA O
was O
also O
induced O
by O
exposure O
to O
anti-TB O
compounds, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
protein O
is O
a O
key O
player O
in O
pathways O
to O
resist O
insults O
Mtb O
may O
encounter O
in O
vivo O
(Fischer O
et O
al. O
2002 O
; O
Voskuil O
et O

al. O
2008; O
Namouchi O
et O
al. O
2016 O
; O
Boot O

2018 O
). O

Overall, O
methanolic O
extract O
exhibited O
the O
most O
potent O
antibacterial O
activities O
(Fig. O
2 O
b) O
compared O
to O
seed O
oil, O
n-hexane O
and O
aqueous O
extracts O
against O
MDR O
strains. O
J. O
curcas O
seed O
oil O
did O
not O
exhibit O
any O
antibacterial O
activity O
against O
any O
MDR O
strain. O
The O
most O
resistant O
MDR O
strain O
was O
P. O
monteilii O
against O
which O
none O
of O
the O
extracts O
and O
seed O
oil O
exhibited O
any O
antibacterial O
activity. O
In O
case O
of O
antibiotics O
for O
clinical O
isolates, O
the O
highest O
antibacterial O
activity O
was O
exhibited O
by O
moxifloxacin O
with O
a O
ZOI O
~ O
46 O
mm O
against O
P. O
aeruginosa O
(Fig. O

c) O
and O
was O
significantly O
higher O
(P O
&lt; O
0.001) O
than O
that O
of O
ciprofloxacin, O
cefotaxime, O
rifampicin O
and O
ofloxacin O
(control O
drug). O
Moxifloxacin O
exhibited O
comparatively O
more O
potent O
antibacterial O
activities O
against O
all O
clinical O
strains O
except O
P. B-PATH
vulgaris I-PATH
and O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
(Fig. O

c). O
Rifampicin O
and O
cefotaxime O
had O
the O
least O
potent O
antibacterial O
activities O
against O
all O
selected O
clinical O
isolates O
(Fig. O
2 O
c) O
with O
the O
only O
exception O
of O
A. B-PATH
baumannii I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
vulgaris I-PATH
against O
which O
rifampicin O
and O
cefotaxime O
exhibited O
higher O
antibacterial O
activities O
with O
ZOI O
33 O
and O
36 O
mm, O
respectively. O
Rifampicin O
exhibited O
significantly O
higher O
(P O
&lt; O
0.001) O
antibacterial O
activity O
compared O
to O
other O
antibiotics O
against O
A. O
baumannii. O
Moxifloxacin O
and O
ciprofloxacin O
mostly O
exhibited O
potent O
antibacterial O
activities O
showing O
slight O
variation O
with O
ofloxacin O
(positive O
control) O
against O
clinical O
isolates. O
Conversely, O
in O
reference O
strains, O
moxifloxacin O
exhibited O
significantly O
higher O
(P O
&lt; O
0.001) O
antibacterial O
activity O
compared O
to O
all O
other O
antibiotics O
against O
E. O

(ATCC O

strain. O

Our O
survey O
does O
not O
present O
cause O
for O
despair. O
In O
terms O
of O
participant O
diversity, O
evolutionary O
psychology O
does O
rely O
on O
WEIRD, O
student O
samples O
less O
heavily O
than O
some O
fields O
(Apicella O
and O
Barrett O
2016 O
; O
Kurzban O
2013 O
). O
However, O
this O
is O
perhaps O
in O
part O
because O
of O
the O
discipline’s O
need O
for O
cross-cultural O
surveys O
to O
validate O
theories O
that O
claim O
to O
purport O
to O
humans O
as O
a O
species. O
Evolutionary O
psychology O
has O
a O
greater O
need O
for O
cross-cultural O
replications O
than O
other O
disciplines, O
such O
as O
those O
focussed O
around O
basic O
psychophysics O
where O
we O
might O
more O
easily O
assume O
universal O
underlying O
mechanics, O
or O
more O
descriptive O
research O
approaches O
that O
aim O
to O
uncover O
behaviour O
in O
culturally-specific O
environments, O
such O
as O
the O
workplace O
or O
social O
media O
sites. O
We O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
imply O
either O
that O
sample O
diversity O
should O
be O
the O
only O
goal; O
there O
are O
many O
valuable O
ways O
to O
add O
to O
our O
understanding O
of O
any O
phenomenon. O
Valuable O
extensions O
to O
research O
on O
a O
WEIRD, O
student O
sample O
can O
arise, O
for O
instance, O
from O
adding O
methodological O
diversity, O
developing O
theoretical O
frameworks, O
creating O
models O
of O
the O
behaviour, O
or O
testing O
similar O
behaviours O
in O
other O
species. O
Developmental O
approaches O
can O
make O
a O
useful O
testing O
ground O
for O
adaptive O
predictions, O
given O
that O
individuals O
have O
different O
adaptive O
needs O
across O
their O
life O
course, O
but O
we O
note O
that O
only O
8% O
of O
the O
samples O
that O
we O
coded O
used O
child O
participants. O
Scientists, O
including O
evolutionary O
psychologists, O
are O
increasingly O
recognising O
the O
value O
in O
replication O
across O
multiple O
labs O
and O
samples O
(e.g. O
Camerer O
et O
al. O
2016 O
; O
Ebersole O
et O
al. O
2016 O
; O
Errington O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Zwaan O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
In O
this O
light, O
it O
is O
of O
interest O
that O
the O
first O
study O
to O
be O
accepted O
by O
the O
Psychological O
Science O
Accelerator O
( O
https://psysciacc.wordpress.com/ O
), O
a O
project O
that O
uses O
multiple O
laboratories O
to O
test O
hypotheses, O
was O
proposed O
by O
two O
researchers, O
Jones O
and O
DeBruine, O
whose O
work O
often O
draws O
upon O
a O
functional O
framework. O

Our O
results O
showed O
that O
the O
mutants O
consistently O
accumulated O
more O
fatty O
acids O
than O
Guy11 O
on O
both O
CM O
and O
MM O
( O
Fig. O
3b O
). O
Furthermore, O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
produced O
more O
fatty O
acids O
on O
CM O
than O
on O
MM O
( O
Fig. O
3b O
), O
which O
may O
explain O
our O
observation O
that O
the O
mutants O
showed O
more O
severe O
growth O
and O
conidiation O
defects O
on O
CM. O
To O
further O
understand O
the O
impact O
of O
fatty O
acids O
accumulation O
on O
the O
growth O
and O
conidiation O
of O
M. O
oryzae, O
we O
treated O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
with O
sodium O
acetate O
(NaAc) O
to O
rescue O
the O
mutant O
defects. O
Our O
results O
showed O
that O
this O
treatment O
almost O
fully O
recovered O
the O
colony O
color O
and O
growth O
rate O
of O
the O
mutants O
( O
Figs O
3c O
and O
S4a). O
Moreover, O
the O
conidial O
production O
of O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
was O
largely O
restored O
when O
growing O
on O
NaAc-treated O
CM O
( O
Figs O
3d O
and O
S4b). O
In O
addition, O
the O
carbonate O
Na O
2 O
CO O
3 O
displayed O
similar O
effect O
to O
NaAc O
in O
rescuing O
the O
mutant O
defects O
( O
Figs O
3c,d O
and O
S4). O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
are O
defective O
in O
pathogenicity O
Mitochondrial O
β O
oxidation O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
infection-related O
development O
in O
plant O
pathogenic O
fungi O
26 O
, O
but O
the O
role O
of O
downstream O
electron O
transfer O
flavoprotein O
in O
pathogenicity O
is O
still O
unknown. O
So O
we O
set O
to O
clarify O
whether O
the O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutations O
could O
affect O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
M. O
oryzae. O
As O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
did O
not O
produce O
conidia O
on O
CM, O
we O
used O
mycelia O
blocks O
to O
inoculate O
excised O
barley O
and O
rice O
leaves. O
Our O
results O
showed O
that O
the O
mutant O
mycelia O
completely O
failed O
to O
cause O
disease O
on O
barley O
and O
rice O
( O
Fig. O
4a O
), O
consistent O
with O
the O
result O
of O
the O
insertion O
mutant O
30-152. O
In O
this O
regard, O
NaAc O
was O
unable O
to O
recover O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
the O
mutants. O
Figure O

ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
were O
defective O
in O

This O
agrees O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
bioluminescence O
in O
Photorhabdus O
as O
a O
non-functional O
evolutionary O

that O
has O
not O

as O
proposed O
earlier O
by O
Peat O

Adams O
( O

). O
Molecular O

To O
assess O
the O

the O
Xenorhabdus O

Photorhabdus O
bacteria, O
comparison O
of O
molecular O

has O
been O
frequently O
used O
(e.g. O
Maiden O

1998 O
; O
Tailliez O
et O

2006 O
; O
Adams O
et O

). O
Recently, O
whole-genome O

increasingly O
support O
studies O
on O
the O
diversity, O
biology, O
and O
evolutionary O
relationships O
of O
EPN O

(Murfin O

). O
Indeed, O
consideration O
of O
full O

has O
uncovered O
the O
large O
genomic O

among O
the O

(Wilkinson O

; O
Murfin O

). O
It O
is O
now O
clear O
that O
the O
genomes O
of O
EPN O
bacteria O
encode O
diverse O
antibiotics, O
adhesins, O
hemolysins, O
proteases, O

lipases, O
which O
are O
crucial O
for O
successful O
host O

and O
bioconversion O
of O
the O

(Bode O
2009 O
). O
In O
fact, O
analysis O
of O
the O
P. O
luminescens O

genome O
revealed O
that O
nearly O
6% O
of O
the O
genome O

encode O
secondary O
metabolites, O
highlighting O
the O
potential O
of O
these O
bacteria O
for O
discovery O
of O
new O
drugs O
(Duchaud O
et O
al. O
2003 O
). O
Studies O
have O
established O
that O
many O
virulence O
genes O
of O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
are O
located O
within O
pathogenicity O
islands, O
probably O
acquired O
by O
extensive O
horizontal O

(Waterfield O

Genes O

Their O

Most O
of O
the O

were O
related O
to O
economic O

cited O
as O
the O
two O
main O
obstacles O
by O
nearly O
half O
of O
all O

“Not O

was O
given O
as O
the O
main O
obstacle O
by O
19% O
and O
“doesn’t O

was O
the O
reason O
for O
10%. O
All O

as O
obstacles O
by O
less O

pests. O
“Other” O
reasons O

were O
also O
more O

economic O

Producers O
reported O
lacking O
the O

as O
obstacles. O

The O
average O
premium O
was O
115%, O
more O
than O
double O
the O

but O
individual O

reported O
a O

those O
whose O
crop O
went O
mostly O
or O

received O
an O
average O
premium O
of O
97%. O
Some O
of O
those O
using O

sometimes O
in O
the O

grain. O
Those O
who O
were O
primarily O

producers O
received O
a O
premium O
of O
131% O
on O
average. O
Those O
selling O
into O
the O
food O
market O
reported O
only O
a O
68% O
average O
premium O
over O
non-organic. O
Seed O
producers O
reported O
a O
consistent O
premium O
of O
120% O
over O
conventional. O
Desired O

Producers O
were O
also O
asked O
about O
the O

found O
most O
desirable. O
Table O

by O
a O

Nearly O
half O
the O

A O

the O

Inflammatory O

which O

The O

We O
speculate O
this O
is O
because O

that O
takes O

with O
our O
recent O

show O
the O
highly O
conserved O
nature O
of O
the O
CLO/PXG O
motifs, O
both O
in O
terms O
of O
their O
amino O
composition O
and O
their O
position O
in O
the O
protein, O
across O
the O
entire O
fungal O
kingdom. O
The O
five O
main O
motifs, O
numbered O
from O
the O
N-terminus O
as O
1–2–3-4-5, O
occur O
in O
the O
same O
order O
in O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
344 O
analysed O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
sequences. O
In O
some O
sequences O
the O
MEME O
software O
failed O
to O
detect O
one O
or O
more O
of O
these O
motifs O
but O
manual O
inspection O
revealed O
that O
this O
was O
due O
to O
small O
changes O
in O
a O
few O
amino O
acids O
that O
resulted O
in O
a O
lack O
of O
recognition O
of O
the O
motif O
by O
MEME O
although O
its O
major O
features O
were O
in O
fact O
present O
and O
intact. O
For O
example, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
basal O
species, O
Rozella O
allomyces, O
three O
of O
the O
five O
major O
CLO/PXG O
motifs O
appear O
to O
be O
missing O
according O
to O
MEME O
(final O
line O
in O
Fig. O
1b O
), O
but O
manual O
inspection O
shows O
that O
the O
‘missing’ O
motifs O
2, O
4 O
and O
5 O
are O
essentially O
present, O
albeit O
in O
somewhat O
modified O
form O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
fungal O
sequences. O
Despite O
extensive O
trials, O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
find O
any O
better O
motif O
prediction O
software O
than O
MEME O
for O
this O
particular O
analysis O
but O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
even O
MEME O
is O
not O
always O
fully O
reliable. O
Nevertheless, O
the O
method O
is O
still O
useful O
for O
a O
broad-brush O
analysis O
of O
large O
numbers O
of O
sequences, O
with O
the O
proviso O
that O
manual O
curation O
is O
still O
required O
for O
more O
accurate O
results. O
One O
example O
of O
a O
useful O
prediction O
from O
MEME O
was O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O

Ustilago O
maydis O
was O
the O
species O
with O
most O
common O
names; O
even O
so, O
it O
was O
previously O
thought O
that O
this O
fungus O
was O
not O
traditionally O
consumed O
in O
Jalisco O
(Guzmán-Dávalos O
1992 O
). O
The O
mestizos O
called O
this O
cuervo O
(raven) O
for O
the O
black O
colour O
and O
its O
relationship O
with O
maize. O
In O
addition, O
the O
names O
huilanconche O
and O
pitacoche O
were O
recorded. O
These O
latter O
two O
terms O
are O
phonetic O
modifications O
of O
the O
term O
cuitlacoche O
(corn O
smut), O
a O
term O
which O
originated O
in O
central O
Mexico O
(Guzmán O
2008 O
). O
Meanwhile, O
the O
Wixaritari O
named O
mushrooms O
with O
a O
single O
word, O
such O
as O
yekwá O
(Amanita O
laurae O
or O
A. O
basii) O
or O
wakanari O
(Marasmius O
oreades), O
or O
with O
two O
words, O
such O
as O
utuxa O
yekwá O
(Volvariella O
bombycina), O
utuxa O
being O
their O
name O
for O
Ipomea O
intrapilosa. O
When O
a O
binomial O
name O
was O
used, O
the O
first O
word O
was O
related O
to O
the O
plant O
or O
animal O
association, O
and O
the O
second O
to O
the O
form, O
although O
the O
order O
was O
reversed O
in O
some O
cases, O
with O
the O
first O
word O
referring O
to O
morphology O
and O
the O
second O
to O
colour. O
The O
names O
of O
mushrooms O
considered O
toxic O
were O
accompanied O
by O
the O
epithet O
‘itaikarieya, O
from O
‘itaikari, O
which O
means O
essence, O
spirit, O
or O
ghost, O
such O
as O
yekwá O
‘itaikarieya O
(A. O
muscaria) O
or O
kutsiyari O
after O
Kutsi, O
who O
was O
the O
grandmother O
creator O
and O
first O
woman O
in O
Wixarika O
mythology, O
who O
germinated O
all O
plants O
and O
living O
creatures O
of O
the O
world O
(Perrin O
1994 O
; O
Neurath O
2002 O
; O
Iturrioz-Leza O
2004 O
). O
These O
concepts O
lack O
a O
literal O
translation, O
thus O
the O
Wixaritari O
have O
referred O
to O
these O
mushrooms O
in O
Spanish O
as O
hongos O
de O
Dios O
(mushrooms O
from O
God). O
Some O
mushroom O
names O
used O
by O
mestizos O
were O
introduced O
by O
the O
Wixaritari. O

the O

In O

valsartan-treated O

develop O
significant O

The O

observed O
in O
other O

and O
could O
be O
attributed O
to O
increase O

through O
upregulation O
of O

4 O
(GLUT4) O
(Guan O

(Winiarska O

Conversely, O

that O
valsartan O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
blood O

one O
proposed O
explanation O
for O
the O
controversy O
regarding O
valsartan O
effect O
on O

may O
be O
due O
to O
experimental O
changes O

Previous O

declared O
that O
hyperglycemia O
could O
increase O
the O
expression O
of O
NOX4 O
mRNA O
in O
both O
direct O
and O
indirect O
pathways. O
The O
direct O
effect O
is O
through O
activation O
of O
the O
NF-kB O
pathway, O
mediated O
by O
p62/PKζ O
interaction O
(Xi O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
The O
indirect O
effect O
achieved O
through O
induction O
of O

that O

Similarly, O

According O
to O
our O

Cbrown O

did O
not O
show O
a O

Both O

In O

The O
distribution O
of O
Cbrown O
could O
not O
be O
explained O
in O
an O
ecological O

Overall, O
Cbrown O
and O
N O
meso O
have O
a O
relatively O
low O
impact O
on O
canopy O
reflectance O
56 O
and O
do O
not O
greatly O
contribute O
to O
the O
spectral O
differentiation O
of O
variations O
in O
plant O
functioning O
57 O
. O
All O
trait O
measurements O
used O
in O
this O
study O
were O
retrieved O
from O
plants O
cultivated O
under O
optimal O
growth O
conditions. O
It O
can O
be O
expected O
that O
some O
traits O
more O
explicitly O
express O
their O
functional O
role O
under O
non-optimal O
environmental O
conditions. O
For O
instance, O
increased O
leaf O
anthocyanin O
content O
has O
been O
observed O
during O
pathogen O
infections O
58 O
. O
Furthermore, O
a O
plant’s O
ability O
to O
cope O
with O
excess O
incident O
radiation O
can O
be O
expressed O
through O
developing O
ample O
leaf O
carotenoid O
content O
27 O
. O
A O
limitation O
of O
our O
study O
was O
the O
initial O
definition O
and O
selection O
of O
plant O
traits. O
Plant O
traits O
such O
as O
Leaf O
Area O
Index O
and O
the O
Average O
Leaf O
Angle O
are O
abstractions O
of O
complex O
canopy O
structural O
properties, O
and O
may O
not O
fully O
reflect O
subtle O
differences O
in O
plant O
functioning. O
Further O
errors O
are O
introduced O
by O
the O
trait O
measurementsand O
the O
analysis, O
such O
as O
GAM O
extrapolations, O
and O
the O
abstraction O
of O
plant O
functioning O
in O
the O
CSR O
model O
29 O
and O
the O
LES O
3 O
. O
Yet, O
given O
that O
plant O
functioning O
and O
the O
radiative O
transfer O
in O
plant O
canopies O
are O
two O
complex O
fields O
on O
its O
own, O
empirically O
testing O
the O
links O
between O
these O
two O
realms O
requires O
a O
certain O
level O
of O
abstraction. O
Despite O
these O
uncertainties, O
our O
results O
showed O
unprecedented O
links O
between O
functioning O
and O
reflectance, O
hopefully O
triggering O
further O
advances O
towards O
this O
field O
using O
more O
sophisticated O
methods. O
Conclusion O
and O
Outlook O
Optical O
remote O
sensing O
data O
is O
potentially O
highly O
informative O
to O
track O
Earth’s O

diversity. O
Yet, O
causal O
explanations O
on O
why O
plant O

can O
be O
differentiated O
using O
canopy O
reflectance O
sensed O
by O
optical O
Earth O

remain O
limited. O
Our O
findings O
demonstrate O
that O
bridging O
ecological O
theory O
and O
canopy O
reflectance O
through O

modelling O
enables O
us O
to O
identify O
causal O

[ O

]. O
Primary O
symptoms O
include O
appearance O
of O
a O
characteristic O
pruritic O
vesicular O
rash, O
as O
well O
as O
fever, O
malaise, O
anorexia, O
headache, O
and O
abdominal O
pain, O
occurring O
either O
concurrently, O
or O
1–2 O
days O
before O

appearance O
[ O

]. O
Although O
usually O
following O
a O
benign O
course O
of O
disease, O
varicella O
can O
result O
in O
serious O
complications. O
In O
pediatric O
inpatient O
populations, O
the O
most O
commonly O
observed O
are O
skin O
and O
soft O
tissue O
infections, O
and O
neurological O
complications O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
up O
to O
28% O
of O
varicella O
outpatients O
have O
been O
found O
to O
report O
complications O
[ O
8 O
], O
with O
skin O
and O
soft O
tissue O
infections O
accounting O
for O
up O
to O
90% O
of O
these O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Consequently, O
treatment O
of O
varicella-related O
complications O
in O
both O
inpatient O
and O
outpatient O
settings O
may O
involve O
use O
of O
antibiotic O
agents. O
Recently, O
concerns O
over O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
have O
increased O
[ O
9 O
]. O
Proposed O
efforts O
to O
address O
resistance O
include O
antibiotic O
stewardship O
programs, O
aimed O
at O
improving O
antibiotic O
use O
to O
conserve O
effectiveness O
and O
reduce O
emergence O
of O
resistant O
strains, O
and O
use O
of O
vaccines O
to O
prevent O
infections O
that O
may O
result O
in O
antibiotic O
use O
[ O
9 O
, O

]. O
In O
this O
context, O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
analysis O
is O
to O
characterize O
the O
rate, O
appropriateness O
and O
patterns O
of O
antibiotic O
use O
for O
management O
of O
varicella-associated O
complications O
in O

Background O
Pneumocystis B-PATH
jirovecii I-PATH
(P. B-PATH
jirovecii) I-PATH
is O
an O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
with O
a O
high O
colonisation O
rate O
in O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
(HIV) O
infections. O
Pneumocystis O
jirovecii O
pneumonia O
(PJP) O
is O
a O
severe O
lung O
disease O
caused O
by O
the O
massive O
proliferation O
of O
P. B-PATH
jirovecii I-PATH
in O
the O
lungs, O
and O
it O
is O
most O
common O
in O
acquired O
immunodeficiency O
syndrome O
(AIDS) O
patients. O
Identification O
of O
AIDS O
patients O
is O
valuable O
for O
diagnosing O
PJP. O
As O
technology O
has O
progressed, O
more O
methods O
of O
detecting O
HIV O
antibodies O
have O
emerged. O
Various O
detection O
methods O
have O
been O
developed O
and O
have O
become O
more O
sensitive. O
In O
China, O
the O
initial O
screening O
and O
diagnostic O
tests O
for O
HIV O
are O
mainly O
performed O
by O
applying O
different O
methods O
to O
detect O
serum O
HIV O
antibodies O
[ O
1 O
]. O
However, O
for O
AIDS O
patients O
who O
are O
HIV-seronegative, O
regardless O
of O
how O
advanced O
the O
serum O
antibody O
detection O
technology O
is, O
diagnosis O
will O
fail. O
Misdiagnosis O
or O
missed O
diagnosis O
of O
HIV O
infections O
will O
not O
only O
result O
in O
a O
lack O
of O
timely O
treatment O
for O
the O
HIV O
infection O
but O
will O
also O
confound O
diagnosing O
HIV O
infection-related O
diseases O
such O
as O
PJP, O
primary O
pulmonary O
Kaposi O
sarcoma O
(KS), O
and O
toxoplasma O
encephalopathy. O
However, O
to O
date, O
HIV-seronegative O
AIDS O
cases O
are O
rare; O
only O
27 O
cases O
have O
been O
reported O
globally. O
A O
recent O
case O
reported O
by O
Zhang O
et O
al. O
[ O
2 O
] O
was O
the O
first O
HIV-seronegative O
AIDS O
case O
reported O
in O
China. O
However, O
at O
least O
in O
China, O
the O
current O
practice O
is O
that O
nucleic O
acid O
testing O
is O
not O
required O
in O
HIV O
initial O
screening O
tests O
according O
to O
the O
guidelines O
[ O
1 O
]. O
With O
the O
increase O
in O
such O
reported O
cases, O
more O
importance O
will O
be O
attached O
to O
nucleic O
acid O
tests O
to O
screen O
out O
HIV O
infection. O
Herein, O
we O
report O
an O
HIV-seronegative O
AIDS O
case O
that O
may O
lead O
to O
new O
arguments O
for O
HIV O
nucleic O
acid O
testing. O

The O

was O
used O
to O
compare O
the O

of O
the O
18 O
R. O
anatipestifer O
strains. O
The O
results O
are O

Table O

The O

of O
the O
ATCC O
11845, O
RCAD0122, O
RCAD0125, O
and O
RCAD0134 O
strains O
were O
identical, O
and O
their O
rifampin O
MICs O
were O
all O
less O
than O
0.5 O
μg/mL; O
therefore, O
they O
were O
all O
categorized O
as O
rifampin-sensitive. O
The O
remaining O
14 O
R. O
anatipestifer O
isolates O
all O
had O
rpoB O
mutations, O
including O
nine O
types O
of O

mutations O
V382I, O
H491N, O
R494K, O
G502K, O
T528I, O
S539Y, O
A930T, O
T937A, O
and O
A993T. O
The O
MICs O
of O
these O
14 O
R. O
anatipestifer O
strains O
on O
rifampin O
varied O
widely, O
ranging O
from O
less O
than O
0.5 O
μg/mL O
to O
more O
than O
256 O
μg/mL. O
There O
were O
four O
mutations, O
T528I, O
A930T, O
T937A O
and O
A993T O
in O
the O
RCAD0150 O
strain O
that O
were O
also O
sensitive O
to O
rifampin. O
Therefore, O
we O
considered O
that O
the O
rpoB O
mutation O
sites O
in O
RCAD0150 O
had O
little O
contribution O
to O
rifampin O
resistance, O
and O
these O
sites O
would O
be O
used O
as O
mutation O
sites O
that O
have O
no O
significant O
effect O
on O
rifampin O
resistance O
during O
the O
analysis. O
Therefore, O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
five O
amino O
acid O
differences O
were O
related O
to O
rifampin O
resistance, O
V382I, O
H491N, O
G502K, O
R494K, O
and O
S539Y. O

Additionally, O
the O

Whereas O
we: O
1) O
used O

mice, O
2) O
exposed O
mice O
to O
aerosolized O
Ova O
for O
20 O

infected O

prior O

(ROO) O
or O
immediately O
following O
the O
last O
Ova O

(OOR). O
Although O
the O

of O
any O

did O
not O
correlate O
with O

the O
ratio O

in O
the O

correlated O
fairly O
well O
with O

(OVA: O

Culley O
and O
colleagues O
in O
their O
neonatal O
model O
of O
RSV O
infection O
[ O
13 O
] O
demonstrated O
that O
RSV O
infection O
of O
young O
mice O
(0–14 O
d O
of O
age) O
produced O
more O
severe O
disease O
initially O
and O
upon O
subsequent O
rechallenge O
than O
did O
infection O
of O
adult O
mice. O
In O
fact, O
the O
younger O
the O
mouse O
upon O
initial O
RSV O
infection, O
the O
stronger O
the O
Th2 O
polarized O
immune O
response O
to O
RSV O
upon O
secondary O
infection. O
Furthermore, O
human O
data O
suggested O
a O
link O
between O
RSV O
lower O
respiratory O

infections O
in O
infancy O
and O
the O
later O
development O
of O
asthma O
[ O
5 O
– O
10 O
]. O
Thus, O
we O
were O
expecting O
to O
see O
pulmonary O
changes O
in O
weanling O
mice O
(21 O
d O
of O
age) O
exposed O
to O
RSV O
alone O
(RSS). O
However, O
we O
failed O
to O
see O
any O
pathophysiological O
response O
to O
RSV O
alone O
(RSS O
and O
SSR) O
or O
to O
weanling O
exposure O
to O
RSV O
followed O
by O
allergen O
(ROO). O
Although O
this O
data O
was O
unexpected, O
we O
feel O
that O
it O
further O
supports O
Culley's O
original O

Although O

that O
earlier O

Discussion O
Here, O
we O
show O
that O
PLG O
plays O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
regulating O
the O
neuroimmune O
response O
to O
a O
peripheral O
immune O
challenge O
with O
LPS. O
We O
have O
previously O
reported O
that O
plasmin, O
the O
active O
serine O
protease O
form O
of O
PLG, O
is O
likely O
responsible O
for O
the O
regulation O
of O
this O
activity, O
and O
have O
shown O
that O
treatment O
with O
PLG O
ASO O
is O
specific O
in O
knocking O
down O
plasma O
levels O
of O
PLG O
without O
affecting O
brain O
expression O
of O
various O
proteins O
in O
the O
PLG O
activator O
pathway O
[ O
7 O
]. O
In O
the O
current O
study, O
we O
add O
evidence O
that O
plasmin O
is O
a O
key O
modulator O
of O
communication O
between O
the O
nervous O
system O
and O
the O
immune O
system. O
Activation O
of O
the O
innate O
immune O
system O
is O
a O
crucial O
step O
for O
the O
body O
when O
battling O
pathogens. O
However, O
when O
this O
activation O
becomes O
chronic, O
it O
can O
have O
detrimental O
effects. O

Determining O
the O
specific O
factors O
that O
drive O
chlamydial O
disease O
progression O
in O
susceptible O
individuals O
is O
an O
important O
priority O
in O
chlamydial O
research. O
We O
found O
that O
urogenital O
tract O
disease O
progression O
was O
significantly O
associated O
with O
the O
chlamydial O
infection O
load O
at O
that O
anatomical O
site, O
and O
that O
koalas O
with O
high O
infection O
loads O
at O
their O
urogenital O
tract O
site O
progressed O
to O
disease O
more O
rapidly. O
Further, O
our O
data O
show O
that O
infection O
loads O
at O
the O
urogenital O
tract O
site O
were O
significantly O
higher O
when O
koalas O
acquired O
an O
infection O
in O
the O
preceding O
three O
months, O
with O
loads O
then O
declining O
to O
a O
relatively O
stable O
level O
in O
chronically O
infected O
koalas. O
Shedding O
of O
Chlamydia O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
governed O
by O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
host O
immune O
response O
and O
pathogen O
growth O
kinetics, O
and O
further O
focused O
study O
investigating O
the O
host O
immune O
response O
and O
levels O
of O
shedding O
during O
infection O
would O
be O
valuable. O
We O
also O
found O
that O
effective O
antibiotic O
treatment O
of O
chlamydial O
disease O
21 O
conferred O
only O
short-term O
immunity O
to O
reinfection, O
even O
by O
the O
same O
ompA-characterised O
chlamydial O
strain. O
Consistent O
with O
the O
theory O
that O
immune-mediated O
pathogenesis O
is O
a O
driver O
of O
the O
severity O
of O
chlamydial O
disease O
16 O
, O
28 O
, O
‘severe’ O
chlamydial O
disease O
was O
associated O
with O
prior O
chlamydial O
exposure. O
Some O
koalas, O
however, O
developed O
negative O
sequelae O
such O
as O
infertility O
and O
mortality, O
without O
prior O
or O
ongoing O
exposure O
to O
Chlamydia, O
demonstrating O
that O
severe O
immune-mediated O
disease O
can O
also O
occur O
in O
naïve O
individuals O
22 O
. O
Together, O
these O
findings O
highlight O
the O
fact O
that O
both O
new O
and O
repeated O
chlamydial O
infections O
can O
have O
serious O
consequences, O
and O
management O
interventions O
that O
reduce O
the O
transmission O
of O
Chlamydia O
and O
improve O
immune O
responses, O
such O
as O
vaccination, O
will O
be O
important O
in O
the O
future. O
Several O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
genetically O
distinct O
chlamydial O
strains, O
as O
characterised O
by O
ompA O
genotypes, O
may O
reflect O
both O
tissue O
tropisms O
and O
pathogenicity O
in O
koalas O
11 O
, O
29 O
, O
demonstrating O
the O
complexity O
of O
chlamydial O
pathogenesis. O

Discussion O
Promoting O
the O
rapid O
repair O
of O
full-thickness O
skin O
defects O
caused O
by O
severe O
burns O
and O
improving O
wound O
healing O
quality O
are O
significant O
challenges O
in O
burn O
treatment. O
The O
results O
of O
this O
study O
show O
that O
using O
minced O
split-thickness O
skin O
grafts O
with O
Pelnac O
as O
an O
overlay O
accelerates O
wound O
healing O
through O
enhanced O
cell O
proliferation O
and O
neovascularization. O
This O
treatment O
also O
stimulated O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
complete O
basement O
membrane O
connecting O
the O
epidermal O
and O
dermal O
layers O
of O
skin O
and O
alleviated O
scarring O
via O
modulation O
of O
collagen O
deposition O
and O
TGF-β O
expression. O
Cell O
proliferation O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
repair O
and O
regeneration O
of O
damaged O
tissue. O
The O
expression O
of O
Ki-67, O
a O
marker O
of O
proliferation, O
was O
higher O
in O
the O
Pelnac O
group O
than O
in O
the O
Vaseline O
group, O
indicating O
that O
Pelnac O
may O
accelerate O
wound O
healing O
by O
providing O
a O
physical O
scaffold O
for O
proliferating O
cells. O
The O
local O
microenvironment O
of O
the O
wound O
also O
influences O
tissue O
repair. O
We O
found O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
VEGF—which O
regulates O
angiogenesis—was O
elevated O
in O
the O
Pelnac O
group, O
which O
could O
also O
promote O
wound O
healing. O
Pelnac O
also O
decreased O
and O
increased O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
scar-related O
growth O
factors O
TGF-β1 O
and O
TGF-β3, O
respectively, O
to O
minimize O
scar O
formation. O
Disruption O
of O
the O
basement O
membrane O
leads O
to O
skin O
fragility O
and O
blistering O
[ O
22 O
]. O
The O
basement O
membrane O
and O
underlying O
dermis O
play O
critical O
roles O
in O
skin O
maturation O
and O
function O
by O
regulating O
keratinocyte O
growth O
and O
terminal O
differentiation O
[ O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
Deep O
burns O
can O
damage O
dermal O
tissue. O
Although O
transplantation O
of O
micrografts O
at O
a O
specific O
expansion O
ratio O
can O
enhance O
wound O
epithelialization, O
the O
basement O
membrane O
cannot O
be O
established. O
Without O
a O
connection O
between O
the O
new O
epidermal O
and O
dermal O
layers, O
the O
epidermis O
can O
readily O
blister O
and O
fall O
off, O
resulting O
in O
chronic O
ulcers. O
We O
found O
here O
that O
an O
intact O
basement O
membrane O
was O
present O
in O
the O
Pelnac O
group. O

Together, O
these O
results O
imply O
that O
the O
dampened O
inflammatory O
response O
in O
REGγ-deficient O
mice O
is O
closely O
related O
to O
changes O
in O
colon O
epithelial O
cells, O
leading O
to O
induction O
and O
progress O
of O
colitis. O
To O
distinguish O
between O
the O
contributions O
of O
haematopoietic O
and O
non-haematopoietic O
cells O
to O
colitis O
progression O
in O
REGγ O
mouse O

After O

months O
reconstitution O
phase O
to O
achieve O
near-complete O
reconstitution O
of O
the O
haematopoietic O
system, O

were O

bone O

(WT–WT O

showed O
similar O
susceptibility O
( O

and O
comparable O

( O

WT O

demonstrated O
significantly O
higher O
disease O
scores O
than O
REGγ-deficient O
recipients O
(WT–KO O
or O

Histological O
and O
immunological O
analysis O
( O

) O
also O
confirmed O
our O
observation O
that O
WT O

(WT–WT O

were O
more O
susceptible O
to O
DSS-induced O
colitis O
than O
REGγ O

These O

highly O

in O
Lao O

as O

as O

and O
it O
has O

turn O
to O

have O
been O
much O
sought O
after O
in O
the O
field O
of O
cancer, O

thus O
making O
this O
fungus O
widely O
used O
in O
alternative O
medicine O
over O
the O
world O
[ O
47 O
]. O
This O
high O
demand O
generated O
the O
necessity O
for O
large-scale O
cultivation O
[ O
48 O
], O
but O
in O
Lao O
PDR, O
this O
forest O
fungus O
is O
still O
collected O
from O
the O
wild O
in O
large O
quantities. O
Now O
becoming O
scarce, O
its O
retail O
market O
price O
is O
quite O
high. O

Though O
they O
stated O
that O
airS O
contains O
a O
Fe-S-cluster O
essential O
for O
oxygen O
sensing O
and O
is O
only O
active O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
oxygen O
in O

they O
found O
that O
the O
airR O
mutant O
only O
affects O
gene O
expression O
under O
anaerobic O
conditions O
in O
strain O
Newman O
[ O
22 O
]. O
In O
contrast, O
our O
results O
showed O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
cell O
wall O
metabolism-related O
genes O
was O
not O
changed O
under O
anaerobic O
conditions O
(Figure O

but O
only O
under O
aerobic O
conditions O
(Figure O
3 O
a,b,c). O
After O
further O
comparison O
of O
their O
microarray O
data O
with O
ours, O
we O
found O
that, O
cap O
operon, O
pbp1, O
and O
lytM O
were O
under O
negative O
control O
of O
AirR O
in O
their O
strain O
but O
positive O

in O
our O
strain; O
saeSR, O
agr, O
and O
RNAIII O
were O
under O
negative O

in O
their O

but O
not O
changed O
in O
our O

spa O

hlgC O
are O
under O
positive O
control O
of O
AirR O
in O
both O
strains O
(see O
Additional O

). O
The O
discrepancy O
may O
suggest O
that O
the O
regulatory O
activity O
of O
AirR O
is O
strain O
specific. O
Why O
AirSR O
acts O
differently O
in O
different O
strains O
is O
still O
not O
clear. O
Our O
speculation O
is O
that O
inactivation O
of O
sigma O
B O
in O
NCTC8325 O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
different O
activity O
of O
AirSR O
in O
NCTC8325 O
and O
Newman. O
But O
this O
speculation O
needs O
further O
study. O
WalKR O
is O
an O
important O
TCS O
that O
positively O
controls O
cell O
wall O

and O
turnover, O
including O
directly O
controlling O
lytM O
[ O

]. O
Alterations O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
WalKR O
as O
well O
as O
WalKR O
mutations O
at O
amino O

sequence O
can O
lead O
to O
a O
change O
in O
susceptibility O
to O
vancomycin O
[ O
19 O
, O
30 O
]. O
AirSR O
and O
WalKR O
exhibit O
similar O
functions. O
Our O
microarray O
data O
indicate O
that O
the O
WalKR O
expression O
level O
is O
unchanged O
in O
the O
airSR O
mutant, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
report O
so O
far O
that O
WalKR O
regulates O
AirSR, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
two O
TCSs O
may O
regulate O
cell O
wall O
biosynthesis O
independently. O
Conclusions O
The O
airSR O

exhibited O
reduced O

in O

Although O
this O

we O
feel O
that O
it O
further O
supports O
Culley's O
original O

demonstrating O
the O
importance O
of O

of O
the O

Although O
not O
presented O
here, O
we O
have O
preliminary O
data O
suggesting O
that O
earlier O
infection O
with O
RSV O
during O
neonatal O

(7 O

is O
sufficient O
to O
induce O
long-term O
functional O
consequences O
in O
the O
mouse O
even O
in O
the O
absence O
of O

In O
summary, O
the O
age O
of O
primary O
RSV O
infection O
has O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
determining O
disease O
outcome O
and O
suggests O
that O
immunity O
in O
weanling O
mice O
may O
have O
matured O
beyond O
the O

of O
the O

of O
weanling O
mice O
first O
exposed O
to O
Ova O
and O
then O
infected O

RSV O
(OOR O

revealed O
changes O
consistent O
with O
airway O

including O
subepithelial O

collagen O
deposition, O
smooth O

and O
mucus O

Histological O
changes O
observed O
in O
the O
ROO O
group O
were O
similar O
to O
mice O
receiving O

(OVA O

The O
amount O

positively O
correlated O
with O

with O

in O
the O

Our O
data O
(presented O
here O
and O
elsewhere[ O
20 O
]) O
along O
with O
the O
data O
of O
others[ O

suggest O
that O
eosinophils O
play O
a O
prominent O
role O
in O
orchestrating O
the O
local O
pulmonary O
immune O
responses O
and O
pathologies O
associated O
with O
allergic O

(i.e., O

It O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
if O
the O
specific O
loss O
of O
eosinophils O
leads O
to O
improvement O
of O
pulmonary O

and O

associated O

Although O

the O

(7 O
d O
vs. O

of O
the O
initial O

it O
did O
not O

these O

demonstrate O
the O

contribution O
of O
these O
T O

to O
pathophysiological O
events O
involved O
in O
airway O

associated O
with O
asthma. O
Recently, O
Dakhama O
and O
colleagues[ O
14 O
] O
demonstrated O
that O
indeed O
timing O
of O
initial O
infection O
was O
a O
critical O
factor O
in O
determining O
the O
airway O
response O
to O
subsequent O
RSV O
infection. O
However, O
other O
risk O
factors O
for O
the O
development O
of O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
and O
wheeze O
(i.e., O
asthma) O
in O
humans O
exist O
and O
the O
enhancement O
of O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
by O
RSV O
may O
be O
dependent O
on O
the O
individual's O
atopic O
background O
and O
current O
exposure O
to O
allergens O
or O
other O
environmental O
factors. O
Our O
hypothesis O
was O
that O
early O
exposure O
to O
RSV O
and O
allergen O
act O
synergistically O
to O
illicit O
inflammatory O
responses O
and O
long-term O
functional O
changes O
in O
the O
developing O
lung. O
We O
further O
hypothesized O
that O
these O
changes O
were O
the O
result O
of O
changes O
in O
airway O
structure O
(i.e., O
remodeling) O
and O
therefore, O
would O
compromise O
adult O
lung O
function. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
weanling O
mice O
were O
exposed O
to O
RSV O
and/or O
ovalbumin O
(Ova) O
to O
examine O
the O
effect O
of O
early O
exposures O
on O
pulmonary O
pathophysiology. O
We O
report O
that O
weanling O
mice O
infected O
with O
RSV O
then O
exposed, O
Ova O
fail O
to O
develop O
airway O
hyperreactivity O
(AHR) O
or O
long-term O
pathophysiologic O
changes, O
while O
weanling O
mice O
exposed O
first O
to O
Ova O
then O
infected O
with O
RSV O
developed O
increased O
AHR O
and O
long-term O
pulmonary O
pathologies. O
This O
increase O
in O
AHR O
was O
accompanied O
by O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
due O
to O
increased O
eosinophil O
and O
lymphocyte O
cell O
numbers, O
mucus O
cell O
hypertrophy, O
and O
enhanced O
mucus O
production. O
Intriguingly, O
the O
mice O
also O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
airway O
remodeling O
including O
subepithelial O
fibrosis. O

Activation O
of O
the O
innate O
immune O
system O
is O
a O
crucial O
step O
for O
the O
body O
when O
battling O
pathogens. O
However, O
when O
this O
activation O
becomes O
chronic, O
it O
can O
have O
detrimental O
effects. O
Microglia O
are O
the O
brain’s O
primary O
immune O
cells O
that O
are O
continually O
surveying O
their O
surroundings O
to O
release O
other O
inflammatory O
mediators O
or O
to O
phagocytose O
cells O
and O
protein O
aggregates O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Chronic O
microglial O
activation O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
neurodegeneration O
and O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O
dementia O
[ O
9 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
many O
of O
the O
risk O
factors O
for O
cognitive O
decline O
are O
associated O
with O
systemic O
inflammation, O
including O
obesity, O
hypertension, O
infection, O
cerebral O
infarction, O
smoking, O
and O
diabetes O
[ O
1 O
, O
10 O
– O
12 O
]. O
As O
a O
broad-spectrum O
protease, O
PLG O
has O
many O
physiological O
functions, O
and O
it O
is O
understood O
that O
PLG O
interacts O
with O
cell O
surfaces O
for O
many O
of O
these O
roles. O
PLG, O
considered O
a O
proinflammatory O
cell O
activator, O
is O
a O
potent O
chemoattractant O
for O
monocytes, O
macrophages, O
and O
dendritic O
cells O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
]. O
There O
is O
also O
evidence O
that O
PLG O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
innate O
immunity O
by O
regulating O
macrophage O
phagocytosis O
[ O
15 O
] O
and O
can O
affect O
inflammatory O
cell O
function O
through O
the O
production O
of O
cytokines, O
reactive O
oxygen O
species, O
and O
other O
inflammatory O
mediators O
[ O
16 O
]. O
Previous O
work O
in O
our O
lab O
has O
shown O
that O
PLG O
−/− O
mice O
have O
a O
decreased O
neuroimmune O
response O
following O
hippocampal O
injection O
of O
LPS O
[ O
17 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
however, O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
distinguish O
between O
the O
roles O
of O
brain- O
and O
liver-derived O
PLG O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
this O
response. O
We O
extended O
this O
study O
by O
using O
an O
ASO O
that O
specifically O
targets O
liver-produced O
PLG O
and O
found O
that O
it O
is O
plasma O
PLG O
that O
is O
crucial O
to O
regulating O
this O
response. O
Furthermore, O
we O
found O
that O
systemic O
challenge O
with O
LPS O
is O
sufficient O
to O
drive O
a O
neuroinflammatory O
response, O
and O
direct O
injection O
into O
the O
brain O
is O
not O
required. O
This O
situation O
better O
recapitulates O
what O
happens O
physiologically O
in O
the O
body O
in O
response O
to O
pathogens. O

Our O
results O
are O

in O
dampening O
NFκB O

attenuating O
the O

our O
data O
suggest O
that O
REGγ O
neutralizes O

To O

the O

we O
measured O
its O

We O
found O

in O

Consistently, O
stable O

resulted O
in O
an O

indicating O
a O
strong O
negative O

In O
the O

IκBɛ O
decayed O
much O
faster O

had O
a O
negative O
effect O
on O

( O

Given O
that O
the O

has O
been O
characterized O
as O

by O
the O

we O

how O

We O
utilized O

In O
contrast O
to O

we O

In O
terms O
of O
the O
origins O
and O
current O
distribution O
of O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
in O
eukaryotes O
we O
suggest O
that O
these O
genes O
were O
present O
in O
the O
last O
eukaryote O
common O
ancestor O
(LECA) O
that O
pre-dated O
the O
split O
into O
the O
major O
extant O
clades O
such O
as O
plants, O
fungi O
and O
Metazoa. O
The O
present O
distribution O
as O
reported O
here O
suggests O
that O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
were O
subsequently O
lost O
in O
all O
eukaryotic O
lineages O
except O
for O
the O
fungal O
and O
plant O
kingdoms. O
The O
presence O
of O
CLO/PXG O
orthologs O
in O
all O
plant O
genomes O
sequenced O
to O
date O
would O
suggest O
that O
these O
genes O
have O
important O
core O
housekeeping O
functions, O
especially O
in O
the O
land O
plants. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
more O
patchy O
distribution O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
amongst O
fungal O
species, O
where O
even O
inside O
many O
genera O
some O
species O
might O
contain O
the O
gene O
while O
others O
do O
not, O
suggests O
that O
CLO/PXG O
is O
more O
of O
an O
accessory O
gene O
in O
the O
fungi O
that O
may O
be O
beneficial O
to O
have O
in O
particular O
environments O
or O
niches. O
Conclusions O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
analysed O
the O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
family O
in O
the O
fungi O
and O
other O
non-plant O
clades. O
This O
complements O
our O
recent O
analysis O
of O
the O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
family O
in O
the O
Viridiplantae O
[ O

]. O
Whereas O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
are O
ubiquitous O
in O
the O
land O
plants O
(Streptophytes), O
they O
are O
only O
found O
in O
about O
30% O
of O
the O
sequenced O
fungal O
genomes O
that O
we O
were O
able O
to O
recover O
from O
public O
databases. O
However, O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
are O
present O
in O
all O
of O
the O
major O
fungal O
taxa, O
inferring O
that O
they O
have O
been O
selectively O
lost O
in O
some O
fungal O
lineages O
over O
the O
past O
one O
billion O
years O
of O
evolution. O
CLO/PXG-like O
genes O
were O
also O
present O
in O
only O
three O
out O
of O
the O
many O
hundreds O
of O
sequenced O
non-fungal O
Opisthokont O
genomes O
including O
an O
Amoebozoan, O
a O
Holozoan O
and O
a O
Metazoan, O
although O
whether O
the O
unusual O
presence O
of O
these O
genes O
is O
the O
result O
of O
HGT O
remains O
an O
open O
question. O

In O

Consequently, O

Under O

Implications O
of O
Relying O
on O
Online O
Samples O
Our O
survey O
pointed O
to O
a O
substantial O
reliance O
(around O
one-quarter O
of O
all O
samples) O
on O
online O
data O
collection. O
It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
internet O
offers O
a O
practical O
solution O
to O
reliance O
upon O
WEIRD O
samples O
(Gosling O
et O
al. O
2004 O
). O
Advantages O
of O
online O
sampling O
include O
cheap, O
quick O
and O
convenient O
access O
to O
participants O
who O
can O
often O
be O
recruited O
in O
larger O
numbers O
than O
are O
readily O
available O
for O
offline O
studies, O
and O
this O
ease O
of O
access O
to O
large O
online O
samples O
appears O
to O
be O
reflected O
in O
our O
analyses O
above. O
Indeed, O
online O
sampling O
can O
reach O
a O
greater O
diversity O
of O
participants, O
including O
some O
difficult-to-reach O
and O
under-represented O
populations O
(Andrews O
et O
al. O
2003 O
). O
Further, O
the O
anonymous O
setting O
of O
an O
online O
survey O
might O
arguably O
provoke O
more O
honest O
answers O
to O
questions O
on O
sensitive O
topics, O
compared O
with O
lab O
data O
collection O
(Joinson O
1999 O
). O
From O
another O
perspective O
though, O
internet O
sampling O
is O
limited O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
kinds O
of O
research O
tools O
that O
can O
be O
used, O
and O
in O
addition O
internet O
access O
itself O
is O
only O
available O
to O
a O
proportion O
of O
the O
population O
(and O
in O
some O
countries, O
a O
smaller O
proportion O
of O
the O
population O
than O
those O
who O
constitute O
undergraduate O
samples O
in O
other O
countries), O
meaning O
that O
the O
sample O
is O
still O
restricted O
(Gosling O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Researchers O
sometimes O
raise O
concerns O
that O
data O
collected O
via O
online O
sampling O
might O
be O
of O
lower O
quality O
than O
that O
collected O
using O
more O
traditional O
methods O
(e.g. O
Matzat O
and O
Snijders O
2010 O
; O
Paolacci O
and O
Chandler O
2014 O
). O
Online O
participants O
do O
not O
have O
easy O
access O
to O
the O
researcher O
to O
raise O
queries, O
might O
enter O
data O
carelessly O
or O
thoughtlessly, O
or O
might O
have O
chosen O
to O
enter O
data O
merely O
in O
order O
to O
view O
the O
study O
content O
(Aust O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Accordingly, O
to O
test O
the O
quality O
of O
online O
data O
collection, O
various O
studies O
have O
compared O
data O
collected O
online O
and O
offline O
and O
concluded O
that O
in O
many O
instances O
the O
two O
sampling O
methodologies O
give O
rise O
to O
very O
similar O
outcomes O
(Krantz O
and O
Dalal O
2000 O
). O

An O
alternative O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
severe O
RSV O
infections O
during O
infancy O
are O
a O
predisposing O
factor O
for O
the O
development O
of O
airway O
inflammatory O
disease O
states, O
such O
as O
asthma. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
RSV O
infection O
during O
infancy, O
when O
the O
immune O
system O
is O
still O
developing O
and O
is O
in O
a O
Th2-skewed O
state, O
initiates O
a O
Th2 O
polarized O
primary O
immune O
response O
and O
subsequently O
a O
Th2 O
polarized O
memory O
response O
to O
RSV O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Such O
a O
response O
may O
even O
be O
heightened O
in O
atopic O
individuals. O
Although O
compelling O
evidence O
in O
support O
of O
the O
later O
hypothesis O
comes O
from O
recently O
published O
data O
[ O
13 O
], O
we O
did O
not O
find O
evidence O
of O
this O
in O
our O
studies O
using O
weanling O
mice. O
It O
is O
important O
to O
point O
out O
that O
this O
may O
be O
due O
entirely O
to O
age O
at O
primary O
infection, O
since O
data O
from O
other O
labs[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
] O
and O
unpublished O
data O
from O
our O
laboratory O
demonstrate O
that O
infections O
at O
earlier O
time O
points O
(i.e., O
7 O
days O
post-partum) O
leads O
to O
long-term O
immune O
and O
pulmonary O
consequences O
for O
the O
host. O
Respiratory O
tract O
viral O
infections O
account O
for O
approximately O
85% O
of O
asthma O
exacerbations O
in O
children, O
and O
80% O
of O
those O
children O
have O
allergic O
asthma[ O
11 O
, O
38 O
, O
39 O
, O
42 O
, O
43 O
]; O
therefore, O
it O
is O
imperative O
that O
we O
understand O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
viral O
infections O
lead O
to O
asthma O
exacerbations. O
Although O
it O
remains O
unclear O
what O
is O
responsible O
for O
RSV-enhanced O
allergic O
inflammation O
in O
the O
lung, O
what O
is O
obvious O
is O
that O
AHR O
in O
RSV O
and O
Ova O
exposed O
mice O
does O
not O
correlate O
with O
RSV O
titer. O
In O
contrast, O
AHR O
does O
appear O
to O
correlate O
with O
increased O
pulmonary O
eosinophilia, O
lymphocyte O
cell O
numbers, O
a O
decrease O
in O
macrophage O
numbers, O
and O
most O
importantly O
pulmonary O
remodeling. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
exposure O
to O
allergens O
and O
RSV O
leads O
to O
increased O
structural O
changes O
in O
the O
conducting O
airways. O
And O
it O
is O
these O
structural O
changes O
in O
the O
developing O
lung O
that O
may O
be O
ultimately O
responsible O
for O
the O
progressive O
development O
of O
the O
chronic O
inflammatory O
disease O
state O
known O
as O
adult O
asthma. O

In O
the O
current O
study, O
we O

identify O

an O
important O
role O
in O

more O

that O
assumed O
that O
the O
results O

On O
the O

some O
research O
topics O
that O
will O
be O
familiar O

of O
this O

seem O
to O
be O
those O
for O
which O
we O
have O
good O
evidence O
of O
universality, O
and O
where O
a O

on O

is O
less O
problematic. O
Such O
topics O
can O
include O
emotional O

some O

Implications O

Student O
Samples O
We O
found O
that O
44% O
of O
the O

that O
we O
coded O
were O
student O
samples O
(137 O
out O
of O
311 O

The O
advantages O
of O
using O
student O
samples O
are O
similar O
to O
the O
advantages O
of O
using O
WEIRD O
samples, O
together O
with O
the O
additional O
advantages O
that O
student O

be O
comfortable O
within O
the O

and O

(Rosenthal O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
a O
reliance O
on O

may O
be O
particularly O
problematic O
when O

topics O

there O
is O
a O
clear O

A O
functional O
understanding O
of O
SB O
resistance O
has O
been O
largely O
developed O
in O
model O
plants O
such O
as O
tomato O
(Solanum O
lycopersicum O
L.) O
and O
Arabidopsis O
thaliana O
(L.) O
Heynh. O
In O
tomato, O
Yang O
et O
al. O
[ O
12 O
] O
mapped O
a O
single O
dominant O
locus O
in O
a O
260 O
Kb O
chromosomal O
region O
conferring O
resistance O
to O
SB O
(caused O
by O
S. O
lycopersici O
(Enjoji) O
W. O
Yamam.) O
and O
identified O
two O
putative O
resistance O
genes O
coding O
for O
a O
cysteine-rich O
receptor-like O
kinase O
(CRK) O
and O
a O
receptor-like O
kinase O
(RLK). O
This O
indicated O
that O
resistance O
in O
tomato O
was O
likely O
mediated O
via O
the O
recognition O
between O
plant O
and O
pathogen. O
In O
A. O
thaliana, O
Di O
et O
al. O
[ O
13 O
] O
reported O
that O
a O
gene O
encoding O
polygalactoronase-inhibiting O
protein O
(PGIP) O
was O
upregulated O
during O
the O
S. O
solani O
infection O
period. O
As O
PGIP O
belongs O
to O
a O
large O
family O
of O
leucine-rich O
repeat O
(LRR) O
proteins, O
it O
was O
suspected O
that O
a O
hypersensitive O
response O
(HR) O
may O
affect O
SB O
resistance O
in O
A. O
thaliana O
[ O
13 O
]. O
However, O
due O
to O
the O
highly O
complex O
nature O
of O
resistances O
to O
necrotrophic O
pathogens, O
it O
is O
still O
unknown O
if O
these O
mechanisms O
can O
be O
extended O
to O
other O
plant O
species. O
Therefore, O
a O
comprehensive O
molecular O
study O
of O
SB O
resistance O
in O
L. O
ervoides O
would O
not O
only O
benefit O
lentil O
breeding O
but O
also O
broaden O
our O
knowledge O
of O
SB O
resistance O
in O
systems O
other O
than O
model O
plant O
systems. O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
study O
of O
RNA O
has O
been O
significantly O
improved O
by O
the O
advancement O
in O
high-throughput O
next-generation O
sequencing O
techniques O
that O
generate O
massive O
amounts O
of O
data O
suitable O
for O
in-depth O
quantification O
of O
genome-wide O
gene O
expression O
across O
treatments, O
time O
points O
and O
genotypes O
[ O
14 O
]. O
In O
lentil, O
several O
RNA-sequencing O
(RNA-Seq) O
studies O
were O
performed O
to O
profile O
transcriptomes, O
develop O
molecular O
markers O
or O
investigate O
plant O
responses O
to O
various O
biotic O
and O
abiotic O
stresses O
[ O

The O
most O
important O
advance O
in O
this O
field O
was O
represented O
by O
recombinant O
gene O
technology O
which O
enabled O
the O
highly O
purified O

So O
the O
evolution O
in O
the O
manufacturing O
process O

recombinant O
factors O
during O
the O
last O
few O
years O
minimized O
the O

and O
improved O
the O
treatment O
and O
quality O

Three O

In O
addition, O
different O
viruses O
such O
as O
HTLV O

Afghanistan O
has O
a O
poor O
health O

and O
accurate O
HIV O

Thus, O
a O

HIV O
epidemic O
may O
soon O
ensue O
due O
increase O
in O
high-risk O
behavior O
and O
intravenous O

In O

in O
Kabul, O
Afghanistan, O
from O

the O

The O
high O

in O

indicates O
the O
very O
high O

The O

a O
severe O

a O
crucial O
role O

summary O
of O
our O
proposed O
mechanism O

summarized O
in O

Proposed O
mechanism O
of O
how O
PLG O
mediates O
the O
systemic O
inflammatory O
and O
neuroinflammatory O
response O
during O
an O
LPS O
challenge. O
(1) O
LPS O
injected O
IP O
gets O
into O
the O
bloodstream O
of O
mice. O
(2) O
Inflammatory O
signals O
in O
the O
blood O
lead O
to O
PLG O
cleavage O
into O
plasmin. O
(3) O
Plasmin, O
which O
mediates O
macrophage O
migration, O
acts O
on O
PLG-R O
KT O
receptors O
on O
PVMs. O
(4) O
PVMs O
release O
IL-1β O
and O
other O
cytokines O
and O
inflammatory O
mediators O
into O
the O
parenchyma O
of O
the O
brain O
which O
(5) O
causes O
activation O
of O
microglial O
cells O
Notably, O
our O
data O
also O
suggest O
that O
plasma O
PLG O
depletion O
may O
be O
an O
effective O
treatment O
for O
neuroinflammatory O
conditions. O
However, O
PLG O
deficiency O
is O
known O
to O
cause O
other O
disorders, O
such O
as O
conjunctivitis O
of O
the O
eye, O
woody O
deposits O
on O
the O
gums, O
and O
gingivitis, O
all O
of O
which O
are O
linked O
to O
the O
inability O
to O
clear O
fibrin O
[ O
16 O
]. O
Because O
PLG O
has O
many O
physiological O
functions O
in O
the O
body, O
it O
may O
be O
challenging O
to O
just O
target O
those O
linked O
to O
chemotaxis O
and O
immunity, O
and O
thus O
it O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
therapeutic O
target O
for O
neuroinflammatory O
disease. O
It O
may O
be O
most O
effective O
to O
target O
the O
PLG-R O
KT O
receptor O
to O
interfere O
with O
chemotaxis O
of O
immune O
cells O
like O
PVMs O
without O
affecting O
the O
overall O
PLG O
activity. O
The O
role O
PLG-R O
KT O
may O
play O
in O
modulating O
neuroinflammation O
merits O
further O
studies O
to O
validate O
it O
as O
an O
important O
clinical O
target. O
Conclusions O
The O
present O
study O
has O
shown O
that O
PLG O
is O
a O
key O
mediator O
of O
perivascular O
macrophage O
migration O
that O
plays O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
the O
communication O
of O
inflammatory O
signals O
between O
the O
periphery O
and O
the O
CNS. O

The O
network O
is O
highly O
congruent O
with O
the O
representative O
phylogeny O
(Fig. O
7 O
). O
Strongly O
supported O
clades O
found O
in O
the O
phylogeny O
can O
also O
be O
clearly O
seen O
in O
the O
network. O
However, O
there O
is O
a O
large O
degree O
of O
conflict O
regarding O
the O
sister O
group O
relationships O
amongst O
these O
clades O
as O
illustrated O
by O
the O
large O
number O
of O
alternative O
splits O
between O
clades O
(Additional O
file O
29 O
: O
Figure O
S6). O
Based, O
on O
both O
our O
phylogenetic O
and O
network O
analyses O
we O
suggest O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
confidently O
infer O
the O
true O
phylogenetic O
relationships O
amongst O
these O
proteins. O
A O
recent O
in O
silico O
analysis O
of O
the O
Mucoromycota O
species, O
Rhizophagus O
irregularis O
has O
suggested O
that O
this O
arbuscular O
mycorrhizal O
fungus O
has O
acquired O
19 O
genes O
via O
horizontal O
gene O
transfer O
from O
plants O
and O
bacteria O
[ O
69 O
]. O
One O
of O
these O
genes O
is O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
from O
a O
plant O
donor. O
Our O
phylogenetic O
analysis O
fails O
to O
confirm O
this O
finding. O
Firstly, O
other O
Mucoromycota O
species O
are O
grouped O
beside O
the O
R. O
irregularis O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
(Fig. O
7 O
). O
Therefore, O
if O
HGT O
did O
occur O
and O
R. O
irregularis O
contains O
a O
plant O
CLO/PXG O
ortholog, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
recent O
transfer O
into O
R. O
irregularis O
alone O
(Fig. O
7 O
&amp; O
Additional O
file O
28 O
: O
Figure O
S5). O
Secondly, O
the O
bootstrap O
supports O
and O
the O
network O
analysis O
grouping O
the O
basal O
fungi O
with O
the O
plants O
is O
very O
low O
(as O
described O
above). O
To O
infer O
that O
a O
HGT O
event O
has O
occurred, O
would O
mean O
that O
R. O
irregularis O
and O
indeed O
the O
ancestor O
of O
other O
basal O
fungi O
lost O
the O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
ortholog O
and O
acquired O
the O
plant O
copy O
instead, O
meanwhile O
Dikarya O
species O
retained O
a O
fungal O
ortholog. O
This O
scenario O
is O
most O
un-parsimonious, O
what O
is O
more O
likely O
is O
that O
the O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
was O
present O
in O
the O
last O
eukaryote O
common O
ancestor O
(LECA) O
and O
was O
subsequently O
lost O
in O
all O
lineages O
except O
for O
the O
fungal O
and O
plant O
kingdoms. O

According O
to O
the O

According O

the O

Thus, O

φAbp2 O
The O
life O
cycle O
of O
φAbp2 O
was O
investigated O
by O
performing O
a O
one-step O
growth O
experiment. O
The O
duration O
of O
the O
latent O
period O
was O
short O
(~ O
15 O
min O
at O
37 O
°C) O
and O
was O
followed O
by O
a O

period O
that O
lasted O
50 O
min. O
The O
burst O
size O
was O
222 O
phage O
particles O
per O
infected O
cell O
after O
100 O
min O
(Supplementary O

Moreover, O
φAbp2 O
was O
stable O
at O
temperatures O
ranging O
from O
-80 O
to O
20 O
°C. O
However, O
the O
viral O
titres O
decreased O
slightly O
at O
40 O
°C O
and O
were O
reduced O
dramatically O
at O
60 O
and O
80 O
°C O
(Supplementary O
Fig O

In O
addition, O
the O
pH O
tolerance O
of O
φAbp2 O
was O
stable O
over O
a O
broad O
range O
(from O
5.0–10.0). O
However, O
the O
titre O
dropped O
significantly O
at O
pH O
4.0 O
and O
pH O
11.0 O
(Supplementary O

The O
mean O
monthly O
direct O
UTI O
costs O
were O
estimated O
at O
£30.60 O
when O
the O
UTIs O
were O
treated O
with O
empirical O
antibiotic O
therapy O
and O
£37.10 O
when O
urine O
cultures O
were O
performed O
[ O

]. O
The O
cost O
differences O
between O
this O
study O
and O
the O
present O
French O
study O
may O
have O
been O
related O
to O
the O
systematic O
one-month O
follow-up O
(with O
no O
differences O
between O
relapse O
and O
reinfection) O
used O
in O
the O
English O
study O
and O
the O
higher O
remuneration O
of O
English O
GPs O
(approximately O
30 O
% O
greater O
than O
that O
of O
French O
GPs O
in O
2008 O
[ O

]). O
In O
the O
United O
States O
in O
2010, O
the O
annual O
direct O
and O
indirect O
UTI O
cost O
was O
estimated O
at O
$2.3 O
billion O
[ O
47 O
]. O
Considering O
that O
the O
American O
population O
was O
approximately O
five O
times O
greater O
than O
the O
French O
population O
in O
2012, O
the O
American O
cost O
was O
six O
times O
greater O
than O
the O
French O
cost. O
This O
difference O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
costs O
of O
physician O
visits O
and O
diagnostic O
tests, O
which O
are O
three O
to O
ten O
times O
more O
expensive O
in O
the O
United O
States O
than O
in O
France O
[ O
48 O
]. O
Cost-effectiveness O
studies O
have O
found O
that O
most O
cost-effective O
treatment O
is O
the O
empirical O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
that O
are O
effective O
against O
E. O
coli O
[ O
12 O
, O
49 O
, O
50 O

Furthermore, O
in O
the O
present O
French O
study, O
the O
mean O
UTI O
cost O
due O
to O
wild O
E. O

was O
not O
significantly O
different O
from O
the O
mean O
UTI O
cost O
due O
to O
antibiotic-resistant O
E. O
coli. O
This O
lack O
of O
a O
difference O
could O
have O
resulted O
from O
our O
use O
of O
systematic O
urine O
analyses. O
Even O
without O
antibiotics, O
20 O
% O
of O
women O
recover O
from O
uncomplicated O
lower O
UTIs O
within O
3 O
days O
and O
26 O
% O
recover O
within O
one O
week O
[ O
41 O
, O
51 O
]. O
The O
effect O
of O
inadequate O
antibiotic O
prescription O
should O
be O
studied O
in O
greater O
detail O
and O
might O
have O
little O
influence O
on O
the O
consumption O
of O

by O
women O
who O
visit O
GPs O
for O
UTIs. O
Approximately O
one O
quarter O
of O
the O
suspected O
UTIs O

though O
peritonitis O

already O
occurred. O
Furthermore, O
she O
developed O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
concurrently O
in O
both O
arms O
which O
were O
apart O
from O
each O
other. O
It O
seems O
questionable O
if O
the O
bacteria O
involved O
in O
the O
fasciitis O
invaded O

the O

Additionally, O
this O
S. O
pyogenes O
lineage O
comprised O
emm89-type O
strains O
and O
carried O
a O
mutation O
in O
covS O
gene. O
This O
group O
produces O
many O
surface-bound O
and O
extracellular O
virulence O
factors O
that O
contribute O
to O
pathogenesis O
in O
complex O
ways. O
CovS/CovR O
is O
a O
key O
two-component O
regulatory O
system O
of O
gene O
transcription O
in O
S. O
pyogenes O
[ O
12 O
– O
14 O
]. O
CovS/CovR O
regulates O
the O
expression O
of O
15% O
of O
the O
genes O
of O
S. O
pyogenes O
[ O
15 O
, O
16 O
], O
including O
streptococcal O
pyrogenic O
exotoxin O
B O
(SpeB). O
Because O
the O
expression O
of O
active O
SpeB O
causes O
the O
degradation O
of O
secreted O
GAS O
(group O
A O
streptococci) O
proteins, O
including O
several O
virulence O
factors, O
reduced O
SpeB O
expression O
in O
covS O
mutants O
confers O
strong O
virulence O
on O
S. O
pyogenes O
[ O
17 O
, O
18 O
]. O
Recent O
studies O
have O
also O
described O
an O
inverse O
relationship O
between O
disease O
severity O
and O
the O
degree O
of O
a O
cysteine O
protease, O
SpeB O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
]. O
Moreover, O
a O
previous O
report O
has O
suggested O
that O
mutated O
covS O
plays O
important O
roles O
in O
the O
in O
vivo O
dissemination O
of O
S. O
pyogenes O
in O
humans O
from O
the O
upper O
respiratory O
tract O
to O
aseptic O
tissues, O
such O
as O
blood O
and O
cerebrospinal O

[ O

and O
some O
studies O
have O
described O
the O
significance O
of O
covS O
mutations O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
STSS O
[ O
20 O
, O
21 O
]. O
In O
this O
case, O
it O
was O
considered O
that O
this O
covS O
mutation O
contributed O
to O
the O
development O
of O
peritonitis O
in O
a O
previously O
healthy O
patient. O

Infection O
with O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
also O
reduces O

Some O
tick-borne O
pathogens, O
such O
as O
Borrelia O
burgdorferi O
(sensu O
lato) O
and O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
have O
a O
high O
genetic O
diversity. O
Due O
to O
the O
high O
genetic O
diversity, O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
was O
formerly O
even O
split O
in O
three O
different O
species O
[ O
12 O
]. O
This O
genetic O
diversity O
has O
probably O
arisen O
as O
a O
response O
to O
evasion O
of O
immune O

of O
phylogenetically O

Elucidating O
the O

the O

We O

based O
on O

following O
Jahfari O

Ecotype B-PATH
I I-PATH
based O
on O
this O

is O
linked O
to O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
mammals O
including O
red O

(Cervus O

livestock O
and O
humans, O
whereas O
ecotype O
II O
is O
linked O
mainly O
to O
roe O
deer O
(Capreolus O
capreolus). O
Both O
ecotypes O
are O
most O
probably O
vectored O
by O
I. O
ricinus. O
Ecotype O
III O
is O
associated O
with O
small O
mammals O
and O
expected O
to O
be O
vectored O
by O
Ixodes O
trianguliceps O
[ O

while O
ecotype O
IV O
is O
linked O
to O
birds O
and O
potentially O
vectored O
by O
I. O
frontalis O
[ O
15 O
]. O
In O
support O
of O
this O
scheme, O
the O
ecotype O
II O
found O
in O
roe O

was O
for O

not O
the O
one O
found O
in O
livestock O
in O

Some O
of O
these O
genes O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
difference O
in O
the O
level O
of O

between O
the O
two O
RILs. O
According O
to O
the O
expression O

and O

of O
these O

we O
found O
that O
LR-66-637 O

In O

Yang O

[ O

studied O
the O

found O
that O
several O
GO O

‘localization’, O

and O
‘molecular O

were O
activated O
in O
the O

tomato O

proposing O
that O
the O
upregulation O
of O
these O
activities O
were O
related O
to O
S. O

Carbohydrates O

are O
considered O
essential O
parts O

Theoretically, O
the O

One O

was O
the O

Discussion O
In O
the O
current O
study, O
we O
used O
the O
definition O
proposed O
by O
Friedman O
et O
al. O
[ O
2 O
] O
to O
define O
healthcare-associated O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections, O
and O
we O
found O
that O
HCA O
infections O
accounted O
for O
over O
half O
of O
the O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections. O
HCA O
infections O
showed O
similar O
clinical O
features O
with O
nosocomial O
infections. O
CA O
infections O
presented O
different O
characteristic O
from O
both O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
infections. O
Hematological O
malignancy O
was O
more O
commonly O
related O
to O
nosocomial O
infections, O
whereas O
diabetes O
mellitus O
was O
more O
frequently O
associated O
with O
CA O
infections. O
These O
findings O
were O
also O
observed O
in O
previous O
reports O
from O
Taiwan O
and O
Korea O
[ O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
cancer O
was O
more O
commonly O
associated O
with O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
bacteremia O
patients O
than O
CA O
bacteremia O
patients O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
, O
25 O
]. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
however, O
cerebral O
vascular O
disease O
and O
hypertension O
were O
more O
associated O
with O
HCA O
infections O
compared O
to O
CA O
infections. O
This O
discrepancy O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
regional O
differences O
in O
underlying O
diseases. O
Indeed, O
cerebral O
vascular O
disease O
and O
hypertension O
are O
epidemics O
in O
Chinese O
communities O
[ O
26 O
, O
27 O
]. O
Patients O
with O
these O
diseases O
have O
a O
greater O
demand O
for O
medical O
care O
services. O
In O
this O
study, O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
rates O
were O
similar O
for O
patients O
with O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
infections O
and O
both O
patients O
exhibited O
significantly O
higher O
30-day O
mortality O
rates O
than O
CA O
infection O
patients. O
These O
results O
were O
similar O
to O
other O
studies O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
] O
and O
may O
largely O
be O
due O
to O
the O
variation O
in O
underlying O
diseases O
between O
the O
three O
groups, O
which O
are O
classical O
risk O
factors O
for O
prognosis O
of O
infectious O
diseases. O
An O
important O
finding O
in O
this O
study O
was O
that O
HCA O
K. O
pneumoniae O
strains O
exhibited O
similar O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
patterns O
with O
nosocomial O
strains, O
and O
both O
the O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
strains O
were O
significantly O
more O
resistant O
than O
the O
CA O
strains. O
This O
observation O
indicates O
that O
clinicians O
should O
consider O
similar O
empirical O
therapy O
for O
patients O
with O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections. O

Disease O
tolerance O
does O
not O
exert O
a O
direct O
negative O
effect O
on O
the O
host O
viral O

and O
depends O
on O
tissue O
damage O
control O
mechanisms O
which O
also O
regulated O
by O
innate O
and O
adaptive O
components O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
[ O
80 O
, O
81 O
]. O
The O
activation O
of O
IFN O
signaling O
can O
not O
only O
inhibit O
viral O
replication O
and O
release O
[ O
82 O
– O
84 O
], O
but O
also O
activate O
lymphocytes, O
natural O
killer O
(NK) O
cells, O
and O
macrophages O
[ O
85 O
]. O
IFN O
is O
believed O
acting O
as O
the O
bridge O
between O
innate O
and O
adaptive O
immunity O
[ O
86 O
, O
87 O
]. O
The O
activation O
of O
both O
innate O
immune O
system O
and O
adaptive O
immune O
system O
might O
be O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
highest O
resistant O
ability O
of O
clone O
H. O
Interestingly, O
the O
survivors O
of O
moderately O
resistant O
clone O
F O
kept O
the O
activation O
of O
innate O
immune O
system O
but O
the O
impaired O
adaptive O
immune O
system O
(Table O
3 O
; O
Additional O
file O
8 O
: O
Table O
S6). O
This O
similar O
pattern O
of O
immune O
response O
was O
also O
been O
found O
in O
gilthead O
seabream O
(Sparus O
aurata O
L.) O
infected O
with O
lymphocystis O
disease O
virus O
(LCDV) O
[ O
88 O
]. O
Among O
the O
top O
30 O
pathways O
enriched O
by O
DEUs O
specifically O
up-regulated O
their O
expression O
levels O
in O
the O
survivors O
of O
clone O
F, O
two-thirds O
of O
pathways O
belonged O
to O
“metabolism” O
or O
“biogenesis” O
(Fig. O
3e O
) O
which O
suggested O
that O
clone O
F O
might O
actively O
repair O
the O
impairment, O
including O
adaptive O
immune O
system. O
Along O
with O
the O
divergence O
of O
cyclostomes O
and O
cartilaginous O
fish, O
adaptive O
immunity O
emerged O
in O
vertebrate O
around O
450 O
million O
years O
ago O
[ O
89 O
, O
90 O
]. O
However, O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
innate O
immunity O
plays O
the O
dominant O
role O
in O
resistance O
to O
viral O
infection O
in O
teleost, O
due O
to O
the O
highly O
specialized O
immune O
responses O
(which O
means O
limited O
recognition O
of O
pathogens), O
low O
antibody O
affinity, O
slow O
antibody O
response, O
and O
weak O
memory O
response O
in O
fish O
adaptive O
immunity O
[ O
39 O
, O
71 O
, O
91 O
]. O
Therefore, O
the O
clone O
F O
showed O
moderate O
resistant O
ability O
to O
CaHV, O
which O
is O
weaker O
than O
that O
of O
clone O
H O
(IFN O
system O
genes O
and O
Ig O
genes O
both O
up-regulated O
their O
expression) O
and O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
clone O
A O
+ O
(IFN O
system O
genes O
down-regulated O
and O
Ig O
genes O
up-regulated O
their O
expression). O

In O
the O

of O
surrogate O

from O
Spinacea O

CYP124A1, O
CYP142A1, O
and O
CYP125A1 O
oxidized O
the O

This O

a O

for O
the O
entry O
of O

into O
the O
β-oxidation O
pathway O
(Johnston O

). O
However, O
this O
sequential O

was O
not O
seen O
when O
several O

redox O
partners O
were O
used O
to O
reconstitute O
the O
system O
(Ortega O
Ugalde O
et O

). O
CYP125A1 O
is O
the O
most O
efficient O
catalyst, O
followed O
by O
CYP142A1 O
and O
finally O
CYP124A1 O
(Johnston O

Utilization O

In O

We O
also O
hypothesize O
that O
B. O

plays O
similar O
roles O
in O
the O
emancipation O

as O
that O
of O

In O

VitB6 O

Moreover, O
a O

may O
be O
responsive O

These O
results O
indicate O
that O
expression O
of O
VitB6 O
biosynthetic O
genes O
in O
tomato O
down-regulated O
after O
infection O
with O
XCV O
and O
hence O
reduced O
VitB6 O

might O
be O
a O
natural O
response O

as O

Previous O

thatVitB6 O

When O
compared O
with O
those O
in O

plants, O
increased O
disease O

and O
increased O
accumulation O
of O
SOD O
after O
infection O
with O
XCV O
was O
observed. O
The O

of O
SOD O
activity O
accelerated O
enzymatic O
conversion O
of O
the O

and O
led O
to O
further O

in O
the O

Hence, O
increased O
accumulation O

will O
lead O
to O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
exploring O
the O
possible O
mechanisms O
of O
microbiota-mediated O
modulation O
of O
anti-tumor O
immunity, O
two O
general O
questions O
arise. O
First, O
what O
is O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
messenger, O
which O
delivers O
a O
signal O
from O
the O
GI O
tract O
to O
the O
tumor O
and/or O
tumor-draining O
lymph O
node O
(TdLN)? O
Such O
a O
messenger O
would O
be O
able O
to O
enter O
the O
circulation O
in O
order O
to O
access O
the O
distant O
tumor O
site O
and O
can O
be O
classified O
as O
microbiota- O
or O
host-derived O
cell O
(live O
microbes O
or O
host O
immune O
cells) O
or O
molecule O
(MAMP/PAMP, O
microbial O
metabolite, O
or O
host O
cytokine). O
The O
second O
question O
is O
what O
is O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
immune O
effect O
that O
the O
messenger O
confers O
within O
the O
tumor? O
An O
immunosuppressive O
effect O
could O
be O
achieved O
by O
augmenting O
regulatory O
functions O
(Tregs, O
MDSCs, O
tumor-associated O
macrophages) O
or O
directly O
inhibiting O
anti-tumor O
immunity; O
an O
immunostimulatory O
effect O
could O
be O
achieved O
by O
alleviating O
regulatory O
functions O
or O
stimulating O
anti-tumor O
T O
cell O
responses O
(via O
antigenicity, O
adjuvanticity O
or O
bystander O
activation). O
The O
exact O
mechanisms O
of O
microbiota-mediated O
effects O
on O
tumor O
growth O
and O
efficacy O
of O
immunotherapy O
are O
only O
beginning O
to O
be O
understood. O
Figure O

summarizes O
these O
hypothetical O
scenarios O
and O
early O
evidence O
is O
discussed O
below. O

(2) O

that O
there O

many O

in O
the O

species, O
and O
somewhat O

in O

Interestingly, O

two O

from O
the O

Mitosporidium O

Since O
it O

that O

normally O
a O

and O
occurs O
more O

Discussion O
Micromussa O
amakusensis O
has O
been O
documented O
widely O
from O
the O
Indo-Pacific, O
but O
is O
poorly O
studied O
and O
considered O
globally O
rare O
(Arrigoni O
et O
al. O
2016a O
; O
Veron O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
The O
species O
was O
first O
recorded O
in O
western O
Thailand, O
Tanegashima O
Island O
and O
mainland O
Japan O
(including O
Amakusa O
Island O
after O
which O
the O
species O
was O
named), O
and O
Vanuatu O
(Veron O
1990 O
). O

In O
addition O
to O
their O
associations O
with O
bilayer O
membranes O
in O
cells, O
many O
CLO/PXG O
isoforms O
are O
also O
able O
to O
bind O
in O
a O
highly O
stable O
fashion O
to O
the O
phospholipid O
monolayer O
membrane O
that O
surrounds O
intracellular O
lipid O
droplets O
(LDs). O
The O
LD O
binding O
may O
be O
mediated O
by O
the O
relatively O
hydrophobic O
motif O
that O
is O
normally O
described O
as O
a O
transmembrane O
domain O
(see O
above), O
although O
such O
binding O
would O
require O
that O
the O
normally O
linear O
α-helical O
region O
could O
also O
assume O
a O
U-shape O
so O
that O
it O
could O
loop O
into O
and O
out O
of O
the O
LD O
monolayer O
[ O

It O
has O
been O
proposed O
that O
the O
U-shape O
conformation O
of O
the O
lipid O
binding O
site O
when O
interacting O
with O
LDs O
is O
mediated O
by O
a O

well-conserved O

motif O
that O
is O
similar O
to O
the O

[ O

are O
now O
being O
considered O
as O
alternatives O

a O

[ O

In O

Indeed, O

Thus, O
bacteriophage O

is O
a O
potential O
strategy O
to O

However, O
problems O

Background O
Systemic O

a O
role O
in O
the O
development O

However, O
exactly O
how O
systemic O

influence O
the O
neuroimmune O

either O
directly O
or O
indirectly, O
is O
not O
well O
understood. O
Communication O
of O
the O

by O
the O

Recent O
results O
from O
the O
Atherosclerosis O

which O
included O
over O
12,000 O

suggest O
that O
systemic O

is O
predictive O
of O
20-year O
cognitive O

Individuals O
with O
the O

had O
the O
steepest O
cognitive O
decline O
in O
the O
20-year O
period O
analyzed, O
especially O
in O

suggesting O
that O

may O
be O
a O
driver O
of O

[ O

LPS O
is O
a O
gram-negative O
bacterial O

which O
is O
expressed O
on O

[ O

]. O
LPS O
is O
a O
good O
model O
to O
study O
the O
connection O
between O
peripheral O
and O
central O
immune O
responses; O
when O
injected O
systemically, O
LPS O
leads O
to O
the O
activation O

the O
major O
immune O
cells O
of O
the O
brain, O
which O
then O
release O
proinflammatory O

Plasminogen O
(PLG) O
and O
its O

[ O

Using O
a O
mouse O

(AD), O
we O
recently O
showed O
that O
plasma O
PLG O

is O
protective O
against O

pathology O
and O
drastically O
decreases O
the O
brain’s O
innate O

We O
also O
showed O
that O
driving O

exacerbates O
this O

Our O

that O

Gas O

on O

conditions, O
which O
could O
be O
different O

mainly O
in O

(Fig. O

Microarray O

indicate O
that O
several O
photosynthetic O

repressed O
by O
wounding O
in O
A. O
thaliana, O
probably O
via O
ethylene/ethylene-responsive O

(Delessert O

observed O
in O
all O

Several O
other O
studies O
regarding O
the O
impact O

have O
indicated O
that O

(Quilliam O

However, O
these O
naturally O

Moreover, O

been O

in O
the O

of O

from O
both O
the O

implying O
that O
most O

the O

to O
be O

currently O
associated O

This O
study O
was O
undertaken O
to O
identify O
and O
examine O
when O
during O
its O
emergence O
Y. B-PATH
pestis I-PATH
gained O
the O
ability O
to O
cause O
severe O
primary O
pneumonic O
plague. O
By O
utilizing O
the O
deeply O
rooted, O
ancestral O
Pestoides O
and O
Angola O
lineages, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
specific O
microevolutionary O
event O
of O
pPCP1/Pla O
acquisition O
contributed O
directly O
to O
the O
adaptation O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
to O
the O
respiratory O
environment, O
and O
no O
additional O
genetic O
changes O
were O
necessary O
to O
cause O
pneumonic O
plague. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
our O
results O
indicate O
that O
the O
T259 O
modification O
of O
the O
Pla O
protease O
enhanced O
systemic O
disease, O
suggesting O
that O
Y. O
pestis O
was O
primed O
to O
cause O
a O
fulminant O
pneumonia O
before O
its O
ability O
to O
efficiently O
cause O
invasive O
infections. O
Finally, O
we O
propose O
that O
the O
I259T O
substitution O
of O
Pla O
may O
have O
been O
one O
of O
the O
defining O

that O

Similarly, O
folkbiological O
reasoning O
develops O
differently O
in O
rural O

Further, O

also O
now O
shown O
significant O
differences O
between O
the O
original O
data O
collected O
from O
western O
cultures O
and O
data O
collected O
later O
among O
more O
diverse O
cultures. O
In O
each O
case, O
theories O
were O
initially O
developed O
that O
assumed O
that O
the O
results O
from O
cultures O
more O
familiar O
to O
the O
researchers O
were O
universal. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
some O
research O
topics O
that O
will O
be O
familiar O
to O
readers O
of O
this O
journal O
seem O
to O
be O
those O
for O
which O
we O
have O
good O
evidence O
of O
universality, O
and O
where O
a O
reliance O
on O
less O
diverse O
samples O
is O
less O
problematic. O
Such O
topics O
can O
include O
emotional O
expression O
and O
pride O
displays, O
false O
belief O
tasks, O
some O
mate O
preferences, O
personality O
structure, O
psychological O
essentialism, O
punishment O
of O

and O
social O

(Henrich O

Implications O
of O
Relying O
on O
Student O
Samples O
We O
found O
that O
44% O
of O
the O
samples O
that O
we O
coded O
were O
student O
samples O
(137 O
out O
of O
311 O
samples). O
The O
advantages O
of O
using O
student O
samples O
are O
similar O
to O
the O
advantages O
of O
using O
WEIRD O
samples, O
together O
with O
the O
additional O
advantages O
that O
student O
participants O
should O
be O
comfortable O
within O
the O
university O
setting O
and O
accustomed O
to O
following O
task O
instructions O
(Rosenthal O
1965 O
). O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
a O
reliance O
on O
student O
samples O
may O
be O
particularly O
problematic O
when O
dealing O
with O
topics O
where O
there O
is O
a O
clear O
impact O
of O
the O
variables O
that O
distinguish O
students O
from O
the O
general O
population. O
These O
may O
include O
broad O
variables O
such O
as O
age, O
experience, O
socio-economic O
background O
and O
educational O
level, O
as O
well O
as O
more O
specific O
tendencies O
including O
students’ O
greater O
level O
of O
cognitive O
ability O
and O
obedience O
to O
authority, O
more O
transient O
friendships O
and O
still O
nascent O
attitudes O
and O
sense O
of O
self O
(Sears O
1986 O
). O
Areas O
that O
have O
received O
specific O
criticism O
due O
to O
their O
reliance O
on O
student O
sampling O
include O
research O
on O
economic O
decision O
making O
(Levitt O
and O
List O
2007 O
), O
socio-political O
attitudes O
(Schultz O

the O

prejudice O
(Henry O

and O
industrial O
and O

psychology O
(Bergman O

Effect O

not O
merely O
in O

also O
in O

(Peterson O

the O
ability O
of O

simultaneously O
analyze O
diverse O

The O

been O
extensively O

In O
this O

we O

and O
further O
demonstrated O
the O

PPP, O
fatty-acid O

In O
line, O
Rhabdias O
ranae O
seems O
not O
capable O
to O
infect O
caudates O
and O
to O
be O
restricted O
to O
frogs/toads O
as O
suitable O
hosts, O
but O
in O
the O
past O
two O
decades, O
first O
Rhabdias O
infections O
in O
caudates O
have O
been O
reported O
(Kuzmin O
et O

2001 O
; O
Kuzmin O
et O
al. O
2003 O
; O
Eisenberg O
and O
Pantchev O
2009 O
). O
Therefore, O
it O
seems O
assumable O
that O
anurans O
might O
be O
more O
often O
infected O
with O
Rhabdias O
than O
caudates, O
especially O
because O
the O
correlation O
was O
rather O
high O
(r O
= O
0.44) O
when O
comparing O
these O
two O
amphibian O
groups O
(Cohen O
1988 O
). O
Clinical O
relevance O
of O
rhabdiosis O
was O
also O
underlined O
in O
dissections, O
since O
in O
one O
adult O
male O
Australian O

(L. O
caerulea), O
a O
Rhabdias O
spp.-infected O
lung O
was O
found O
and O
which O
might O
have O
caused O
severe O
pneumonia, O
hepatitis, O
and O
nephritis. O
Nonetheless, O
other O
pathogens O
could O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
as O
the O

infections O
with O
Chryseobacterium O
indologenes O

and O

isolated O
from O
the O

coeloma. O
Alongside O
Rhabdias, O
other O
nematode O
genus, O
i.e., O
Oswaldocruzia, O
was O
frequently O
diagnosed O
(2.8%) O
in O

diagnosed O
in O
an O

these O

a O
matter O

In O

of O
their O
widespread O
designations O

either O
caleosins O
(CLO) O

peroxygenases O

we O
refer O

In O
both O

CLO/PXG O

have O
been O

Several O
different O
types O
of O
lipid O
peroxygenase O

are O
catalysed O
by O
both O
fungal O
and O
plant O
CLO/PXGs O

in O
all O
cases O
these O

require O
the O

that O
are O
coordinated O
by O
two O
invariant O
histidine O
residues O
[ O
3 O
, O
18 O
– O

]. O
Lipid O
peroxygenases O
such O
as O
CLO/PXG O
play O
key O
roles O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
oxylipins, O
which O
are O
a O
large O
family O

both O

The O

typically O
of O

25–30 O

[ O

CLO/PXG O

one O

proximal O
to O
the O

[ O

Taken O
together O
these O
are O
the O
diagnostic O
features O
that O
make O
up O
the O
canonical O
motifs O
used O
to O
classify O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
in O
databases. O
An O
important O
structural O
feature O
of O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
is O
the O
presence O
of O
one O
or O
more O
lipid-binding O
sites, O
the O
most O
conserved O
of O
which O
is O
located O
immediately O
adjacent O
to O
the O
calcium-binding, O
EF O
hand O

[ O

Among O
the O
bacteria O
that O
do O
metabolize O
prebiotic O
oligosaccharides O
are O
some O
strains O
of O
Lactobacillus O
and O
Bifidobacterium O
spp., O
and O
numerous O
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
their O
growth O
is O
stimulated O
by O
FOS O
or O
other O
oligosaccharides. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
comparing O
with O
the O
control O
strains O
used O
by O
us, O
isolated O
from O
the O
human O
gastrointestinal O
tract, O
IBB3423 O
does O
not O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
ferment O
l O
-rhamnose, O
dulcitol, O
inositol, O
and O
l O
-fucose, O
probably O
due O
to O
their O
low O
abundance O
in O
cow O
milk. O
Interestingly, O
an O
in O
silico O
analysis O
has O
identified O
a O
complete O
myo-inositol O
(MI) O
utilization O
operon O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
the O
probiotic O
L. O
casei O
BL23 B-PATH
strain O
(Yebra O
et O
al. O
2007 O
), O
but O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
non-functional. O
Inositol, O
a O
sugar O
alcohol O
found, O
among O
other O
sources, O
in O
soil, O
is O
used O
for O
phosphate O
storage O
in O
plants, O
but O
is O
rarely O
used O
as O
an O
energy O
source O
by O
LAB O
(Yebra O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
So O
far, O
only O
some O
strains O
of O
L. O
casei O
have O
been O
found O
to O
metabolize O
MI O
with O
poor O
efficiency. O
One O
should O
note O
that O
even O
the O
presence O
of O
genes O
encoding O
enzymes O
for O
MI O
metabolism O
may O
not O
be O
sufficient O
to O
confer O
an O
ability O
to O
utilize O
MI O
(Zhang O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Vinay-Lara O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
Moreover, O
we O
identified O
glgBCDAP-amyB O
genes O
connected O
with O
glycogen O
metabolism O
(LCAKO_2211 O
to O
LCAKO_2216) O
organized O
identically O
to O
operons O
of O
other O
Lactobacillus O
species O
(Goh O
and O
Klaenhammer O
2014 O
). O
It O
remains O
to O
be O
determined O
why O
IBB3423 O
cannot O
utilize O
glycogen O
despite O
having O
the O
relevant O
genes. O
Several O
reasons O
could O
be O
at O
play, O
including O
a O
lack O
of O
expression O
of O
these O
genes O
or O
their O
mutation. O

The O
major O
group O
of O
enzymes O
responsible O
for O
the O
degradation O
of O
exogenous O
or O
endogenous O
antigens O
is O
mostly O
the O
protease. O
Among O
them, O
the O
best O
known O
and O
well O
characterized O
are O
cysteine O
cathepsins. O
Cathepsins O
are O
essential O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
protein O
degradation, O
and O
extracellular O
matrix O
remodeling O
in O
all O
cell O
types O
and O
tissues O
[ O
4 O
]. O
They O
are O
produced O
as O
inactive O
enzymes O
(zymogenes) O
within O
the O
lysosomes. O
Cathepsins O
undergo O
activation O
by O
autocatalysis O
due O
to O
low O
pH O
or O
they O
are O
activated O
by O
other O
proteases, O
such O
as O
pepsin O
and O
cathepsin O
D O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Cysteine O
cathepsins O
are O
present O
and O
active O
in O
lysosomes, O
nucleus, O
cytoplasm O
and O
cell O
membrane O
[ O
6 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
cathepsins O
are O
also O
present O
in O
the O
extracellular O
space O
and O
secretory O
vesicles O
of O
some O
cells, O
not O
only O
as O
zymogens, O
but O
also O
as O
active O
proteases O
[ O
7 O
]. O
It O
appears O
that O
besides O
the O
role O
of O
cysteine O
cathepsins O
in O
antigen O
processing, O
they O
also O
participate O
in O
cell O
entry O
of O
many O
types O
of O
viruses, O
including O
Ebola O
virus O
(EBOV) O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
], O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
(HIV) O
[ O
10 O
, O
11 O
] O
and O
reoviruses O
[ O
12 O
, O
13 O
]. O
However, O
the O
exact O
role O
of O
cathepsins O
during O
poxvirus O
infection O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
adequately O
investigated. O
The O
mousepox O
virus O
(ectromelia O
virus, O
ECTV) O
is O
a O
double O
stranded O
DNA O
virus O
that O
belongs O
to O
Poxviridae O
family O
of O
viruses O
in O
the O
genus O
Orthopoxvirus, O
the O
same O
genus O
that O
encompasses O
variola O
virus O
(VARV, O
the O
causative O
agent O
of O
smallpox) O
and O
vaccinia O
virus O
(VACV) O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Infection O
of O
mice O
with O
ECTV O
causes O
symptoms O
much O
similar O
to O
those O
observed O
in O
people O
infected O
with O
VARV O
[ O

Invertase O

thus O
other O

should O
be O

The O

(Rosa O

during O

In O

we O
did O
not O
observe O
that O
higher O

We O
found O
that O
the O

resulted O
in O
a O
slightly O
higher O
soluble O

in O
aos O
and O

(Figs. O

The O

was O
substantially O
higher O

that O
of O

Although O
SuSy O

was O
fivefold O
higher O
than O
in O

the O

was O
almost O
at O
the O

non-typhoidal O
Salmonella O
are O
common O

of O

infections O
in O
people O

However, O
in O
sub-Saharan O
Africa O
(SSA), O
invasive O
non-typhoidal O
Salmonella O
(iNTS) O
bloodstream O
infections O
are O
common O
1 O
, O

totalling O
~3.4 O
million O
cases O
annually, O
with O
S. O
Typhimurium O
being O
responsible O
for O
approximately O
two-thirds O
of O
these O
cases. O
The O
fatality O
rate O
in O
iNTS O
can O
be O
extremely O
high O
3 O
. O
In O
SSA, O
iNTS O
patients O
often O
do O
not O
suffer O
from O
diarrhoea O
but O
instead O
display O
symptoms O
of O
fever O
and O

Whereas O

are O
predominantly O

. O
The O
population O
structure O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium O
ST313 O
is O
dominated O
by O
two O
clonal O
lineages, O
named O
I O
and O
II, O
that O
sequentially O
spread O
across O
SSA O
over O
the O
past O
40 O
years. O

Over O
a O
dozen O
human O
cases O
of O
Photorhabdus O
soft O
tissue O
infections O
and O
disseminated O
bacteremia O
have O
been O
documented O
so O
far, O
but O
many O
more O
are O
probably O
misdiagnosed O
(Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Gerrard O
and O
Stevens O
2017 O
). O
The O
first O
human O
pathogen O
from O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
was O
isolated O
from O
a O
patient O
with O
a O
leg O
ulcer O
in O
the O
USA O
in O
1989 O
(Farmer O
et O
al. O
1989 O
). O
This O
was O
followed O
by O
isolation O
of O
other O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
from O
human O
specimens O
in O
the O
USA O
and O
Australia O
(Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2003 O
). O
Since O
it O
was O
initially O
believed O
that O
these O
bacteria O
were O
not O
able O
to O
establish O
symbiosis O
with O
nematodes, O
the O
new O
species O
created O
for O
them O
was O
named O
P. O
asymbiotica O
to O
emphasize O
this O
feature O
(Fischer-Le O
Saux O
et O
al. O
1999 O
). O
However, O
in O
2006, O
symbionts O
of O
the O
clinical O
Photorhabdus O
strain, O
i.e. O
heterorhabditid O
nematodes, O
were O
described O
and O
classified O
as O
Heterorhabditis O
gerrardi O
(Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2004 O
; O
Gerrard O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
Plichta O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
Thus, O
it O
is O
now O
accepted O
that O
human O
pathogenic O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
are O
able O
to O
form O
a O
mutualistic O
relationships O
with O
Heterorhabditis O
nematodes O
to O
infect O
insects O
efficiently, O
like O
other O
Photorhabdus O
nematode O
symbionts. O
Currently, O
two O
species: O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
comprise O
both O
clinical O
and O
entomopathogenic O
Photorhabdus O
strains O
derived O
from O
various O
locations O
(Kuwata O
et O
al. O
2008 O
; O
Thanwisai O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
To O
address O
the O
particular O
life O
style O
of O
Photorhabdus O
human O
pathogens, O
their O
diversity O
and O
evolutionary O
relationships O
have O
been O
intensively O
explored O
by O
implementing O
whole O
genome O

and O
transcriptomic O
analysis. O
It O
was O
found O
that O
P. B-PATH
asymbiotica I-PATH
and O
P. B-PATH
australis I-PATH
bacteria O
have O
a O
relatively O
small O
genome, O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
P. O

Discussion O
The O

will O
dictate O
how O
well O

and O
the O
incidence O

effects, O
by O

the O

In O
this O

the O
great O
majority O
of O
DME O
mRNAs O
were O
down-regulated O
more O
than O
50% O
at O

peak O
of O
parasitaemia O
in O
the O
P. O

This O
downregulation O

mRNAs, O
each O
of O
which O
was O
expressed O
at O
less O
than O
5% O
of O
that O
observed O
in O
naïve O
control O
mice. O
These O
effects O
cover O
the O
three O
major O
DME O
families: O
P450s, O
Ugts, O
and O
Sults. O
Furthermore, O
levels O
of O
P450 O
proteins O
of O
the O
Cyp2b, O
3a O
and O
4a O

were O
reduced O
by O
20–60%, O
with O
similar O
trends O
for O
Cyp2c, O

These O

producers O
expressed O
significant O
regional O

Many O

that O

that O

In O

For O

Introduction O
The O
Western O
honey O
bee O
(Apis O
mellifera O
L.) O
has O
an O
almost O
global O
distribution, O
both O
as O
wild O
(endemic O
in O
Europe, O
Africa O
and O
the O
middle-East, O
naturalized O
in O
the O
Americas, O
Asia O
and O
Australia) O
and O
as O
a O
managed O
species O
(Moritz O
et O
al. O
2005 O
). O
A. O
mellifera O
is O
the O
most O
important O
managed O
pollinator O
species, O
thereby O
contributing O
to O
both O
food O
security O
and O
production O
of O
apicultural O
products O
worldwide O
(honey, O

wax O
and O
propolis, O
Klein O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Aizen O
et O

). O
It O
is O
therefore O
evident O
that O
apiculture O
is O
of O
significant O
economic O
and O

value. O
As O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
globalization O
of O
apiculture, O
the O
number O
of O
novel O

has O
increased O
through O
host O
shifts O
from O
closely O

This O
was O
the O
case O
for O
the O
ecto-parasitic O
mite O
Varroa O
destructor O
(Anderson O
and O
Trueman O
2000 O
), O
which O
has O
shifted O
hosts O
from O
the O
Eastern O
honey O
bee O
(Apis O
cerana) O
to O
A. O
mellifera. O
This O
mite O
has O
now O
an O
almost O
ubiquitous O
distribution O
(Ellis O
and O
Munn O

) O
and O
is O
the O
primary O

(Neumann O

The O

been O
very O
rapid, O

little O

against O

or O
finally, O
by O
inhibiting O
further O

(Van O

Interestingly, O
A. O

is O
the O
only O

that O

not O
naturally O
carry O

In O
fact, O
in O
about O
half O
of O
the O
cases, O
lung O
resection O
was O
performed O
prior O
diagnosis, O
which O
suggests O
that O
in O
these O
patients O
the O
decision O
of O
lung O
resection O
was O
taken O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
nature O
of O
chronic O
lung O
disease O
was O
probably O
unknown. O
Interestingly, O
lung O
resections O
prior O
to O
diagnosis O
were O
performed O
more O
frequently O
during O
the O
earlier O
decades O
with O
available O
data O
(before O
1990), O
in O
a O
period O
where O
awareness O
and O
knowledge O
about O
PCD O
was O
scarce O
[ O

]. O
This O
seems O
to O
have O
changed O
in O
later O
decades O
(after O
1990), O
where O
the O
opposite O
trend O
was O
observed O
with O
gradually O
less O
lung O
resections O
performed O
prior O
to O
presentation. O
After O
2010, O
it O
appears O
that O
very O
few O
PCD O
patients O
underwent O
lung O
resection O
prior O
to O
presentation O
(18%), O
although O
the O
latter O
figure O
may O
be O
an O
underestimation O
of O
the O
reality O
as O
some O
undiagnosed O
PCD O
patients O
undergoing O
lung O
resection O
in O
the O
last O
few O
years O
might O
have O
not O
been O
diagnosed O
by O
PCD O
centers O
yet. O
Differences O
in O
age O
of O
diagnosis O
as O
well O
as O
in O
surgical O
and O
medical O
care O
of O
bronchiectasis O
across O
countries O
may O
explain O
the O
differences O
in O
the O
rates O
of O
lung O
resection O
across O
countries. O
Persistent O
atelectasis O
and O
consolidation, O
especially O
at O
the O
middle O
and O
lower O
lobes, O
are O
common O
features O
in O
PCD O
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
]. O
In O
comparison O
to O
CF, O
MRI O
and O
CT O
scores O
for O
lung O
collapse/consolidation O
in O
PCD O
are O
of O
higher O
severity, O
[ O
23 O
– O
25 O
] O
which O
may O
be O
a O
contributing O
factor O
to O
the O
more O
frequent O
performance O
of O
lung O
resection O
in O
PCD. O
RML O
was O
by O
far O
the O
most O
frequently O
resected O
lobe, O
indicating O
the O
frequency O
and O
severity O
of O
the O
involvement O
of O
this O
lobe O
in O
PCD O
lung O
disease. O
Previous O

between O
bronchiectasis O
development O
in O
RML O
and O
unfavorable O
clinical O
outcomes O
[ O

]. O
Our O
study O
also O
provides O
important O
insight O
in O
PCD O
disease O
course O
after O
lung O
resection. O
Lobectomised O
patients O
have O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
bronchiectasis O
and O
lower O
FVC O
and O
FEV1 O
at O
first O
post-lung O

assessment O
when O
compared O
to O
their O
matched O
controls, O
as O
may O
be O
expected O
after O
loss O
of O
lung O
tissue. O

In O
addition, O
we O
found O
that O
Pestoides O

(albeit O
at O
a O
higher O
relative O

Furthermore, O
neither O

maintain O

at O
a O
significantly O
different O
copy O

with O

( O

To O
determine O
the O
conservation O
of O

a O

No O

Previously, O
oral O

has O
been O

in O

accumulated O

Therefore, O

In O

a O
Japanese O

was O
used O
for O

infection O
21 O
. O
However, O
the O
oral O
infection O
efficiency O
in O
this O

was O
low O
(2/50). O
Oral O
infection O
with O
clinical O

(10 O

was O
reported O
at O
a O
moderate O
efficiency O
around O
15–40% O
in O
immunodeficient O
AG129 O
mice O
22 O
. O
Recently, O
a O
robust O
oral O
infection O
system O
was O
established O
in O
the O
NOD/SCID O
mouse O
model. O
Approximately O
71% O
of O
orally O
infected O
mice O
developed O
paralysis O
and O

23 O
. O
To O
date, O
efficient O
oral O
infection O
with O
EV71 O
clinical O
isolates O
(non-mouse-adapted) O
can O
be O
conducted O
only O
in O
the O
immunodeficient O
NOD/SCID O
mouse O
model. O
In O
this O
study, O
by O
using O
the O
more O
efficient O
oral O
infection O
system O
of O
NOD/SCID O
mice, O
we O
detected O

in O

RNA O
in O

and O
lung O
of O
moribund O
mice. O
Massive O
infiltration O
of O
leukocytes O
can O
be O
detected O
in O
both O
tissues. O

Therefore, O
an O
important O
experimental O
tool O
is O
to O
generate O
gnotobiotic O
mouse O
colonies O
maintaining O
a O
stable O
and O
defined O
microbiota O
derived O
from O
individual O
human O
subjects, O
functionally O
recapitulating O
the O
complex O
SPF O
microbiota O
and O
normalizing O
mouse O
physiology O
[ O
78 O
]. O
Towards O
this O
goal, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
a O
small O
number O
of O
culturable O
bacterial O
strains O
can O
cover O
most O
of O
the O
functional O
potential O
of O
the O
gut O
microbiome O
[ O
79 O
, O
80 O
]. O
Individual O
strains O
of O
interest O
can O
then O
be O
introduced O
and O
their O
immunomodulatory O
roles O
can O
be O
studied O
in O
the O
context O
of O
more O
physiologically O
relevant O
conditions O
[ O
80 O
]. O
An O
alternative O
to O
using O
GF O
mice O
as O
human O
microbiota O
recipient O
is O
the O
use O
of O
antibiotic-treated O
SPF O
mice. O
Although O
SPF O
mice O
with O
intact O
microbiota O
are O
generally O
not O
receptive O
to O
human O
microbiota, O
engraftment O
can O
be O
substantially O
improved O
with O
certain O
antibiotic O
regimens, O
which O
deplete O
the O
bulk O
of O
the O
pre-existing O
commensals, O
thus O
opening O
up O
an O
niche O
for O
subsequent O
colonization O
[ O
81 O
, O
82 O
]. O
Such O
models O
can O
be O
a O
useful O
alternative O
in O
mechanistic O
studies O
with O
some O
mouse O
strains O
of O
genetically O
engineered O
mouse O
models O
unavailable O
in O
GF O
status. O
However, O
the O
potential O
contribution O
of O
residual O
non-depleted O
mouse O
microbiota O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
such O
experimental O
settings, O
including O
its O
influence O
not O
only O
on O
the O
host O
but O
also O
on O
the O
acquired O
human O
microbes. O
When O
interpreting O
results O
from O
experiments O
with O
GF O
mice, O
it O
should O
also O
be O
considered O
that O
even O
though O
GF O
mice O
are O
devoid O
of O
detectable O
viable O
microbiota, O
they O
are O
exposed O
to O
microbial O
residues O
(MAMPs, O
PAMPs, O
or O
antigens) O
derived O
from O
dead O
bacteria O
in O
sterile O
diet O
and O
bedding O
[ O
83 O
]. O
If O
present O
in O
sufficient O
quantities, O
these O
molecules O
could O
theoretically O
affect O
immune O
functions O
in O
a O
similar O
manner O
as O
do O
intact O
viable O
bacteria. O
For O
instance, O
MAMPs/PAMPs O
can O
be O
recognized O
by O
PRRs O
on O
intestinal O
epithelium O
or O

immune O
cell O
subsets O
leading O

1) O
Inflammasome-related O

in O
the O

mice; O
2) O

and O
this O
fibrosis O
was O
significantly O
reduced O
in O
mice O
deficient O
in O
NLRP3, O
ASC, O
and O
IL-1β; O
3) O
ASC O
deficiency O
reduced O
the O

Malate, O

and O
fructose O
fuel O
the O
glycolysis O
and O
oxidative O
phosphorylation O
pathways O
and O
satisfy O
the O
increased O
energy O
demand. O
In O
addition, O
glucose O
probably O
is O
utilized O
for O
cellulose O
synthesis. O
Glucuronic O
acid O
and O
xylose O
show O
a O
small O
peak O
in O
concentration O
within O
interaction O
zone O
1. O
These O
are O
both O
possible O
components O
of O
hemicellulose O
and O
S-methylcysteine; O
the O
latter O
is O
a O
possible O
precursor O
for O
alexine O
synthesis. O
Both O
compounds O
are O
increased O

and O

are O
most O
likely O
degradation O

Alternatively, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
downstream O
synthesis O
of O
hemi-cellulose O
is O
restrained, O
causing O
the O
accumulation O
of O

components. O
Threonic O
acid O
and O
tartaric O
acid, O
decomposition O
products O
of O
ascorbate, O
increase O
in O
concentrations O
within O
zone O
2. O
Although O
ascorbate O
concentrations O
were O
not O
directly O
measured, O
it O
can O
be O
assumed, O
based O
on O
transcriptome O
data O
and O
the O
above O
mentioned O
results, O
that O
the O
ascorbate O
concentration O
is O
reduced, O
a O
status O
that O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
induction O
of O

. O
Furthermore, O
vitamin O
C O
is O
an O
important O
anti-oxidative O

Concluding O
remarks O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
inoculation O
of O
lettuce O
cv. O
Tizian O
with O
R. O
solani O
AG1-IB O
causes O
large-scale O
reprogramming O
of O
the O
transcriptome O
and O
metabolome O
in O
lettuce O
leaf O
tissue. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
role O
of O
lettuce O
in O
the O
interaction O
is O
not O
as O
passive O
as O
was O
previously O
assumed. O
Analysis O
of O
the O
metabolite O
profiles O
and O
the O
differentiated O
patterns O
of O
PRG O
transcript O
levels O
between O
the O
three O
interaction O
zones O
very O
much O
corroborates O
active O
defence O
efforts O
of O
lettuce. O
The O
defence O
reaction O
of O
lettuce O
has O
more O
in O
common O
with O
a O
guarded O
retreat, O
where O
spread O
of O
the O
fungus O
is O
minimized O
or O
retarded, O
instead O
of O
an O
offensive O
defence O
approach. O
In O
the O
introduction, O
we O
postulated O
that O
an O
SA O
mediated O
early O
response O
can O
be O
beneficial O
during O
the O
initial O
phase O
of O
interaction. O

Perhaps O
maintaining O
NFκB O
activity O
within O
a O
normal O
range O
is O
crucial O
for O
natural O
defense O
against O
intestinal O
inflammation. O
Either O
too O
much O
or O
too O
little O
NFκB O
activation O
might O
be O
detrimental O
to O
the O
intestinal O
homoeostasis. O
Consistent O
with O
these O
notions, O
reciprocal O
positive-feedback O
regulation O
between O
REGγ O
and O
NFκB O
in O
IEC O
harbours O
the O
risk O
for O
run-away O
NFκB O
overactivation O
and O
development O
of O
bowel O
inflammation O
and O
CAC O
in O
DSS O
models. O
By O
analysing O
the O
correlation O
between O
REGγ O
and O
IBD O
in O
published O
database O
(ID:GSE10616), O
we O
found O
no O
significant O
changes O
in O
REGγ O
expression O
between O
CD O
and O
normal O
controls. O
However, O
the O
UC O
group O
had O
elevated O
REGγ O
expression, O
suggesting O
that O
CD O
and O
UC O
are O
two O
different O
forms O
of O
IBD. O
The O
UPS O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
activation O
of O
the O
NFκB O
pathway. O
Ubiquitin-dependent O
degradation O
of O
IκBs O
is O
central O
to O
activating O
NFκB. O
However, O
we O
now O
further O
reveal O
that O
IκBɛ O
is O
subject O
to O
REGγ-proteasome-dependent O
degradation, O
which O
thereby O
neutralizes O
these O
protective O
effects O
in O
WT O
mice. O
So O
far, O
most O
of O
the O
REGγ O
target O
proteins O
can O
also O
be O
degraded O
by O
ubiquitin-dependent O
pathway. O
We O
have O
proposed O
that O
under O
physiological O
condition, O
REGγ O
mainly O
degrades O
target O
proteins O
to O
maintain O
relatively O
lower O
steady-state O
levels. O
Pathological O
increase O
of O
REGγ O
upon O
DSS O
treatment O
may O
tip O
the O
balance O
between O
ubiquitin-dependent O
and O
ubiquitin-independent O
degradation O
pathway. O
Interestingly, O
no O
previous O
physiological O
functions O
in O
inflammation O
or O
innate O
immune O
defenses O
have O
been O
established O
for O
IκBɛ. O
Here O
we O
have O
defined O
KC, O
MIP2α O
and O
CXCL5 O
as O
IκBɛ-regulated O
genes O
in O
colon O
epithelial O
cells O
and O
elucidated O
REGγ O
as O
a O
specific O
regulator O
for O
IκBɛ O
( O
Supplementary O
Fig. O
4C O
), O
expanding O
our O
knowledge O
to O
the O
IκBɛ O
regulatory O
pathway. O

Furthermore, O
Gherardi O
et O
al. O
provided O
evidence O
on O
the O
serotyping O
limit O
of O
molecular O
techniques, O
since O
15 O
out O
of O
91 O
GBS O
isolated O
from O
Italian O
hospitals O
still O
yielded O
the O
result O
NT O
by O
conventional O
phenotypic O
methods, O
failing O
to O
give O
any O
amplification O
of O
the O
cps O
locus O
by O
the O
molecular O
method O
[ O
53 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
absence O
of O
some O
serotypes O
could O
not O
necessarily O
reflect O
an O
immunological O
method O
failure, O
rather O
than O
to O
arise O
by O
the O
differences O
in O
their O
geographical O
distribution. O
In O
fact, O
serotypes O
VI, O
VII, O
and O
VIII O
are O
the O
most O
common O
colonizers O
of O
Asia O
[ O
54 O
– O
56 O
] O
and O
Egypt O
[ O
17 O
]; O
instead, O
serotype O
IX O
was O
isolated O
in O
Denmark O
and O
Australia O
[ O
2 O
, O
57 O
]. O
In O
the O
last O
few O
decades, O
the O
adoption O
of O
preventive O
strategies, O
including O
prenatal O
GBS O
colonization O
screening O
combined O
with O
intrapartum O
antibiotic O
prophylaxis, O
allowed O
to O
significantly O
decrease O
the O
incidence O
of O
GBS O
neonatal O
infections O
worldwide O
[ O
21 O
, O
31 O
]. O
The O
efficacy O
of O
antibiotic O
prophylaxis O
strictly O
depends O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
antimicrobial O
drugs. O
This O
aspect O
assumes O
fundamental O
importance O
for O
both O
the O
different O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
profile O
of O
GBS O
and O
the O
increasing O
development O
of O
resistance O
mechanisms O
against O
the O
most O
common O
antimicrobial O
agents O
used O
in O
pregnancy O
as O
prevention O
therapy O
[ O
23 O
– O
27 O
]. O
Nevertheless, O
the O
current O
guidelines O
for O
intrapartum O
prophylaxis O
do O
not O
include O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
testing, O
which O
instead O
should O
be O
considered O
a O
routine O
test O
during O
the O
antenatal O
screening, O
able O
to O
ensure O
the O
efficacy O
of O
prophylactic O
therapy O
[ O
31 O
, O
40 O
]. O
In O
Italy, O
the O
evaluation O
of O
bacterial O
resistance O
against O
the O
main O
antibiotics O
used O
in O
IAP O
is O
limited O
to O
a O
few O
studies, O
most O
of O
which O
regard O
central O
[ O
35 O
, O
58 O
] O
and O
northern O
regions O
[ O
59 O
], O
whereas O
no O
data O
concerning O
the O
Sicily O
have O
been O
reported. O
Therefore, O
in O
our O
work, O
we O
evaluated O
the O
antimicrobial O
susceptibility O
profiling O
of O
3494 O
clinical O
isolates O
of O
S. O
agalactiae O
collected O
during O
5 O
years O
(from O
2015 O
to O
2019), O
in O
Sicily. O

There O
is O
an O
indisputable O
geographical O
bias O
to O
the O
populations O
sampled O
by O
psychologists. O
For O
example, O
a O
review O
of O
articles O
published O
between O
2006 O
and O
2010 O
in O
the O
three O
experimental O
developmental O
psychology O
journals O
with O
the O
highest O
impact O
factors O
found O
that O
over O
90% O
of O
the O
research O
participants O
came O
from O
Australia, O
Canada, O
Europe, O
the O
USA, O
or O
New O
Zealand, O
while O
under O
3% O
of O
the O
participants O
in O
the O
research O
studies O
were O
from O
Africa, O
Asia, O
Central O
and O
South O
America O
and O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
Israel O
(Nielsen O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Similarly, O
in O
the O
flagship O
journal O
‘Journal O
of O
Personality O
and O
Social O
Psychology’, O
96% O
of O
the O
papers O
published O
in O
2012 O
were O
based O
on O
WEIRD O
samples O
(Kurzban O
2013 O
). O
Further, O
from O
its O
inception, O
psychology O
has O
relied O
heavily O
on O
undergraduate O
samples, O
a O
situation O
that O
has O
not O
changed O
substantially O
over O
time. O
For O
example, O
Gallander O
Wintre O
et O
al. O
( O
2001 O
) O
reviewed O
1179 O
articles O
spanning O
six O
journals O
across O
the O
different O
subdivisions O
of O
psychology O
and O
found O
68% O
of O
the O
samples O
to O
be O
student O
samples. O
They O
also O
found O
that, O
if O
anything, O
the O
reliance O
on O
student O
samples O
had O
increased O
between O
1975 O
and O
1995. O
A O
classic O
paper O
by O
Sears O
( O
1986 O
) O
reviewed O
papers O
published O
in O
1980 O
in O
three O
mainstream O
social O
psychology O
journals O
and O
found O
that O
82% O
of O
the O
samples O
used O
students O
in O
some O
form, O
and O
75% O
used O
undergraduate O
students O
(mainly O
from O
the O
USA) O
exclusively. O
Likewise, O
the O
1995 O
editions O
of O
two O
leading O
social O
psychology O
journals O
(‘Journal O
of O
Experimental O
Social O
Psychology’ O
and O
‘Journal O
of O
Personality O
and O
Social O
Psychology’) O
used O
undergraduate O
students O
as O
participants O
in O
95.8% O
and O
70.6% O
of O
all O
cases O
respectively O
(Gallander O
Wintre O
et O
al. O
2001 O
), O
and O
Arnett O
( O
2008 O
) O
calculated O
that O
74% O
of O
the O
samples O
in O
the O
journal O
‘Social O
Psychological O
and O
Personality O
Science’ O
were O
from O
student O
populations. O
The O
issues O
relating O
to O
sampling O
are O
not O
limited O
to O
(social) O
psychology, O
and O
similar O
concerns O
have O
been O
voiced O
in O
other O
related O
disciplines O
such O
as O
consumer O
research O
(Peterson O
2001 O
), O
education O
research O
(Usher O
2018 O
), O
behavioural O
economics O
(Levitt O
and O
List O
2007 O
) O
and O
business O
research O
(Bello O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
For O
example, O
Peterson O
( O
2001 O
) O
reviewed O
the O
literature O
in O
consumer O
research O
and O
found O
86% O
of O
the O
samples O
to O
be O
from O
students. O

Remarkably, O
the O
luciferase O
activity O
of O
all O
but O
two O
translational O
fusions O
significantly O
decreased O
by O
hfq O
deletion O
(Fig. O

The O
exceptions O
were O
iolT2::lux O

a O

with O
equal O
transcription O
in O
both O
strains, O
and O
iolR::lux O
with O
slightly O
elevated O
activity. O
The O
strongest O
response, O
namely O
an O
approximately O
14-fold O
decrease O
of O
transcriptional O
activity, O
was O
observed O
for O
the O
iolD2::lux O
fusion, O
and O
even O
the O
transcription O
of O
the O
MI-transporter O
gene O

showed O
a O
twofold O
reduction. O
A O
negative O
effect O
of O
the O
hfq O

on O

was O
also O
observed. O
Taken O
together, O
these O
data O
are O
compatible O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
Hfq O

It O

that O
bacterial O
sRNAs O

perform O
a O
broad O
range O
of O

functions. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
cis-encoded O
antisense O
RNAs, O
trans-encoded O
sRNAs O
typically O
range O
from O
50 O

Recently, O
we O
discriminated O
numerous O
various O

through O

China O
by O

[ O

Along O
with O
the O
large-scale O
application O
of O
several O
improved O
varieties, O
all-female O
allogynogenetic O
gibel O
carp O
activated O

has O
become O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O

fish O
in O
China O
[ O

The O
annual O

has O
increased O
to O
more O
than O
2.82 O
million O
tons O
in O
2017 O
[ O

]. O
However, O
the O
highly O
intensive O
farming O
has O
resulted O
in O
serious O
disease O
problems. O
Especially, O
the O
infections O
of O
herpesvirus O
CaHV O
in O
crucian O
carp O
(Carassius O
auratus), O
a O
newly O
emerged O
epizootic O
disease O
with O
acute O
gill O

and O
high O
mortality, O
has O
outbroken O
in O
main O
culture O
areas O
of O
Jiangsu O
province O
and O
caused O
huge O
economic O
losses O
since O
2012 O
[ O

]. O
Herpesviruses O
are O
widespread O
among O
vertebrates, O
some O
of O
which O
caused O
devastating O
diseases O
in O
aquaculture O
[ O
20 O

25 O
]. O
One O
of O
effective O
ways O
to O
reduce O
the O
threat O
is O
to O
breed O
resistant O
strains O
or O
crossbreeds O
to O
viral O
infection O
[ O

In O
our O
previous O
study, O
we O
revealed O
the O
distinct O
resistances O
to O
herpesvirus O
CaHV O
among O
three O
gynogenetic O
clones O
of O
gibel O

) O
[ O

], O
the O
most O

in O
China, O
was O
a O
highly O

clone. O
The O

[ O

], O
nominated O
as O
the O
allogynogenetic O
gibel O

showed O
moderately O

We O
also O
identified O

From O

be O
concluded O
that O
the O

both O

but O
the O

was O
still O
much O
higher O

that O
of O

the O

also O
examined O

Since O
the O

Discussion O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
drug O
resistance O
of O
R. O
anatipestifer O
has O
become O
increasingly O
serious, O
and O
various O
mechanisms O
of O
drug O
resistance O
have O
gradually O
been O
revealed, O
such O
as O
those O
for O
resistance O
to O
chloramphenicol O
[ O
13 O
], O
lincomycin O
[ O
14 O
], O
aminoglycosides O
[ O
15 O
] O
and O
rifampin O
[ O
16 O
]. O
However, O
the O
resistance O
mechanism O
of O
rifampin O
has O
not O
been O
reported. O

]. O
During O
the O
process, O
any O
reduction O
in O
cystatin O
C-cathepsin O
S O
ratio O
may O
result O
in O
a O
substantial O
enhancement O
in O
active O
cathepsin O
S. O
Studies O
on O
cystatin O
C O
derived O
from O
human O
seminal O
plasma O
using O
the O
dot-blot O
technique O
revealed O
that O
cystatin O
C O
interacted O
with O
different O
HIV-1 O
proteins, O
such O
as O
gp160, O
gp120, O
p31, O
p24 O
including O
HIV O
protease. O
Importantly, O
HIV O
protease O
function O
relies O
on O
generating O
mature O
functional O
protein O
components O
of O
an O
infectious O
HIV O
virion. O
Authors O
have O
suggested O
that O
if O
cystatin O
C O
was O
able O
to O
inhibit O
HIV O
protease O
activity, O
it O
might O
prevent O
the O
normal O
function O
of O
the O
HIV O
protease O
and O
therefore O
would O
potentially O
prevent O
viral O
replication O
and O
transmission O
[ O
58 O
]. O
Our O
immunofluorescence O
analysis O
revealed O
evident O
co-localization O
of O
cathepsin O
L O
and O
partial O
co-localization O
of O
cystatin O
B O
with O
viral O
factories O
since O
early O
stages O
of O
ECTV O
infection O
in O
JAWS O
II O
and O
GM-BM O
cells. O
Although O
the O
distribution O
of O
cathepsin O
B O
was O
significantly O
reduced O
at O
each O
time O
point O
of O
infection, O
we O
did O
not O
observe O
co-localization O
between O
this O
protease O
and O
viral O
factories O
in O
tested O
cells. O
Fiegl O
and O
co-workers O
[ O
59 O
] O
have O
observed O
significant O
co-localization O
between O
Chlamydia O
psittaci O
and O
cathepsin O
D O
in O
JAWS O
II O
dendritic O
cell O
line O
at O
72 O
hpi. O
Moreover, O
authors O
have O
indicated O
that O
inhibition O
of O
cathepsin O
D O
or O
S O
decreased O
stimulation O
of O
Chlamydia-specific O
CD8 O
+ O
T O
cells, O
suggesting O
a O
crucial O
role O
of O
these O
proteases O
in O
efficient O
processing O
of O
chlamydial O
antigens. O
Moreover, O
degradation O
of O
Chlamydia O
by O
cathepsins O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
generation O
of O
bacterial O
epitopes O
for O
antigen O
presentation O
in O
infected O

There O
are O
now O
several O
studies O
linking O
obesity O
and O
other O
metabolic O

with O
an O

AD. O
In O

the O

were O
also O

The O
‘gut O

can O
be O
defined O
as O
all O
the O

within O
the O
ecosystem O
and O
are O
considered O
the O
largest O
reservoir O
of O
microbes O
in O
the O
human O
body, O
containing O
about O
10 O
14 O
microbes. O
Over O
99% O
of O
microbiota O
in O
the O
GI O

are O
anaerobic O
bacteria, O
with O
archaebacterial, O
protozoa, O
fungi, O
and O
other O
microorganisms O
making O
up O
the O
remainder O
(Hill O
et O

2014 O
). O
These O
GI O
microbiota O
play O
many O
important O
roles O
in O
physiological O
homeostasis O
and O
metabolism, O
conferring O
many O
health O
benefits O
on O
the O
host O
organism, O
including O
pathogen O
displacement, O
immune O
system O
development, O
barrier O
fortification, O
vitamin O
production O
and O
nutrient O
absorption, O
and O
is O
often O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
‛forgotten O
organ’ O
as O
a O
result O
of O
what O
it O
is O
(O’Hara O
and O
Shanahan, O
2006 O
). O
Consequently, O
there O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
impetus O
for O
the O
comprehensive O
understanding O
of O
the O
complete O
pathological O
function, O
genetic O
information O
and O
functional O
diversity O
of O
the O
gut O

that O
may O
lead O
to O
clinical O
AD O
and O
the O
discovery O
of O
variable O

factors O
(Clemente O
et O

). O
In O
this O
review, O
we O
examine O
the O
roles O
of O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
in O
the O
maintenance O
of O
health, O
inflammation O

and O
how O
it O

highlighting O
the O

particularly O
in O

Finally, O
we O
discuss O
the O
potential O

we O
used O
the O

proposed O
by O

[ O

] O
to O
define O
healthcare-associated O

and O
we O
found O
that O
HCA O
infections O
accounted O
for O
over O
half O
of O
the O
K. B-PATH

infections. O
HCA O
infections O
showed O
similar O
clinical O
features O
with O
nosocomial O
infections. O
CA O
infections O
presented O
different O
characteristic O
from O
both O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
infections. O
Hematological O
malignancy O
was O
more O
commonly O
related O
to O
nosocomial O
infections, O
whereas O
diabetes O
mellitus O
was O
more O
frequently O
associated O
with O
CA O
infections. O
These O
findings O
were O
also O
observed O
in O
previous O
reports O
from O
Taiwan O
and O
Korea O
[ O
23 O
, O
24 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
cancer O
was O
more O
commonly O
associated O
with O

bacteremia O
patients O
than O
CA O
bacteremia O
patients O
[ O

]. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
however, O
cerebral O

and O

were O
more O
associated O
with O
HCA O

compared O
to O

combined O
with O

of O

that O

are O
key O

for O

Drought O
Drought, O
typically O
associated O
with O
high O
photoinhibition O
and O
temperature O
stresses, O
is O
among O
abiotic O
stresses O
that O
exert O
great O
affect O
on O
plant O
growth O
and O
development. O
It O
occurs O
due O
to O
water O
deficiency O
when O
their O
availability O
become O
reduced O
to O
critical O
levels O
accompanied O
by O
high O
solar O
radiation O
and O

[ O
6 O
, O
154 O
, O

]. O
This O
may O
cause O
many O
changes O
in O

of O
plants, O
including O
arrest O
of O

growth O
and O

Thus, O
may O
affect O

for O
the O
production O
of O
PSMs O
through O
provision O
of O
precursors O
or O

from O

In O
many O
recent O
reports, O
it O
had O
been O
shown O
that O
exposure O
of O

to O
the O
drought O
promoted O

This O
issue O
is O
well-understood O
in O
the O
field O
of O
psychometrics O
and O
has O
led O
to O
the O
development O
of O
measurement O
techniques O
and O
tests O
to O
examine O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
constructs O
are O
measured O
consistently O
across O
cultures O
(Heine O
et O
al. O
2002 O
; O
Hui O
and O
Triandis O
1985 O
; O
Nasif O
et O
al. O
1991 O
; O
Poortinga O
1989 O
; O
Van O
de O
Vijver O
and O
Leung O
1997 O
). O
We O
did O
not O
explicitly O
assess O
how O
many O
papers O
established O
equivalence O
of O
measurement O
between O
different O
samples, O
as O
we O
focused O
on O
the O
samples. O
Our O
standard O
psychological O
instruments, O
often O
developed O
by O
researchers O
working O
within O
WEIRD O
settings, O
may O
limit O
the O
generalisability O
of O
research O
findings O
(Ceci O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Konečni O
2010 O
; O
Rochat O
2010 O
). O
We O
therefore O
call O
for O
more O
research O
explicitly O
establishing O
that O
the O
same O
‘thing’ O
is O
measured O
in O
different O
populations. O
Depending O
on O
the O
sampling O
scheme, O
broadening O
the O
research O
to O
non-WEIRD O
populations O
could O
also O
give O
rise O
to O
problems O
such O
as O
non-independence O
(Mace O
and O
Pagel O
1994 O
; O
Naroll O
1965 O
; O
Pollet O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Ross O
and O
Homer O
1976 O
), O
which O
then O
would O
need O
to O
be O
addressed. O
We O
do O
not O
discuss O
these O
issues O
in O
further O
detail O
here, O
as O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
they O
matter O
could O
differ O
on O
design O
(experiment/correlational), O
covariates O
and O
research O
question. O
For O
example, O
for O
many O
psychophysical O
studies, O
and O
also O
evolutionary O
psychological O
studies O
(Tybur O
et O
al. O
2014 O
), O
the O
focus O
is O
on O
within-individual O
differences. O
The O
implicit O
assumption O
is O
that O
these O
would O
not O
vary O
depending O
on O
the O
population O
studied. O
For O
such O
studies, O
it O
would O
be O
useful O
for O
authors O
to O
be O
more O
explicit O
to O
which O
degree O
these O
within-individual O
differences O
are O
expected O
to O
generalise O
to O
other O
samples. O
In O
some O
cases, O
restricted O
sampling O
in O
itself O
is O
useful O
to O
determine O
whether O
a O
behaviour O
exists O
or O
not, O
and O
as O
such O
testing O
a O
WEIRD, O
student O
and/or O
online O
population O
could O
constitute O
a O
necessary O
first O
step O
(Greenwood O
1982 O
; O
Mook O
1983 O
). O
Given O
that O
every O
sample O
is O
restricted O
in O
some O
way, O
authors O
can O
usefully O
make O
a O
statement O
pertaining O
to O
the O
constraints O
on O
generality, O
to O
explain O
the O
boundaries O
of O
the O
population O
that O
they O
believe O
their O
results O
to O
apply O
to O
(Simons O

The O

[ O

To O
determine O
the O
potential O
pathogens O
that O
cause O
diarrhea O
in O
infants, O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
of O
local, O

was O
first O
analyzed O
to O
get O
a O

Gut O

from O
seven O

The O

of O
a O

Firmicutes, O

were O
identified O
as O
the O
most O

the O

Bulk O
analysis O
did O
not O
show O
a O
concurrent O
decrease O
in O
mitochondrial O
respiration O
with O
glycolytic O
inhibition, O
indicating O
cellular O
dependence O
on O
other O
carbon O
sources. O
We O
therefore O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
whether O
this O
dependence O
on O
alternative O
carbon O
sources O
was O
true O
for O
the O
entire O
population O
or O
specific O
for O
a O
subset O
of O
cells O
within O
bulk O
analysis. O
To O
evaluate O
the O
dynamics O
of O
metabolic O
protein-level O
changes, O
we O
incorporated O
the O
phosphorylation O
state O
of O
ribosomal O
protein O
S6 O
(pS6) O
into O
Met-Flow. O
The O
S6 O
protein O
is O
downstream O
of O
mTORC1 O
signaling O
and O
is O
phosphorylated O
upon O
TCR O
engagement, O
driving O
translation O
of O
glycolytic O
proteins O
in O
T O
cells O
2 O
, O
45 O
. O
Met-Flow O
analysis O
showed O
increased O
levels O
of O
CD69, O
CD25, O
and O
GLUT1 O
in O
pS6-positive O
cells O
compared O
with O
pS6-negative O
cells, O
whereas O
other O
metabolic O
proteins O
showed O
heterogeneous O
expression O
(Fig. O
5e O
). O
This O
phosphorylation O
was O
specifically O
induced O
by O
CD3/28 O
stimulation, O
as O
untreated O
or O
2-FDG O
treated O
T O
cells O
are O
pS6 O
negative. O
However, O
2-FDG O
dampened O
this O
activation-induced O
increase O
in O
the O
bulk O
population O
(Fig. O
5f O
). O
Within O
memory O
subsets, O
stimulation O
increased O
S6 O
phosphorylation O
across O
all O
cells O
compared O
with O
unstimulated O
conditions. O
In O
the O
naive O
and O
T O
CM O
subsets, O
there O
was O
a O
mean O
of O
67% O
and O
69% O
pS6-positive O
cells, O
respectively, O
whereas O
T O
EM O
and O
T O
TEMRA O
were O
38% O
and O
36%. O
The O
addition O
of O
2-FDG O
to O
stimulation O
caused O
the O
majority O
of O
cells O
to O
become O
pS6 O
negative O
in O
all O
subsets, O
apart O
from O
CD4 O
+ O
T O
CM O
cells, O
in O
which O
the O
majority O
of O
cells O
maintained O
pS6 O
positivity. O
This O
indicates O
their O
dependence O
on O
carbon O
sources O
other O
than O
glucose. O
These O
findings O
demonstrate O
the O
ability O
of O
Met-Flow O
to O
identify O
cellular O
populations O
with O
alternative O
metabolic O
reliance, O
which O
would O
not O
be O
achievable O
using O
other O
methodologies. O
In O
sum, O
bulk O
real-time O
respiration O
analysis O
confirms O
our O
previously O
described O
differential O
effect O
of O
activation O
and O
glycolytic O
inhibition O
on O
the O
metabolic O
state O
of O
T O
cells. O

With O
fold-changes O
of O
up O
to O
60, O
it O
can O
be O
assumed O
that O
these O
are O
of O
great O
importance O
during O
the O
lettuce/R. O
solani O
interaction. O
WRKYs O
play O
essential O
roles O
in O
plants O
including O
biotic O
and O
abiotic O
defences, O
development O
and O
senescence O
45 O
. O
Although O
WRKYs O
have O
been O
studied O
for O
many O
plant O
species, O
only O
little O
information O
is O
available O
for O
lettuce O
WRKYs. O
Apart O
from O
activation O
of O
plant O
defences, O
Hordeum O
vulgare O
WRKY1 O
and O
WRKY2 O
homologs O
for O
example O
are O
involved O
in O
regulation O
of O
PTI O
and O
ETI O

67 O
, O
whereas O
two O
close O
homologs O
of O
rice O
WRKY45 O
either O
regulate O
SA O
or O
JA O
levels O
68 O
. O
Future O

on O
lettuce O
WRKYs O
should O
elucidate O
their O
function O
in O
pathogen O

and O

Metabolite O
profiles O
are O
distinctive O
for O
each O
interaction O
zone O
Regarding O
the O
metabolite O
analysis, O
we O
should O
mention O
that O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
previously O
discussed O
transcriptome O
analysis, O
most O
metabolites O
cannot O
be O
attributed O
to O
one O
of O
the O
two O
interaction O
partners O
definitively. O
Combining O
the O
knowledge O
gained O
from O
the O
transcriptomes O
and O
comparison O
with O
the O
blank O
and O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
level O
of O
interaction, O
these O
profiles O
can O
be O
interpreted. O
One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
compounds O
identified O
in O
the O
metabolite O
analysis O
is O
the O
non-metabolizable O
sucrose-analog O
turanose. O
It O
is O
involved O
in O
signal O
transduction O
and O
priming O
of O
defence O
in O
Lycopersicon O
peruvianum O
(tomato), O
Zea O
mays O
(maize) O
and O
Oryza O
sativa O
(rice) O
69 O
, O
70 O
. O
Several O
studies O
report O
on O
a O
reduction O
of O
the O
turanose O
content O
after O
plant O
infection O
with O
R. O
solani, O
most O
likely O
because O
fungi O
unlike O
plants O
are O
capable O
to O
metabolize O
turanose O
70 O
, O
71 O
. O
In O
contrast, O
co-inoculation O
with O
Bacillus O
amyloliquefaciens O
resulted O
in O
a O
turanose O
concentration O
comparable O
to O
the O
control O
samples O
and O
it O
was O
suggested O
that O
this O
adjustment O
is O
mechanistic O
in O
plant O
priming. O
We O
propose O
a O
slightly O
modified O
hypothesis O
where O
not O
the O
absolute O
concentration O
but O
the O
change O
in O
concentration O
of O
turanose O
is O
able O
to O
prime O

Presence O
of O
bacterial O
DNA O
in O
tissue O
samples O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
document O
the O
viability O
or O
infectivity O
of O
a O
pathogen O
in O
the O
host. O
Culturing O
is O
the O
gold O
standard O
for O
proving O
the O
viability O
or O
infectiousness O
of O
microorganisms, O
but O
this O
is O
costly, O
time-consuming, O
difficult O
for O
many O
tick-borne O
pathogens, O
and O
generally O
suffers O
from O
a O
low O
sensitivity O
[ O
36 O
]. O
PCR-array O
also O
has O
its O
limits, O
and O
there O
might O
be O
presence O
of O
bacteria O
below O
detectable O
concentrations O
[ O
37 O
]. O
Also, O
vector O
competence O
requires O
larval O
(or O
nymphal) O
ticks O
to O
be O
infected O
from O
their O
blood O
meal O
and O
passing O
viable O
pathogens O
at O
the O
nymphal O
(or O
adult O

stage O
to O
a O
novel O
host. O
However, O
since O
many O
studies O
are O
indicating O
I. O
ricinus O
as O
the O
vector O
and O
cervids O
as O
potential O
hosts O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum, O
DNA-based O
detection O
provides O
useful O
information O
when O
aiming O
to O
elucidate O
the O
different O
enzootic O
cycles. O
There O
are, O
however, O
several O
other O
difficult O
issues O
in O
determining O
circulation O
and O
enzootic O
cycles O
of O
pathogens. O
Adaptations O
of O
bacteria O
to O
specific O
host O
groups O
require O
mutations O
in O
coding O
genes, O
but O
many O
mutations O
are O
neutral O
and O
single O
mutation O
sequence O
dissimilarity O
is O
not O
sufficient O
in O
the O
meaning O
of O
ecotype O
characterization O
or O
bacterial O
speciation O
[ O
38 O
]. O
That O
we O
found O
both O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
in O
moose, O
can O
be O
seen O
as O
evidence O
that O
ecotype O
are O
not O
entirely O
host-specific O
and O
have O
overlapping O
niches. O
The O
distinction O
between O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
are O
less O
marked O
than O
the O
distinction O
between O
ecotype O
I/II O
and O
the O
other O
two O
ecotypes, O
involving O
many O
different O
ruminant O
hosts. O
The O
ankA O
gene O
identifies O
some O
of O
the O
same O
correlation O
to O
host O
species O
as O
groEL O
[ O
14 O
]. O
Both O
methods O
group O
sequences O
so O
that O
roe O
deer O
is O
probably O
not O
the O
major O
reservoir O
of O
granulocytic O
anaplasmosis O
in O
humans O
and O
domestic O
animals, O
and O
that O
red O
deer O
could O
be O
the O
reservoir O
for O
that O
ecotype. O
A O
limitation O
of O
our O
methodology O
is O
that O
co-infection O
of O
ecotypes O
would O
not O
be O
discovered. O

Pathovars O
of O
P. O

have O
a O
complex O

of O

in O

Additional O
QTLs O

with O
tissue-specific O
responses O
of O
A. O
chinensis O
to O
Psa O
in O
the O
stab O
and O

bioassays O
and O
some O
of O
these O
overlapped. O
For O
example, O
QTLs O
for O
phenotypes O
in O
vascular O
tissues O
including O
Stem_necrosis, O
Stem_collapse O
and O
Ooze O
were O
adjacent O
or O
overlapped O
on O
LGs O
13 O
and O
16, O
but O
QTLs O
for O

were O
located O
on O
LGs O
3, O
5, O
7, O
10, O
and O
18 O
(Fig. O

This O
is O
consistent O
with O
a O
previous O
finding O
where O
distinct O
quantitative O
genetic O
variation O
underlies O
leaf-specific O
and O
stem-specific O
phenotypic O
responses O
to O
a O

52 O
. O
As O
the O
QTLs O
located O
using O
bioassays O
were O
not O
identified O
for O
field O
Psa O
resistance, O
it O
appears O
probable O
that O
different O
genetic O
mechanisms O
regulate O
the O
response O
to O
Psa O
infection O
in O
different O
environments O
and O
in O
different O

Many O
environmental O
factors O
differ O
in O
greenhouse O
and O
in O
in O

growth O
conditions O
compared O
to O
the O
field, O
so O
they O
might O
contribute O
to O
the O
plasticity O
of O
plant O
phenotypic O
responses. O
This O
includes O
factors O
such O
as O
temperature O

55 O
, O
humidity O
56 O

60 O
, O
other O

61 O
in O

as O
well O
as O
physiological O
changes O
during O
the O
growth O
and O

of O
A. O
chinensis O

may O
have O
an O
effect. O
In O
the O

elucidation O
of O
the O
role O
of O
the O
genetic O

regulating O
the O
observed O
tissue-specific O

will O
be O
helpful O
in O

the O

in O
the O

of O

Remarkably, O
a O
number O
of O
the O
QTLs O

The O
most O
elaborate O
dish O
was O
mushrooms O
with O
mole O
(a O
sauce O
prepared O
with O
many O
kinds O
of O
chillis) O
seasoned O
with O
wild O
plants O
such O
as O
jocoyole O
(Oxalis O
corniculata). O
However, O
simple O
recipes O
were O
preferred O
in O
which O
the O
flavour O
of O
the O
mushrooms O
stood O
out, O
so O
they O
were O
commonly O
prepared O
only O
with O
salt O
without O
any O
other O
seasoning O
or O
ingredient. O
The O
Wixaritari O
consumed O
Ustilago O
maydis O
as O
a O
food O
or O
as O
ceremonial O
drink, O
commonly O
called O
tsinari. O
According O
to O
Torres O
( O
2000 O
), O
tsinari O
is O
a O
drink O
(atole) O
made O
from O
the O
flour O
of O
white O
maize O
that O
is O
consumed O
for O
breakfast O
and, O
following O
Kindl O
( O
2003 O
), O
it O
is O
a O
bitter O
atole O
for O
ritual O
use. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
tsinari O
was O
found O
to O
be O
a O
maize O
drink O
containing O
U. O
maydis, O
known O
among O
the O
interviewees O
as O
atole O
negro O
(black O
atole), O
similar O
to O
the O
report O
of O
Villaseñor-Ibarra O
et O
al. O
( O
2018 O
; O
as O
“chinari”). O
It O
was O
made O
from O
flour O
of O
nixtamalized O
maize O
—that O
goes O
through O
a O
chemical O
process O
in O
alkali O
solutions O
that O
increases O
its O
nutritional O
value— O
cooked O
with O
water O
in O
a O
clay O
pot O
over O
a O
fire O
until O
the O
mixture O
boiled O
and O
thickened. O
Before O
the O
mixture O
boiled, O
U. O
maydis, O
previously O
ground O
on O
a O
metate, O
was O
added O
to O
provide O
a O
drink O
with O
a O
black O
colour. O
This O
was O
stored O
in O
the O
clay O
pot O
in O
which O
it O
had O
been O
prepared, O
covered O
with O
a O
cloth, O
and O
placed O
in O
a O
cool O
and O
dark O
place, O
commonly O
in O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
ground O
lined O
with O
clay. O
In O
some O
variants O
of O
this O
recipe, O
unrefined O
brown O
sugar O
(piloncillo) O
was O
added O
to O
reduce O
the O
characteristic O
bitter O
taste. O
Different O
conservation O
methods O
for O
mushrooms O
were O
documented. O
Mestizos O
often O
placed O
mushrooms O
in O
the O
refrigerator, O
although O
this O
only O
allowed O
them O
to O
be O
kept O
for O
1 O
week O
approximately. O
Others O
prepared O
mushrooms O
in O
different O
dishes O
and O
froze O
them O
for O
consumption O
later, O
often O
until O
December O
when O
family O
members O
who O
had O
migrated O
to O
the O
USA O
returned O
home O
for O
the O
patron O
saint O
festivals. O

Conversely, O
expression O
levels O
of O
CsCML18-2, O
CsCML38 O
and O
CsCML42 O
in O
roots O
were O
significantly O
higher O
than O
in O
leaves, O
stem O
and O
flower O
organs, O
suggesting O
that O
different O
CML O
gene O
members O
from O
different O
species O
have O
distinct O
expression O
levels O
in O
various O
tissues, O
and O
may O
function O
in O
different O
physiological O
processes. O
The O
diversified O
expression O
of O
these O
CsCML O
genes O
revealed O
that O
they O
might O
play O
significant O
role O
at O
different O
plant O
developmental O
stages. O
It O
is O
known O
that O
CML O
genes O
are O
involved O
in O
response O
to O
different O
environmental O
stresses O
and O
hormones. O
ABA O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
cellular O
signal O
transduction O
in O
response O
to O
abiotic O
stresses. O
It O
could O
regulate O
the O
expression O
of O
several O
ABA-responsive O
genes O
through O
cellular O
Ca O
2+ O
ion O
changes O
27 O
. O
Over O
expression O
of O
Oryza O
sativa O
multi-stress-responsive O
gene O
2 O
(OsMSR2), O
which O
was O
a O
novel O
CML O
gene, O
improved O
the O
drought O
and O
salt O
tolerance O
of O
plants O
via O
ABA-mediated O
pathways O
28 O
. O
Subsequently, O
another O
novel O
CML O
gene O
named O
OsDSR1 O
(Oryza O
sativa O
drought O
stress O
response-1) O
showed O
greater O
sensitivity O
to O
ABA O
during O
the O
development O
of O
plant O
29 O
. O
OsCML4 O
could O
improve O
drought O
tolerance O
by O
effectively O
scavenging O
of O
ROS O
in O
rice O
17 O
. O
In O
Arabidopsis, O
some O
studies O
have O
reported O
that O
AtCML24 O
was O
induced O
by O
cold O
and O
drought O
stress, O
suggest O
that O
AtCML24 O
might O
be O
involved O
in O
cold-related O
Ca O
2+ O
signals O
transduction O
30 O
. O
AtCML37, O
AtCML39 O
and O
AtCML38 O
were O
also O
in O
response O
to O
several O
stimulus-induced O
and O
developmental O
signalling O
pathways, O
including O
salt, O
drought, O
and O
ABA O
31 O
, O
while O
AtCML42 O
may O
function O
to O
increase O
resistance O
to O
pathogens O
32 O
. O
MtCML40 O
in O
Medicago O
truncatula O
was O
reported O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
salt, O
cold O
tolerance O
as O
well O
as O
ABA O
treatment O
33 O
. O
Altogether, O
accumulating O
evidence O
has O
demonstrated O
that O
CML O
proteins O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
Ca O
2+ O
signal O
transduction O
during O
plant O
growth O
and O
adaptation O
to O
abiotic O
stress. O
The O
transcriptional O
regulation O
analysis O
under O
abiotic O
stress O
and O

showed O
that O
the O
expression O

of O
CsCMLs O

in O

Furthermore, O

depended O
on O
the O

be O
due O

a O

due O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
other O
unidentified O
factor/s. O
Identity O
of O
these O
factors O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
further O
investigation O
and O
beyond O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
present O
study. O
Additionally, O
the O
activation O
differences O
between O
native O
R. O
arrhizus O
and O
the O
horse O
cyt O
c O
could O
be O
due O
to O
the O
variations O
in O
distribution O
of O
positive O
patches O
on O
the O
R. O
arrhizus O
cyt O
c O
surface, O
which O
are O
known O
to O
be O
critical O
for O
cyt O
c/Apaf-1 O
interaction. O
Cyt O
c O
and O
Apaf-1 O
interact O
through O
an O
extensive O
region. O
Many O
lysine O
residues O
(7, O
8, O
25, O
39 O
and O
72) O
spread O
across O
the O
surface O
of O
cyt O
c O
are O
known O
to O
be O
important O
for O
this O
interaction. O
Disruption O
of O
these O
residues O
by O
site O
directed O
mutagenesis O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
abolish O
or O
lower O
the O
ability O
of O
horse O
and O
human O
cytochrome O
to O
activate O
caspases O
[ O
25 O
, O

]. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
native O
R. O
arrhizus, O
the O
reduction O
in O
caspase-3 O
activation O
was O
seen O
when O
compared O
to O
horse O
cyt O
c. O
Sequence O
comparison O
with O
horse O
cyt O

revealed O
that O
in O
the O
native O
R. O
arrhizus O
cyt O
c O
two O
of O
these O
lysine O
residues O
(7 O
and O
25) O
are O
occupied O
by O
alanine O
(Fig. O
6 O
). O
We O
propose O
that O
these O
changes O
to O
hydrophobic O
non-polar O
groups O
(Ala) O
could O
decrease O
cyt O
c O
affinity O
for O
Apaf-1. O
The O
lower O
caspase-3 O
activation O
by O
the O
native O
R. O
arrhizus O
cyt O
c O
is O
a O
potential O
reflection O
of O
this O
effect. O
Indeed, O
these O
two O
lysine O
residues O
(7 O
and O
25) O
were O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
Apaf-1 O
binding, O
since O
a O
10–100 O
fold O
drop O
in O
caspase O
activity O
was O
observed O
by O
Yu O
et O
al. O
when O
these O
amino O

were O
mutated O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
Apaf-1 O
interacting O
residues O
in O
horse O
cyt O

The O
down-regulation O
of O
cathepsin O
and O
cystatin O
protein O
expression O
was O
associated O
with O
reduced O
expression O
of O
these O
enzymes O
at O
the O
gene O
level O
and O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
our O
previous O
results O
concerning O

of O

and O
Ctss O
in O
peritoneal O

isolated O
from O

and O
C57BL/6 O

[ O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
ECTV O
diminishes O
the O
expression O
levels O
of O
cathepsins O
and O
cystatins O
in O
order O
to O
perturb O
immune O
responses O
orchestrated O
by O
cDCs. O
ECTV O
infection O
impairs O
cathepsin O
activity O
in O
JAWS O
II O
cells O
Because O
ECTV O
infection O
down-regulates O
the O
expression O
of O
both O
cathpesins O
and O
their O
endogenous O
inhibitors O
cystatins, O
we O
further O
asked O
if O
a O
change O
occurs O
in O
the O
activity O
of O
cathepsin O
proteases O
following O
infection. O
To O
this O
extent, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
activity O
of O
cathepsins O
in O
cell O
lysates O
of O
JAWS O
II O
DCs O
during O
ECTV O
replication O
cycle. O
At O
early O
stages O
(4 O
hpi) O
of O
infection O
the O
activity O
of O
all O
analyzed O
cathepsins O
did O
not O
change O
compared O
to O
uninfected O
cells. O
At O
12 O
hpi O
the O
activity O
of O
cathepsin O
L O
was O
significantly O
(p O
≤ O
0.05) O
decreased, O
whereas O
the O
activity O
of O
cathpesins O
B O
and O
S O
remained O
unchanged O
compared O
to O
the O
control O
cells O
(Fig. O
4 O
). O
However, O
at O
24 O
hpi O
with O
ECTV O
the O
activity O
of O
all O
analyzed O
cathepsins O
(B, O
L O
and O
S) O
was O
significantly O
reduced O
compared O
to O
uninfected O
cells O
(Fig. O
4 O
). O
Our O
data O
clearly O
indicate O
that O
during O
later O
stages O
of O
ECTV O
infection, O
together O
with O
decreased O
mRNA O
expression O
and O
protein O
content, O
also O
the O
cathepsin O
activity O
diminishes O
in O
cDCs. O

This O
relationship O
of O
‘reflectance O
follows O
function’ O
firstly O
provides O
the O
physical O
basis O
for O
retrieving O
differences O
in O
plant O
functions O
by O
means O
of O
optical O
Earth O
observation O
data, O
and O
underlines O
the O
potential O
to O
track O
Earth’s O
functional O
diversity. O
Secondly, O
linking O
plant O
functions O
and O
strategies O
with O
radiative O
transfer O
provides O
a O
different O
and O
additional O
perspective O
on O
how O
environmental O
factors O
and O
biotic O
interactions O
shape O
plant O
functional O
diversity. O
Why O
does O
reflectance O
of O
plant O
canopies O
follow O
function? O
Our O
results O
showed O
strong O
links O
between O
optically O
relevant O
plant O
traits O
and O
the O
two O
schemes O
used O
as O
baselines O
for O
plant O
functioning, O
i.e. O
the O
Leaf O
Economic O
Spectrum O
(LES) O
and O
CSR O
plant O
strategies. O
Originally O
the O
LES O
has O
been O
captured O
through O
leaf O
lifespan, O
LMA, O
photosynthetic O
capacity, O
dark O
respiration O
rate, O
nitrogen O
and O
phosphorus O
content O
3 O
. O
Indeed, O
variation O
of O
observed O
LMA O
showed O
an O
strong O
correspondence O
to O
the O
LES, O
whereas O
we O
also O
found O
significant O
correlations O
with O
pigment O
mass, O
and O
pigment O
area O
, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
directly O
linked O
to O
photosynthetic O
capacity O
and O
nitrogen O
content O
35 O
. O
Our O
results O
further O
suggest O
that O
pigment O
content O
(pigment O
area O
) O
generally O
increases O
with O
leaf O
lifespan, O
whereas O
the O
concentration O
of O
pigments O
(pigment O
mass O
) O
decreases. O
Thus, O
plant O
investment O
in O
leaf O
tissue O
proportionally O
outweigh O
investment O
in O
leaf O
pigment, O
which O
can O
be O
explained O
as O
with O
increasing O
chlorophyll O
content O
light O
absorption O
follows O
a O
saturating O
curve, O
since O
chloroplasts O
become O
increasingly O
stacked O
in O
the O
palisade O
cells O
resulting O
in O
intraleaf O
shading O
36 O
– O
38 O
. O
Accordingly, O
plants O
with O
short O
leaf O
lifespan O
invest O
fewer O
pigment O
to O
optimise O
energy O
revenue. O
However, O
the O
LES O
reflects O
only O
one O
primary O
dimension O
of O
plant O
functioning, O
ranging O
from O
a O
quick O
to O
slow O
return O
on O
leaf O
resource O
investments. O
Accordingly, O
the O
canopy-structure-related O
traits O
(LAI, O
LMA O
canopy O
, O
ALA, O
fAPAR O
or O
APAR O
cum O
) O
showed O
no O
significant O
correspondence O
to O
the O
LES, O
suggestingthat O
these O
traits O
are O
indeed O
related O
to O
other O
functional O
axes O
(Fig. O
3 O
). O

In O

chromosomal O
translocations O
can O
occur O
as O

(reviewed O

Arguably O
some O
of O
the O

are O
a O
result O

the O

The O

not O
known, O
though O
many O

(reviewed O

This O

stresses O
the O
importance O

with O
early O
appropriate O
antibiotic O
regimes O
in O
all O
cases O
of O

[ O

In O
our O
study, O
the O
risk O

for O
inappropriate O
antibiotic O

were O
mainly O
related O
to O
low O
APACHE O

or O
a O
low O

and O
a O

thus, O
a O
need O
for O
improvement O
in O
the O
early O

of O

in O
patients O

This O

also O
illustrates O
the O
importance O
of O
prompt O
re-establishment O
of O
haemodynamic O
stability, O
tissue O

and O
cellular O

Achievement O
of O
the O
SSC O

of O
a O

These O

are O
consistent O
with O
previous O

(6–24 O

where O
the O

This O
probably O
reflects O
therapeutic O
efforts O
to O
restore O

in O
patients O
with O
prolonged O

not O

In O
Mexico, O
the O
species O
of O
the O
Amanita O

are O
among O
the O
most O
liked O
mushrooms, O
similar O
to O
the O
preferences O
of O
the O
Wixaritari O
(Burrola-Aguilar O

Alonso-Aguilar O

The O

Agaricus O

the O
most O

also O
called O
corralitos O
(Jiménez O

). O
The O
frequency O
of O

is O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
the O

In O
fact, O
the O
colonization O
abilities O
of O
ATCC O
11845 O
and O
isolates O
were O
confirmed, O
which O
again O
suggested O
that O
both O
the O
background O
of O
the O
strains O
and O
the O
rpoB O
mutation O
could O
have O
a O
significant O
impact O
on O
the O

and O
pathogenicity. O
Among O
the O
spontaneous O
rpoB O
mutants O
from O
Acinetobacter O

ATCC O
17978, O
the O
mutants O
carrying O

and O
540 O
all O
showed O
phenotypes O
of O
impaired O
movement O
and O
reduced O
virulence O
[ O
34 O
]. O
The O
transcriptome O
information O
of O
the O
mutants O
showed O
that O
the O
expression O
levels O
of O
the O
four O
coding O
transporters O
and O
metabolic O
enzymes O
in O
the O
mutants O
were O
directly O
related O
to O
the O
above O
phenotypes. O
The O
virulence O
genes O
of O
the O
mutant O
strain O
in O
this O
study O
were O
worth O
exploring O
at O
the O
transcription O
level. O
Although O
both O
the O
parental O
and O
mutant O
strains O
were O
cleared O
at O
a O
very O
low O
level, O
the O
decrease O
in O
the O
viable O
count O
of O
the O
parental O
strain O
within O
24 O
h O
was O
gradual, O
and O
the O
number O
of O

was O
gradually O
reduced O
from O
10 O
3 O
CFU O
to O
10 O
1 O
CFU. O
However, O
there O
were O
two O
mutant O
strains O
that O
were O
both O
at O
very O
low O
levels. O
In O
particular, O
its O
colonization O
could O
not O
complete O
within O
the O
trachea, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
mutant O
strain O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
able O
to O
fight O
clearance O
from O
the O
immune O
system. O
Studies O
in O
E. O

Δlon O
strains O
suggested O
that O
rpoB O
mutants O
could O
reduce O
the O
expression O
of O
capsular O
polysaccharide O
synthesis O
genes O
in O
this O
strain. O
Capsular O
polysaccharides O
could O
help O
the O
cells O
to O
fight O
immune O
mechanisms O
in O

[ O

]. O
Considering O
the O
crucial O
role O
of O
RNA O
polymerase O
in O
transcription, O
studying O
transcriptome O
changes O
in O
mutants O
would O
provide O
useful O
information. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
ability O
of O
mutants O
to O
resist O
hydrogen O
peroxide O
and O
NO O
was O
decreased O
in O
an O
in O

sensitivity O
experiment. O
This O
result O
also O
supported O
the O
results O
of O
colonization O
experiments O
in O
vivo. O
Both O
active O
oxygen O
and O
reactive O
nitrogen O
in O
vivo O
were O
the O
environmental O
pressures O
that O
the O
bacteria O
would O
encounter. O
The O
defense O
against O
oxidative O
stress O
was O
crucial O
for O
the O
survival O
of O
bacteria O
in O
the O
body O
[ O
36 O
]. O
So O
far, O
the O
rpoB O
mutant O
has O
not O
been O
characterized O
in O
detail O
and O
may O
lack O
sufficient O
attention. O

Ear11 O
belongs O
to O
a O
family O
of O
eosinophil O
associated O
RNases, O
including O
eosinophil-derived O
neurotoxin O
(EDN) O
and O
eosinophil O
cationic O
protein O
(ECP). O
Both O
EDN O
and O

have O
been O
shown O
to O
possess O
antiviral O
activities O
against O
a O
range O
of O
single-stranded O
RNA O
viruses O
including O
RSV O
[ O
33 O
– O
35 O
]. O
Thus, O
these O
data O
cumulatively O
suggest O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
Ear11 O
in O
response O
to O
a O
Th2 O
environment O
provides O
the O
protective O
(i.e., O
antiviral) O
effects O
observed O
in O
the O

and O
OOR O
groups. O
Ongoing O
studies O
in O
this O
laboratory O
with O
Ear11 O

are O
expected O
to O
resolve O
this O
question. O
Severe O
RSV O
infections O
(i.e., O
requiring O
hospitalization) O
during O
infancy O
are O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
subsequent O
wheeze O
and O
pulmonary O
dysfunction O
including O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
asthma O
in O
later O
life O
[ O
6 O
, O
11 O
, O
12 O
, O
36 O
– O
41 O
]. O
One O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
RSV O
bronchiolitis O
is O
simply O
more O
severe O
in O
atopic O
individuals. O
In O
fact, O
our O
studies O
demonstrated O
that O
interactions O
between O
RSV O
infection O
and O
allergen-induced O
immune O
responses O
exacerbate O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
and O
airway O
physiology. O
Furthermore, O
the O
synergism O
between O
RSV O
and O
allergen O
leads O
to O
long-term O
pulmonary O
consequences O
such O
as O
airway O
remodeling O
and O
may O
explain O
progressive O
lung O
disease O
in O
humans. O
An O
alternative O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
severe O
RSV O
infections O
during O
infancy O
are O
a O
predisposing O
factor O
for O
the O
development O
of O
airway O
inflammatory O
disease O
states, O
such O
as O
asthma. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
RSV O
infection O
during O
infancy, O
when O
the O
immune O
system O
is O
still O
developing O
and O
is O
in O
a O
Th2-skewed O
state, O
initiates O
a O
Th2 O
polarized O
primary O
immune O
response O
and O
subsequently O
a O
Th2 O
polarized O
memory O
response O
to O
RSV O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Such O
a O
response O
may O
even O
be O
heightened O
in O
atopic O
individuals. O
Although O
compelling O
evidence O
in O
support O
of O
the O
later O
hypothesis O
comes O
from O
recently O
published O
data O
[ O
13 O
], O
we O
did O
not O
find O
evidence O
of O
this O
in O
our O
studies O
using O
weanling O
mice. O

In O
this O
set O
of O
samples, O
the O
sum O
mass O
of O
all O
contaminants O
was O
9.1 O
± O
2.0 O
attograms, O
which O
suggests O
that O
samples O
of O
less O
than O
10 O
ag O
may O
be O
overwhelmed O
by O
contamination O
bias O
and O
thus O
would O
be O
unusable. O
This O
measurement O
incorporates O
only O
high-quality O
microbial O
reads O
and O
could O
be O
adapted O
to O
include O
other O
contaminating O
reads O
such O
as O
human-derived O
or O
low-quality O
microbial O
reads O
as O
needed. O
Of O
note, O
statistical O
confidence O
in O
the O
ability O
to O
estimate O
the O
molar O
contribution O
of O
each O
contaminating O
taxa O
actually O
increases O
when O
the O
experimental O

samples O
that O
vary O
over O

The O

thus O
protects O
the O
autograft O
during O
the O

Since O
allogenic O

slowly O

it O
may O
serve O
as O
a O
scaffold O
to O
promote O
autologous O
dermal O

[ O

, O

]. O
The O
ideal O
particulate O
skin O
cover O
is O
allogenic O
skin, O
but O
it O
is O
difficult O
and O
costly O
to O
obtain. O
The O
next O
best O
option O
is O
fresh O
pigskin, O
but O
immune O
rejection O
and O
biosafety O
are O
major O
problems. O
Dermal O
substitutes O
such O
as O
Pelnac O
(Gunze O

have O
therapeutic O
potential O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
full-thickness O
skin O
wounds O
and O
enhance O
the O
quality O
of O
wound O

[ O

Pelnac O
consists O
of O
two O
layers: O
a O
porcine O
tendon-derived O
atelocollagen O
sponge O
layer O
and O
silicon O
film O
[ O

]; O
it O
serves O
as O
scaffolding O
for O
the O
ingrowth O
of O
fibroblasts O
and O
endothelial O
cells, O
which O
contribute O
to O
neodermis O
formation O
and O
thereby O
improve O
wound O
healing O
[ O
11 O
, O
12 O
]. O
However, O
at O
present, O
the O
application O
of O
artificial O
dermis O
requires O
a O
second O
skin O
graft O
operation, O
which O
increases O
patients’ O
discomfort. O
We O
speculated O
that O
since O
artificial O
dermis O
mimics O
the O
scaffold O
structure O
of O
allogenic O
skin, O
it O
can O
be O
used O
as O
an O
overlay O
of O
micrografts O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
as O
allogenic O
skin O
to O
repair O
the O
wound O
in O
a O
single O
operation, O
while O
also O
promoting O
dermal O
and O
epidermal O
regeneration O
and O
collagen O
organization. O
To O
investigate O
the O
above O
possibility, O
in O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
used O
Pelnac O
overlaid O
on O
minced O
split-thickness O
skin O
grafts O
to O
repair O
full-thickness O
skin O

in O
a O

model. O
The O
effectiveness O
of O
this O
treatment O
method O
was O
assessed O
by O

the O
rate O

Kim O

In O

a O

the O

after O

in O
the O
rcd1 O

this O

that O
reaction O

closing. O
In O
contrast, O
other O

an O

(Kim O

). O
Our O
results O

that O
hormonal O

has O
affected O
photosynthesis O

ein4 O
mutants O
had O
lower O
activity O
of O
these O

plants. O
Gas O

depends O
on O
various O
factors, O
e.g., O
on O
leaf O
morphology/anatomy O
or O
sensitivity O
to O
light O
conditions, O
which O
could O
be O
different O
in O
mutants O

Wounding O
caused O
a O
decrease O

after O

injury, O
mainly O
in O
wild-type O
plants O
(but O
also O
in O

(Fig. O

). O
Microarray O
data O
indicate O
that O
several O
photosynthetic O
genes O
are O
repressed O
by O
wounding O
in O
A. O
thaliana, O
probably O
via O
ethylene/ethylene-responsive O
pathways O
(Delessert O
et O
al. O

). O
Respiration O
significantly O
increased O

stress O
in O
wild-type O
or O
after O
2 O

in O

in O

a O

was O
observed O
in O
all O

Introduction O
Flaviviruses O
comprise O
a O
number O
of O
important O
human O
pathogens O
that O
are O
transmitted O
to O
their O
vertebrate O
hosts O
either O
by O
mosquitoes O
(yellow O
fever, O
dengue, O
Zika, O
West O
Nile, O
and O
Japanese O
encephalitis O
viruses) O
or O
by O
ticks O
(tick-borne O
encephalitis O
and O
Powassan O
viruses). O
Explosive O
outbreaks O
and O
dramatic O
expansions O
of O
endemic O
regions O
have O
been O
documented O
in O
the O
recent O
past O
for O
Zika, O
West O

(WN), O
and O
dengue O
viruses O
(Den), O
underlining O
the O
impact O
of O
flaviviruses O
as O

pathogens. O
1 O
– O

All O
flaviviruses O
are O
antigenically O
related O
and O
can O
induce O
broadly O
flavivirus O
cross-reactive O
antibodies; O
cross-protection, O
however, O
is O
not O
observed O
among O
distantly O
related O
flaviviruses. O

In O
contrast, O
cross-reactive O
antibodies O
may O
even O
have O
a O
disease-enhancing O
effect O
during O
a O
subsequent O
exposure O
with O
a O
different O
flavivirus. O

In O
general, O
the O
immunological O
memory O
to O
cross-reactive O
antigenic O
sites O
and O
the O
formation O
of O
immune-complexes O
can O
modulate O
the O
antibody O
response O
in O
sequential O
infections O
or O
immunizations O
with O
antigenically O

In O

we O
aimed O
to O
develop O
the O
capability O
to O
measure O
metabolic O

in O
a O

A O

critical O
metabolic O

encompassing O
rate-limiting O

(Table O

and O
phenotypic O

The O

were O
optimized O
and O
validated O
based O
on O
antibody O

and O

(Supplementary O

Using O
the O

cellular O

To O

Results O
in O
recent O
decades O
suggest O
that O
apoptosis O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
both O
establishment O
and O
clearance O
of O
fungal O
infections O
[ O
3 O
]. O
In O
response O
to O
fungal O
infections, O
the O
oxidative O
burst O
by O
host O
immune O
cells O
could O
help O
in O
infection O
clearance O
by O
triggering O
apoptosis O
in O
the O
fungus O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
Also, O
pathogen-induced O
apoptosis O
in O
host O
immune O
cells O
could O
help O
the O
pathogen O
to O
establish O
the O
infection O
[ O
6 O
]. O
Thus, O
the O
success O
of O
an O
infection O
partly O
depends O
on O
the O
outcome O
of O
such O
host O
pathogen O
interactions. O
It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
extracts O
from O
the O
filamentous O
fungus O
could O
induce O
apoptosis O
in O
human O
cells O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
], O
but O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
protein/factor O
responsible O
for O
the O
induction O
of O
apoptosis O
remains O
unknown. O
In O
recent O
decades, O
it O
has O
also O
been O
established O
that O
in O
many O
organisms O
cyt O
c O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
apoptosis O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
During O
apoptosis, O
cyt O
c O
is O
released O
from O
the O
mitochondria O
into O
the O
cytoplasm O
and O
binds O
to O
apoptosis O
protease-activating O
factor-1 O
(Apaf-1) O
thus O
triggering O
a O
caspase O
activation O
cascade O
[ O
8 O
]. O
For O
example, O
in O
humans, O
cyt O
c O
can O
activate O
caspase-3 O
in O
cell-free O
activation O
assay O
[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
first O
evidence O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
apoptosis O
in O
fungi O
came O
from O
the O
study O
by O
Medeo O
et O
al. O
of O
a O
Saccharomyces O
cerevisiae O
mutant O
that O
showed O
signs O
of O
apoptosis O
[ O
10 O
]. O
Since O
then, O
many O
homologous O
mammalian O
apoptotic O
proteins O
were O
discovered O
in O
budding O
yeast O
[ O
11 O
]. O
In O
an O
important O
finding, O
using O
deletion O
mutants O
which O
were O
unable O
to O
produce O
functional O
cyt O
c, O
Silva O
et O
al. O
presented O
the O
first O
evidence O
that O
cyt O
c O
is O
involved O
in O
hyperosmotic O
stress O
induced O
yeast O
apoptosis O
[ O
12 O
]. O
However, O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
role O
cyt O
c O
plays O
in O
apoptosis O
of O
filamentous O
fungi O
like O
R. O
arrhizus O
remains O
unknown. O

Primary O
peritonitis O
can O
be O
caused O
by O
infection O
with O
Enterobacteriaceae O
(e.g., O
Escherichia B-PATH

Klebsiella O
spp.), O
Streptococcus B-PATH
pneumonia, I-PATH
and O
Enterococcus O
spp.; O
however, O
it O
is O
rarely O
associated O
with O
Streptococcus B-PATH
pyogenes, I-PATH
which O
usually O
causes O
pharyngitis, O
erysipelas, O
and O
tonsillitis. O
Necrotizing O
fasciitis O
is O
a O
severe O
infection O
due O
to O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes, I-PATH
which O
has O
a O
high O
mortality. O
This O
infection O
generally O
occurs O
in O
the O
extremities O
around O
the O
gate O
of O
bacterial O
invasion O
in O
the O
skin O
such O
as O
trauma O
and O

It O
is O
very O
rare O
to O
develop O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
secondary O
to O
primary O
peritonitis O
by O
the O
same O
bacteria O
species. O
Recent O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
carrying O
mutations O
in O

can O
cause O
severe O

infections. O
In O
this O

we O
describe O
the O
investigation O
and O
management O
of O
a O
55-year-old O

A O
previously O
healthy O
55-year-old O

intravenous O
acetaminophen O
was O
used O
for O
abdominal O

Her O
nausea O
was O
improved O
after O

so O
she O
did O
not O
take O

Her O
vital O

and O
C-reactive O

An O
abdominal O

examination O
showed O
a O
thickened O

of O
the O
small O

Moreover, O
many O
enzymes, O

Diarrhea O
and O
gut O
microbiome O
disorders O
interact O
as O
both O
cause O
and O
effect. O
Diarrhea O
can O
disrupt O
the O
balance O
of O
the O
gut O
microenvironment. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
invasion O
of O
exogenous O
pathogenic O
microorganisms O
and O
the O
imbalance O
of O
intestinal O
microbes O
can O
lead O
to O
diarrhea O
[ O

]. O
For O
example, O
the O
invasion O
of O
some O
pathogenic O
bacteria O
including O
Shigella, O
Salmonella O
and O
Klebsiella O
[ O

abundance O
changes O
of O
intestinal O
parasitic O
microbes O
include O
Candida B-PATH

and O
Aeromonas O
can O
induce O
diarrhea O
[ O

25 O
]. O
Chemotherapy O
has O
been O
widely O
used O
in O
the O
clinic O
as O
an O
effective O
therapy O
for O
colorectal O
cancer, O
but O
diarrhea O
caused O
by O
chemotherapeutic O
drugs O
often O
affects O
the O
implementation O
of O
chemotherapy O
regimens O
[ O

]. O
Many O
probiotics O
and O
antibiotics O
play O
a O
positive O
role O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
infectious O
diarrhea O
by O
regulating O
the O
gut O

[ O
27 O

]. O
The O
study O

Discussion O
Our O
study O
using O
a O
novel O
in O
vivo O
micro-OCT O
imaging O
technique O
suggested O
that O
the O
measurement O
of O
central O
corneal O
thickness O
and O
scar O
thickness O
were O
generally O
of O
good O
agreement O
with O
AS-OCT O
images, O
with O
at O
least O
95% O
of O
measurements O
and O
differences O
within O
the O
95% O
prediction O
intervals O
and O
95% O
LOA, O
respectively. O
We O
found O
that O
the O
images O
acquired O
were O
able O
to O
discern O
the O
five O
basic O
corneal O
layers. O
When O
imaging O
the O
irr-PTK O
injured O
eyes, O
the O
scar O
tissue O
was O
also O
detected O
prominently. O
For O
example, O
the O
mean O
central O
corneal O
(80.2 O
± O
11.28 O
μm) O
and O
scar O
thickness O
(9.9 O
± O
2.28 O
μm) O
in O
mice O
cornea O
determined O
by O
the O
micro-OCT O
showed O
good O
agreement O
with O
immunofluorescent O
histology O
measurements O
of O
(82 O
± O
5.5 O
μm) O
CCT O
and O
(9.2 O
± O
3.5 O
μm) O
scar O
obtained O
at O
Week O
2 O
follow-up. O
The O
resolution O
of O
distinction O
of O
the O
corneal O
layers O
in O
the O
processed O
micro-OCT O
acquired O
images, O
are O
comparable O
to O
the O
histology O
results, O
suggesting O
the O
potential O
for O
OCT O
to O
produce O
high O
resolution O
images O
of O
specific O
corneal O
layers O
non-invasively. O
When O
comparing O
the O
micro-OCT O
images O
with O
the O
AS-OCT O
imaging O
modality, O
the O
former O
performs O
better O
than O
AS-OCT O
in O
prominently O
displaying O
the O
scar O
distribution O
and O
intensity. O
However, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
the O
limitations O
of O
the O
in O
vivo O
micro-OCT O
used O
in O
this O
pilot O
study. O
One O
of O
the O
main O
problems O
encountered O
was O
the O
widespread O
presence O
of O
motion O
artefacts. O
The O
reason O
behind O
this O
could O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
heart O
beat O
rate O
(310–840 O
beats O
per O
minute) O
of O
the O
mice O
used O
herein, O
which O
was O
much O
higher O
than O
the O
image O
acquisition O
speed O
of O
60 O
frames O
per O
second. O
In O
view O
of O
this, O
future O
outlook O
for O
this O
area O
of O
study O
may O
involve O
improving O
the O
image O
acquisition O
speed. O
Moreover, O
the O
image O
acquisition O
for O
the O
micro-OCT O
is O
longer O
(estimated O
1–2 O
minutes O
per O
image) O
compared O
to O
IVCM O
(15–30 O
seconds) O
and O
AS-OCT O
(5 O
seconds). O

To O
validate O
this O
finding, O
SsrB O
c O
was O
overexpressed O
from O
pBAD-ssrB O
c O
in O
Escherichia O
coli O
KB3, O
purified O
and O
used O
for O
gel O
mobility O
shift O
assays O
(GMSAs). O
The O
promoter O
of O
sseA O
served O
as O
positive O
control O
and O
that O
of O
argS O
as O
a O
competitive O
DNA O
17 O
, O
41 O
. O
The O
GMSAs O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
7B O
demonstrate O
that O
SsrB O
c O
binds O
P O
rssR O
at O
approximately O
the O
same O
molar O
ratio O
as O
the O
positive O
control O
P O
sseA O
. O
The O
specificity O
of O
this O
interaction O
was O
further O
demonstrated O
by O
an O
additional O
bandshift O
experiment O
in O
which O
SsrB O
c O

In O
addition O
to O

lipid O

from O
conidia O
to O
appressorium O
is O
also O
necessary O
for O
building O
up O
turgor O
pressure O
13 O
. O
To O
this O
end, O
we O
determined O
whether O
the O
upstream O
lipid O
body O
mobilization O
was O
altered O
in O
mutant O
etfb O
− O
by O
staining O
with O
the O

and O
monitoring O
the O
movement O
and O
localization O
of O
Bodipy-labeled O
lipid O
bodies O
by O

microscopy. O
Our O
results O
showed O
that O
there O
was O
no O
difference O
between O
mutant O
etfb O
− O
and O
Guy11 O
in O
the O
mobilization O
and O
movement O
of O
lipid O
bodies O
into O
the O
appressorium O
( O
Fig. O
S6 O
), O
suggesting O
that O
the O
appressorial O
turgor O
defect O
in O
mutant O
was O
not O
due O
to O
alterations O
in O
lipid O
mobilization. O
To O
further O
understand O
the O
mechanism O
of O
turgor O
reduction O
in O
the O
mutants, O
we O
examined O
the O
appressorial O
melanin O
layer O
which O
is O
necessary O
for O
turgor O
generation O
by O
preventing O
glycerol O
from O
leaking O
out O
7 O
. O
Appressoria O
were O
induced O
on O
rice O
sheaths O
for O
24 O
h O
and O
processed O
for O
transmission O
electron O
microscopy. O
As O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
5b O
, O
the O
melanin O
layer O
of O
mutant O
etfb O
− O
appressorium O
was O
obviously O
thinner O
than O
that O
of O
Guy11 O
strain. O
Therefore, O
we O
concluded O
that O
the O
low O
turgor O
pressure O
in O
mutant O
likely O
resulted O
from O
an O
impaired O
appressorial O
melanin O
layer. O
ETF O
mutant O
etfb O
− O
is O
more O
sensitive O
to O
host O
oxidative O
stress O
As O
described O
above, O
the O
reduced O
turgor O
pressure O
was O
responsible O
for O
the O
penetration O
defect O
in O
the O
mutants. O
However, O
a O
few O
of O
mutant O
appressoria O
could O
still O
penetrate O
but O
were O
limited O
in O
invasive O
hyphae O
growth. O
Moreover, O
mutant O
etfb O
− O
remained O
non-pathogenic O
even O
on O
wounded O
host O
leaves O
( O
Fig. O
6a O
), O
suggesting O
that O
the O
defects O
went O
beyond O
reduced O
turgor O
pressure O
and O
penetration. O

Thus, O
instead O
of O
analyzing O
the O
common O
pathogens O
in O
the O
diarrheic O
infant O
group, O
the O
potential O
pathogens O
were O
determined O
by O
analyzing O
each O
individual O
diarrheic O
infant. O
We O
designed O
the O
following O
two-step O
procedures O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
potential O
pathogens O
from O
individual O
diarrheic O
infants. O
First, O
the O
OTU O
were O
filtered O
by O
LEfSe O
analysis, O
and O
only O
the O
OTUs O
that O
were O
more O
present O
in O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
diarrheic O
individuals O
than O
in O
the O
healthy O
controls O
and O
that O
had O
value O
of O
LDA O
&gt; O
3 O
were O
picked O
out. O
This O
step O
was O
actually O
used O
to O
find O
biomarker O
OTUs O
in O
each O
diarrheic O
individual. O
Second, O
from O
the O
filtered O
OTUs O
of O
the O
first O
step, O
two O
kinds O
of O
OTUs O
were O
focused O
on: O
the O
OTUs O
that O
can O
be O
annotated O
to O
a O
known O
pathogen O
or O
opportunistic O
pathogen O
and O
the O
OTUs O
that O
were O
less O
than O
0.5% O
abundant O
in O
each O
healthy O
individual O
and O
more O
than O
2.5% O
abundant O
in O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
diarrheic O
individuals. O
The O
results O

To O

we O

as O

This O
was O
quantitatively O

by O

about O

(Fig. O

The O
severe O

was O
related O

these O

the O

Alleles O

gradually O
increase O

Like O
Darwin’s O
observations, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
observe O
adaptations O
without O
understanding O
the O
underlying O
mechanisms. O
Here, O
we O
use O
the O
analogy O
of O
a O
black O
box O
from O
which O
the O
content O
remains O
hidden O
while O
the O
obvious O
effects O
of O
this O
content O
are O
nonetheless O
clear O
and O
visible. O
Moreover, O
the O
route O
does O
not O
beforehand O
qualify O
certain O
traits O
thought O
to O
be O
of O
advantage, O
but O
just O
follows O
nature O
to O
the O
outcome O
of O
survival O
and O
reproduction. O
Inside O
the O
black O
box, O
alleles O
associated O
with O
a O
successful O
phenotype O
are O
conserved O
and O
will O
persist O
in O
the O
next O
generation. O
Natural O
selection O
is O
therefore O
‘inclusive’ O
as O
it O
maintains O
genetic O
diversity O
by O
keeping O
all O
surviving O
phenotypes O
in O
the O
black O
box, O
including O
possibly O
rare O
alleles O
beneficial O
for O
resistance O
to O
parasites O
and O
pathogens O
(Delaplane O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
Targeted O
selective O
breeding O
programs, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
are O
by O
definition O
reducing O
genetic O
diversity O
by O
selecting O
from O
the O
surviving O
phenotypes O
only O
those O
of O
their O
preference O
of O
chosen O
traits, O
thereby O
potentially O
excluding O
many O
of O
the O
phenotypes O
despite O
their O
shown O
capability O
of O
survival O
(Uzunov O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
DBBB O
selection O
follows O
the O
natural O
seasonal O
reproduction O
cycle O
of O
honey O
bee O
colonies, O
mimicking O
swarming O
by O
splitting O
colonies. O
Consequently, O
the O
population O
not O
only O
preserves O
its O
genetic O
diversity, O
but O
also O
its O
associated O
diverse O
biome O
(both O
favourable O
and O
unfavourable O
associated O
organisms; O
bacteria, O
yeasts, O
fungi, O
viruses, O

etc.,) O
which O
fosters O
development O
of O
less O
virulent O
host–parasite O
relationships O
(Neumann O
and O
Blacquière O
2017 O
; O
Blacquière O
and O
Panziera O

). O
This O
also O
precludes O
a O
next O
generation O
queen O
being O
confronted O
with O
a O
completely O
new O
biotic O
environment O
(colony O
plus O
biota). O
Vice O
versa O
it O
prevents O
colony O
offspring O
(plus O
biota) O
being O
exposed O
to O
a O
foreign O
young O
queen O
(queen O
+ O
possible O
biota). O
Below O
we O
describe O
the O
practical O
principles O
and O
methods O
used O
in O
the O
approach, O
which O
we O
actively O
advocate O
to O
use O
wherever O
possible O
in O
a O
well-structured O
manner. O

Most O
of O
the O

processes. O
Because O
we O

not O
conduct O

the O

we O
are O
currently O

thus O

in O
the O

Discussion O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
applied O
both O
dissection O
and O
a O
cell O
separation O
method O
to O
enrich O
the O
bacterial O
fraction O
of O
springtail O
samples, O
with O
the O
aim O
of O
increasing O
the O
proportion O
of O
bacterial O
reads O
after O
sequencing. O
The O
cell O
separation O
method O
was O
developed O
by O
Engel O
et O
al. O
22 O
and O
it O
was O
more O
effective O
than O
dissection O
when O
applied O
to O
F. O
candida. O
Although O
dissection O
normally O
helps O
to O
effectively O
target O
the O
microbial O
component O
23 O
, O
this O
may O
be O
more O
complicated O
in O
microarthropods O
such O
as O
springtails O
because O
of O
their O
small O
size. O
A O
combination O
of O
dissection O
and O
cell O
separation O
method O
proved O
to O
be O
most O
effective O
in O
increasing O
the O
proportion O
of O
prokaryotic O
reads. O
Still, O
more O
than O
97% O
of O
the O
reads O
in O
any O
sample O
belonged O
to O
the O
host O
Folsomia O
candida: O
recovery O
of O
genetic O
material O
from O
symbiotic O
microorganisms O
can O
be O
problematic O
in O
microhabitats O
such O
as O
insect O
guts, O
due O
to O
the O
much O
higher O
abundance O
of O
host O
DNA O
24 O
. O
Wolbachia O
can O
dominate O
the O
bacterial O
population O
in O
F. O
candida O
25 O
. O
By O
discarding O
organs O
containing O
high O
amounts O
of O
Wolbachia O
(brain O
and O
ovaries), O
dissection O
should O
be O
effective O
in O
reducing O
the O
occurrence O
of O
the O
endosymbiont O
in O
the O
samples. O
Indeed, O
sample O
FC3 O
(consisting O
of O
guts O
obtained O
through O
dissection) O
had O
the O
lowest O
proportion O
of O
Wolbachia O
reads. O
Cell O

is O
also O
expected O
to O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
Wolbachia O

in O
the O
samples. O

Meanwhile, O
the O

Introduction O
Dementia O
is O
a O
syndrome O
that O
affects O
memory O
and O
other O
cognitive O
functions O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
it O
interferes O
with O
daily O
function. O
There O
are O
many O
conditions O
that O
can O
cause O
dementia, O
including O
neurodegenerative O
disorders O
[e.g. O
Alzheimer’s O
disease O
(AD) O
and O
Parkinson’s O
disease O
(PD)], O
cerebrovascular O
disease, O
brain O
injury, O
and O
certain O
infections. O
AD O
is O
the O
most O
prevalent O
neurodegenerative O
disorder O
and O
the O
leading O
cause O
of O
dementia O
worldwide, O
accounting O
for O
approximately O
60%–70% O
of O
all O
cases O
(Irizarry, O
2001 O
; O
Fratiglioni, O
2001 O
). O
AD O
is O
a O
highly O
incapacitating O
disorder, O
progressing O
from O
minor O
memory O
problems O
to O
a O
complete O
loss O
of O
mental O
functions O
and O
in O
the O
long O
run, O
resulting O
in O
death. O
The O
symptoms O
of O
AD O
are O
caused O
by O
a O
progressive O
loss O
of O
cholinergic O
function O
due O
to O
neuronal O
cell O
death O
in O
the O
hippocampus O
cerebral O
cortex O
and O
different O
regions O
of O
the O
brain O
which O
regulate O
thought O
process O
and O
memory. O
Furthermore, O
the O
neuropathological O
hallmarks O
of O
AD O
consist O
of O
two O
kinds O
of O
protein O
aggregates, O
amyloid O
beta O
(Aβ) O
plaques O
and O
hyper-phosphorylated O
tangles O
of O
tau-protein. O
Aβ O
is O
a O
transmembrane O
protein O
which O
has O
no O
known O
function, O
which O
is O
constitutively O
cleaved O
into O
peptides O
during O
the O
metabolic O
functions O
of O
the O
cell O
(Haass O
et O
al., O
1992 O
). O
However, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
overproduction O
(or O
impaired O
clearance), O
Aβ O
aggregates O
into O
extracellular O
oligomers, O
fibrils O
and O
eventually, O
plaques O
(Masters O
et O
al., O
1985 O
). O
Whereas, O
tau O
is O
an O
intracellular O
microtubule O
binding O
protein O
which, O
when O
hyper-phosphorylated, O
results O
in O
the O
disassembly O
of O
microtubules O
and O
thus O
leads O
to O
the O
impediment O
axonal O
transport O
and O
compromises O
neuronal O
and O
synaptic O
functions O
(Iqbal O
et O
al., O
2005 O
). O
There O
are O
now O
several O
studies O
linking O
obesity O
and O
other O
metabolic O
disorders O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
AD. O

the O

the O

When O

Furthermore, O
the O

provided O
proof O
that O
T2DM O

aggravate O
each O

suggested O
several O

In O
fact, O
people O

double O
the O

This O
does O
not O
mean O
that O

that O
all O

It O
is O

to O
report O
that O
there O

an O
important O

it O
is O
therefore O
common O
that O

underpinning O
of O

a O

Aging O

a O
dramatic O
increase O

affecting O
about O
1% O
of O
the O
population O
aged O
between O
65-69 O
years O
up O
to O
30-40% O
in O
the O

(Gatz O

Overall O
occurrence O
in O
the O
population O
above O
65 O
years O
of O
age O
is O
estimated O
to O
6-8% O
and O
is O
expected O
to O
increase O
significantly O
worldwide O
due O
to O
changing O
demographic O
profiles O
with O
an O
ever-increasing O
proportion O
of O
elderly O
(Ferri O
et O
al., O
2005 O
). O
Indeed, O
as O
adulthood O
approaches, O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
stabilizes, O
becomes O
more O
diverse, O
and O
can O
resist O
detrimental O
environmental O
elements O
such O
as O

stress O
by O
restoring O

(Palmer O

In O
the O
present O

however, O
cerebral O
vascular O
disease O
and O
hypertension O
were O
more O
associated O
with O
HCA O

compared O
to O
CA O
infections. O
This O
discrepancy O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
regional O
differences O
in O

diseases. O
Indeed, O
cerebral O
vascular O

and O
hypertension O
are O
epidemics O
in O
Chinese O
communities O
[ O
26 O
, O
27 O
]. O
Patients O
with O
these O

have O
a O
greater O
demand O
for O
medical O

services. O
In O
this O
study, O
the O
30-day O
mortality O
rates O
were O
similar O
for O
patients O
with O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
infections O
and O
both O
patients O
exhibited O
significantly O
higher O
30-day O
mortality O
rates O
than O
CA O

patients. O
These O
results O
were O
similar O
to O
other O
studies O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
] O
and O
may O
largely O
be O
due O
to O
the O
variation O
in O
underlying O
diseases O
between O
the O
three O
groups, O
which O
are O
classical O
risk O
factors O
for O
prognosis O
of O
infectious O
diseases. O
An O
important O
finding O
in O
this O
study O
was O
that O
HCA O
K. O
pneumoniae O
strains O
exhibited O
similar O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
patterns O
with O
nosocomial O
strains, O
and O
both O
the O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
strains O
were O
significantly O
more O
resistant O
than O
the O
CA O
strains. O
This O
observation O
indicates O
that O
clinicians O
should O
consider O
similar O
empirical O
therapy O
for O
patients O
with O
nosocomial O
and O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections. O
A O
recent O
study O
in O
Taiwan O
reported O
that O
the O
rate O
of O
resistance O
in O
the O
group O
of O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
bacteremia O
was O
between O
those O
groups O
of O
nosocomial O
and O
CA O
bacteremia O
[ O
28 O
]. O
This O
discrepancy O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
different O
infection O
types O
of O
the O
population O
studied, O
or O
the O
regional O
differences O
of O
resistance O
characteristics O
in O
K. O
pneumoniae. O
In O
our O
study, O
29.7% O
of O
the O
HCA O
isolates O
were O
carbapenem O
resistant, O
35.9% O
expressed O
ESBL, O
and O
52.3% O
were O
MDR, O
indicating O
the O
severe O
drug O
resistance O
in O
isolates O
from O
the O
HCA O
infections. O
The O
high O
degree O
of O
antibiotic O
resistance O
in O
HCA O
strains O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
frequent O
contact O
with O
healthcare O
facilities O
among O
HCA O
patients, O
where O
the O
drug-resistant O
bacteria O
could O
spread. O
In O
addition, O
other O
factors O
such O
as O
overuse O
of O
antibiotics O
might O
also O
responsible O
for O
developing O
antimicrobial O
resistance. O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
increased O
attention O
should O
be O
paid O
to O
the O
HCA O
K. B-PATH

Management O
The O
management O

is O
symptomatic O
and O

Because O
A-T O

all O

Physical, O

may O
help O

Therapeutic O
exercises O
should O

It O
is O
still O
unknown O
whether O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
mutation O
in O
R. O
anatipestifer O
affects O
the O
viability O
of O

in O

From O
the O
results O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
3 O
, O
it O
could O
be O
concluded O
that O
the O
colonization O
ability O
of O
both O
mutant O
strains O
in O
the O
brain O
and O
trachea O
was O
reduced O
compared O
to O
the O
parental O
strain. O
Compared O
with O
the O
parental O
strain, O
the O
statistical O
difference O
was O
significant O
(P O
&lt; O
0.05). O
The O
number O
of O
colonizing O
bacteria O
in O
the O
parental O
strain O
reached O
a O
peak O
at O
12 O
h O
and O
gradually O
decreased. O
The O
presence O
of O
the O
parental O
strain O
and O
mutant O
strains O
were O
also O
detected O
in O
the O
brain O
and O
trachea, O
but O
the O
number O
of O
colonizing O
bacteria O
in O
the O
parental O
strain O
was O
still O
much O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
the O
mutant O
strain, O
though O
it O
gradually O
decreased O
over O
time. O
In O
addition, O
the O
number O
of O
bacteria O
colonized O
in O
the O
liver, O
lung, O
brain, O
blood, O
and O
spleen O
was O
also O
examined O
after O
24 O
h O
of O
inoculation. O
Since O
the O
number O
of O
viable O
cells O
was O
too O
small O
and O
the O
difference O
was O
not O
significant, O
the O
results O
are O
not O
shown. O
Discussion O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
drug O
resistance O
of O
R. O
anatipestifer O
has O
become O
increasingly O
serious, O
and O
various O
mechanisms O
of O
drug O
resistance O
have O
gradually O
been O
revealed, O
such O
as O
those O
for O
resistance O
to O
chloramphenicol O
[ O
13 O
], O
lincomycin O
[ O
14 O
], O
aminoglycosides O
[ O
15 O
] O
and O
rifampin O
[ O
16 O
]. O
However, O
the O
resistance O
mechanism O
of O
rifampin O
has O
not O
been O
reported. O
Among O
other O
bacteria, O
rifampin O
resistance O
mechanisms O
have O
been O
reported, O
including O
mutations O
in O
the O
rpoB O
gene O
encoding O
the O
drug O
target O
enzyme O
[ O
3 O
, O
17 O
], O
glycosylation, O
modification O
of O
the O
drug O
structure O
by O
ADP O
ribosylation O
or O

modification O
[ O

– O
20 O
], O
and O
the O
efflux O
effect O
of O
the O
drug O
efflux O
pump O
[ O

]. O
Since O
no O
plasmids, O
transposons, O
or O
inactivating O
enzymes O
related O
to O
rifampin O
resistance O
were O
found O
in O
the O
R. O

we O
identified, O
our O
study O
focused O
on O
the O

In O

we O
also O
detected O
VP1 O
and O
pathology O
in O
the O
hindlimb O
skeletal O

(Fig. O

). O
It O
is O
possible O
that O

could O
serve O
as O
an O
intermediate O

of O
EV71 O
during O
the O

In O

One O
striking O

in O

is O
the O
very O

While O
our O
finding O

the O
idea O
that O

it O

not O

with O
the O

great O

Therefore, O
the O
practical O
application O

of O
species O
beneficial O
in O
one O
illness O
will O
not O
necessarily O
hold O
for O

As O
for O
the O
prebiotics, O
inuline O
supplementation O
was O
reported O
to O
be O
able O
to O
increase O
the O
viable O
count O
of O
bifidobacteria O
in O
constipated O
elderly, O
while O
the O
frequency O
of O
the O

of O

decreased O
with O
the O
treatment. O
The O

of O
inuline O
improved O

in O
9 O
out O
of O
10 O
subjects O
(Kleessen O
et O

). O
It O
was O
reported O
that O
fructo-oligosaccharide O

(Guigoz O
et O

2002 O
; O
Bouhnik O
et O

), O
as O
well O
as O
the O
supplementation O
of O
a O
galacto-oligosaccharide O

are O
able O
to O
significantly O
increase O
the O
numbers O
of O
bifidobacteria O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
less O
beneficial O
groups O
(Vulevic O
et O

). O
NSAIDs O
Several O
epidemiological O
studies O
suggested O
that O
NSAIDs O
may O
delay O
the O
onset O
of O
AD O
for O
up O
to O
five O
or O
more O
years, O
and O
are O
even O
able O
to O
prevent O
the O
onset O
of O
AD O
in O
patients O
with O
mild O
cognitive O
impairment O
(MCI) O
or O
in O
healthy O
elderly O
subjects O
at O
risk O
of O
developing O
AD O
(Imbimbo O
et O
al., O
2010 O
). O
Thus, O
it O
could O
be O
hypothesized O
that O
the O
chronic O
use O
of O
NSAIDs O
may O
be O
beneficial O
only O
in O
the O
very O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
AD O
process O
in O
coincidence O
of O
initial O
Aβ O
deposition, O
microglia O
activation O
and O
consequent O
release O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
mediators. O
When O
the O
Aβ O
deposition O
process O
is O
already O
started, O
NSAIDs O
are O
no O
longer O
effective O
and O
may O
even O
be O
detrimental O
because O
of O
their O
inhibitory O
activity O
on O
chronically O
activated O
microglia O
that O
on O
long-term O
may O
mediate O
Aβ O
clearance O
(Imbimbo O
et O
al., O
2010 O
). O
In O
conclusion, O
these O
studies O
indicate O
that O
there O
is O
a O
dose-response O
relationship O
between O
NSAID O
use O
and O
the O
relative O
risk O
of O
AD, O
with O
longer O
periods O
of O
use O
related O
to O
reduce O
relative O
risks O
of O

activation-induced O

the O

This O
highlights O
the O
potential O
of O
Met-Flow O
to O
measure O
reprogramming O

Moreover, O

. O
By O
leveraging O
the O

nature O

Met-Flow, O
we O
dissected O
T-cell O

intracellular O
metabolic O

and O
found O
differential O

At O

our O

higher O
metabolic O

in O
T O

T O

Our O

similarly O
demonstrate O
the O

of O
T O

from O
other O

both O

the O

The O

them O
under O

once O

the O
mushrooms O

Similar O

mushrooms O
are O
recorded O
among O
the O
Rarámuris, O

communities O
in O
Tlaxcala, O
Nevado O

Toluca, O

Zacatlán, O
Puebla O
(Moreno-Fuentes O

as O

as O
in O
other O

Nepal O
(Giri O
and O
Rana O

) O
and O
Cameroon O
(Kinge O

). O
The O
Mestizos O
and O
Wixaritari O
considered O
mushrooms O
to O
be O
rich O
in O
vitamins O
and O
nutrients O
and, O
therefore, O
to O
be O
a O
healthy O
food. O
This O
finding O
coincides O
with O
that O
of O
Bautista-González O
and O
Moreno-Fuentes O
( O
2014 O
), O
who O
mention O
that O
edible O
mushrooms O
are O
considered O
medicinal O
or O
to O
be O
a O
medicinal O
food O
that O
prevents O
illnesses O
because O
of O
their O
high O
nutrient O
content. O
Like O
other O
wild O
foods, O
mushrooms O
were O
considered O
free O
of O
the O
chemical O
agents O
present O
in O
cultivated O
foods. O
This O
perception O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
central O
Mexico O
(Alonso-Aguilar O
et O
al. O
2014 O
; O
Robles-García O
et O

), O
which O
stimulates O
the O
consumption O
of O
wild O
foods O
in O
a O
context O
of O
high O
use O
of O

as O
occurs O
in O

In O

with O
the O
rural O

Mexico, O
where O
the O
sale O
of O
mushrooms O
is O
an O
important O
source O
of O
family O
income O
(Pérez-Moreno O
et O
al. O
2008 O
), O
the O
sale O
of O
mushrooms O
in O
the O
municipality O
was O
an O
insignificant O
source O
of O
extra O
income. O
The O
most O

were, O
in O

V. O

mainly O
by O

These O

literature O
is O
Loop-mediated O
amplification O
(LAMP) O
first O
described O
over O
a O

[ O

The O
LAMP O
reaction O
utilises O
4 O

These O
primers O

are O
extended O
by O

The O

the O

the O

LAMP O
amplification O
has O
been O
used O
for O
many O
pathogen O
detection O
strategies O
due O
to O
rapid O
reaction O
times, O
high O

and O
specificity. O
The O
specificity O
is O
inherent O
from O
the O
use O
of O
multiple O
primers O
but O
this O
can O
also O
mean O
that O
non-specific O
primer O
interaction O
is O
an O
issue. O
The O
false O

that O
these O

primarily O
a O

but O
also O
the O

some O
of O
the O

employed. O
Methods O
for O

both O
real O

The O
literature O

shows O
the O
manifestation O
of O
both O
de O

and O

pathways O
in O
VitB6 O
genes O
for O

Recently, O
Zhang O

52 O
proved O
that O
Botrytis O

show O
the O
involvement O

the O
de O

but O
not O

based O

Also, O
Ralstonia O
solani O
RsolPDX1, O

were O
the O
three O
principal O
factors O
involved O
in O
the O
VitB6 O

in O

53 O
. O
Most O
of O
the O

VitB6 O

addresses O
de O

pathway O
mostly O
but O
salvage O
pathway O
at O
rare O
circumstances, O
interestingly O
lack O
of O
introns O
were O
denoted O
for O
plant-pathogen O

18 O
. O
Hence, O
we O
could O
not O
clearly O
find O
a O
gap O
in O
abridging O
salvage O
pathway O
in O
oxidative O
stress-induced O
plant O

and O

The O
present O
study O
further O
adds O
novel O
results O
for O
the O
environmentally O
useful O
bacteria O
in O
eliciting O
a O
plethora O
of O
optimal O
outcomes. O

As O
PGIP O
belongs O
to O
a O
large O
family O
of O
leucine-rich O
repeat O
(LRR) O
proteins, O
it O
was O
suspected O
that O
a O
hypersensitive O
response O
(HR) O
may O
affect O
SB O
resistance O
in O
A. O
thaliana O
[ O
13 O
]. O
However, O
due O
to O
the O
highly O
complex O
nature O
of O
resistances O
to O
necrotrophic O
pathogens, O
it O
is O
still O
unknown O
if O
these O
mechanisms O
can O
be O
extended O
to O
other O
plant O
species. O
Therefore, O
a O
comprehensive O
molecular O
study O
of O
SB O
resistance O
in O
L. O
ervoides O
would O
not O
only O
benefit O
lentil O
breeding O
but O
also O
broaden O
our O
knowledge O
of O
SB O

in O
systems O
other O
than O

In O
recent O
years, O
the O

In O

several O
RNA-sequencing O

were O
performed O
to O

various O
biotic O

[ O
15 O

]. O
Most O
of O
these O
studies O
were O
conducted O
by O
de O

without O
the O
aid O
of O
a O
reference O

The O
common O
issues O
with O

have O
been O
alignment O
errors, O
problems O
in O
reconstruction O
of O
full-length O

errors O
[ O

As O
the O

was O
recently O
constructed O
by O
Bett O

[ O
21 O
], O
reference-based O

is O
possible O
and O
encouraged O
to O
improve O

As O
RNA O
transcription O
is O
a O
highly O
dynamic O
process, O
the O
appropriate O
sampling O
time O
is O
of O
high O
importance O
to O
capture O

this, O
the O
quantitative O

implemented O
by O
microscopic O

and O
quantitative O
polymerase O

Several O

that O
these O

integrate O
both O

in O

vulgare O
L.) O
offers O
many O
benefits O
for O
organic O
farming O
systems. O
In O
regions O
where O
it O
is O
suitable O
as O
a O
winter O
grain, O
barley O
establishes O
rapidly O
in O
the O
fall O
and O
can O
out-compete O
annual O
winter O
weeds. O
Because O
of O
its O
quick O
canopy O
growth O
after O
seeding, O
barley O
can O
be O
quite O
competitive O
against O
weeds. O
Many O
diseases O
and O
insects O
that O
affect O
barley O
are O
regionally O
specific, O
but O
this O
pressure O
can O
generally O
be O
managed O
effectively O
using O
integrated O
pest O
management O
strategies. O
However, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
most O
currently O
available O
varieties O
have O
been O
selected O
for O
conventional O
growing O
conditions O
and O
many O
may O
not O
always O
be O
the O
best O
suited O
for O
organic O
farming O
conditions; O
breeding O
new O
varieties O
under O
organic O
conditions O
can O
help O
remedy O
this. O
Barley O
offers O
some O
advantages O
over O
other O
small O
grains: O
it O
requires O
less O
nitrogen O
than O
wheat O
and O
matures O
more O
quickly O
than O
other O
small O
grains, O
which O
allows O
subsequent O
crops O
to O
be O
planted O
earlier O
(Wiersma O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Because O
it O
can O
be O
malted O
for O
brewing O
and O
distilling, O
eaten O
as O
a O
food O
grain, O
and O
fed O
to O
livestock, O
barley O
provides O
diverse O
marketing O
options. O
It O
can O
also O
be O
intercropped O
with O
legumes, O
which O
gives O
producers O
the O
option O
to O
till O
it O
in O
as O
a O
green O
manure O
cover O
crop, O
harvest O
before O
maturity O
as O
a O
green O
chop O
fed O
to O
livestock, O
or O
grow O
to O
maturity O
to O
market O
as O
a O
mixed O
feed O
grain, O
depending O
on O
soil O
needs O
and O
market O
conditions. O
Despite O
its O
benefits, O
many O
organic O
farmers O
have O
been O
reluctant O
to O
plant O
barley. O
New O
varieties O
bred O
for O
organic O
systems O
that O
meet O
quality O
standards O
to O
be O
sold O
into O
multiple O
markets O
may O
encourage O
farmers O
to O
add O
barley O
to O
their O
rotation. O
In O
principle, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
breed O
a O
naked O
barley O
suitable O
for O
feed, O
food, O
and O
malting O
that O
will O
perform O
well O
in O
organic O
systems O
(Meints O
and O
Hayes O
2019 O
). O
In O
order O
to O
inform O
the O
breeding O
process O
and O
to O
understand O
what O
qualities, O
traits, O
and O
characteristics O
organic O
farmers O
consider O
important, O
the O
authors O
designed O
and O
implemented O
a O
survey O
and O
conducted O
interviews O
of O
organic O
barley O
producers. O
Materials O
and O

The O

In O

Alternatively, O
the O

may O
explain O
the O
variability O
in O
chlamydial O
disease O
prevalence O
and O
severity O
between O
northern O
and O
southern O

populations. O
The O
physiological O

also O
influence O
susceptibility O

due O
to O

However, O

higher O
prevalence O

chlamydial O

in O
overabundant O
Victorian O

residing O

this O

The O
interactions O
between O
these O
host O
and O
pathogen-associated O
drivers O
of O
chlamydial O

are O
clearly O
complex, O
and O

Much O
of O
our O
current O
understanding O
of O
chlamydial O
epidemiology O
and O
disease O
dynamics O
in O
koalas O
has O
been O
derived O
from O
opportunistic, O
cross-sectional O
field O
studies O
or O
hospital O
data O
sets. O
Historically, O
field O
studies O
are O
likely O
to O
have O
severely O
underestimated O
the O
prevalence O
of O
chlamydial O
disease O
in O
wild O
koala O
populations, O
limited O
by O
a O
lack O
of O
comprehensive O
clinical O
examinations O
that O
included O
ultrasonography O
9 O
, O
11 O
. O
Further, O
field O
studies O
do O
not O
always O
examine O
all O
chlamydial-affected O
anatomical O
sites O
or O
both O
sexes O
9 O
, O
11 O
, O
and O
because O
of O
their O
opportunistic O
or O
cross-sectional O
nature, O
do O
not O
provide O
comprehensive O
data O
sets O
on O
chlamydial O
epidemiology O
and O
disease O
dynamics O
over O
time. O

Since O
assays O
involve O
a O
constant O
temperature O
and O
use O
a O
displacement O
polymerase O
that O
would O
likely O
displace O
the O
molecular O
beacon. O
We O
show O
here O
that O
molecular O
beacons O
indeed O
detect O
LAMP O
amplification O
but O
this O
does O
not O
require O
specific O
annealing O
to O
the O
specific O
target O
sequence. O
However O
the O
increase O
in O
fluorescence O
does O
appear O
to O
be O
linked O
to O
increasing O
concentration O
of O
LAMP O
amplicons O
and O
therefore O
the O
specificity O
is O
greater O
than O
methods O
that O
report O
on O
DNA O
amplification O
only O
since O
a O
positive O
signal O
is O
indicative O
of O
successful O
LAMP O
amplification. O
The O
problem O
of O
posssible O
non-specific O
amplification O
remains O
due O
to O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
LAMP O
molecular O
beacons O
to O
anneal O
specifically O
to O
the O
target O
sequence. O
Nevertheless, O
the O
low O
fluorescence O
output O
from O
the O
LAMP O
molecular O
beacon O
method O
enables O
the O
quantification O
of O
a O
wider O
dynamic O
range O
of O
target O
concentrations O
to O
be O
assayed O
in O
comparison O
to O
detection O
with O
an O
intercalating O
fluorescent O
dye. O
The O
detection O
and O
quantification O
of O
genetically O
modified O
materials O
in O
food O
is O
essential O
to O
comply O
with O
legislation O
and O
two O
of O
the O
most O
common O
markers O
of O

are O
the O

and O
nopaline O

terminator O
from O
Agrobacterium O
tumefaciens, O
used O
to O
express O
the O
transgenes. O
Here O
we O
target O
these O
transgenic O
elements O
in O
maize O
event O
Bt11 O
in O
a O
mass O
fraction O
with O
wild O
type O
maize. O
We O
have O
designed O
molecular O
beacons O
for O
the O
35S O
promoter O
and O
NOS O
terminator O
sequences O
to O
complement O
LAMP O
primers O
previously O
established O
for O
amplification O
[ O
16 O
– O
18 O
]. O
Our O
work O
initially O
focused O
on O
probing O
the O
forward O
loop O
structure O
of O
LAMP O
amplicons, O
but O
this O
precluded O
the O
use O
of O
accelerating O
loop O
primers O
[ O
4 O
]. O
We O
therefore O
concentrated O
on O
the O
stem O
region O
between O
loops O
to O
enable O
the O
forward O
loop O
primer O
to O
be O
included O
for O
faster O
amplification. O
This O
work O
revealed O
that O
whilst O
molecular O
beacons O
detect O
LAMP O
amplification O
products, O
they O
do O
so O
irrespective O
of O
amplified O
sequence. O
They O
can O
therefore O
be O
used O
to O
detect O
LAMP O
amplicon, O
but O
not O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
amplified O
sequence. O

but O
the O

Introduction O
Australia’s O
northern O
koala O
populations O
are O
being O
pushed O
towards O
extinction O
by O
ongoing O
habitat O
degradation O
due O
to O
urban O
and O
agricultural O
development O
1 O
, O
and O
as O
they O
decline, O
the O
threat O
of O
chlamydial O
disease O
is O
likely O
to O
become O
more O
significant. O
Chlamydial O
disease O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
negatively O
impact O
the O
viability O
of O
declining O
koala O
populations O
due O
to O
effects O
on O
mortality O
and O
reproductive O
rates, O
with O
up O
to O
57% O
of O
female O
koalas O
infertile O
in O
some O
populations O
2 O
and O
disease O
identified O
as O
the O
largest O
single O
contributor O
to O
mortality O
in O
others O
3 O
. O
Chlamydial O
disease O
control O
has O
subsequently O
been O
identified O
as O
a O
potential O
population O
management O
tool O
3 O
, O
and O
successful O
conservation O
outcomes O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
with O
this O
approach. O
For O
example, O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
prevalence O
of O
chlamydial O
disease O
in O
a O
declining O
south-east O
Queensland O
(SE O
Qld) O
koala O
population, O
from O
20% O
to O
4%, O
contributed O
to O
positive O
population O
growth O
rates O
after O
management O
interventions O
4 O
. O
Two O
species O
of O
Chlamydia O
infect O
koalas, O
C. O
pneumoniae O
and O
C. O
pecorum, O
but O
disease O
is O
predominantly O
associated O
with O
C. O
pecorum O
5 O
. O
Chlamydial O
infections O
in O
koalas, O
as O
with O
other O
hosts, O
are O
often O
characterised O
by O
asymptomatic O
carriage O
6 O
. O
However, O
in O
susceptible O
individuals, O
they O
can O
cause O
inflammatory O
and O
fibrotic O
disease O
in O
the O
urinary O
and O
reproductive O
tracts, O
at O
the O
ocular O
site O
5 O
, O
and O
occasionally O
in O
the O
respiratory O
tract O
7 O
. O
Attempts O
have O
been O
made O
to O
identify O
the O
factors O
that O
drive O
chlamydial O
disease O
progression O
in O
these O
individuals O
8 O
, O
however, O
despite O
its O
importance, O
a O
comprehensive O
understanding O
of O
chlamydial O
epidemiology O
and O
disease O
dynamics O
in O
koalas O
is O
lacking. O
Previously O
suggested O
drivers O
of O
chlamydial O
disease O
progression O
in O
koalas O
include O
several O
pathogen-associated O
factors, O
such O
as O
the O
chlamydial O
strain O
and O
infection O
load. O
Chlamydial O
disease O
prevalence O
and O
severity O
varies O
between O
koala O
populations, O
with O
a O
higher O
prevalence O
and O
severity O
reported O
in O
the O
northern O
part O
of O
Australia O
5 O
, O
9 O
, O
10 O
. O
One O
hypothesis O
to O
explain O
this O
pattern O
of O
disease O
occurrence O
is O
the O
geographical O
distribution O
of O
genetically O
distinct O
chlamydial O
strains, O
as O
characterised O
by O
chlamydial O
outer O
membrane O
protein O
A O
(ompA) O
genotyping. O

The O
refractory O
state O
to O
virus O
infection O
reached O
a O
maximum O
after O
2 O
h O
of O
pre-treatment O
and O
is O
fully O
maintained O
up O
to O
12 O
h O
later, O
however O
even O
at O
24 O
h O
the O
cells O
still O
remain O
partially O
resistant O
to O
virus O
infection. O
Since O
acidification O
of O
vacuolar O
compartments O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
cellular O
processes O
we O
wondered O
where O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM O
could O
inhibit O
the O
antiviral O
state O
induced O
by O
interferon O
treatment. O
The O
results O
presented O
in O
Figure O
2a O
showed O
that O
a O
concentration O
of O
50 O
μg/ml O
of O
CDM O
alone O
or O
in O
combination O
with O
interferon O
did O
not O
affect O
uninfected O
cell O
viability. O
Moreover, O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM, O
either O
alone O
or O
in O
combination, O
for O
48 O
h O
(Figures O
2b O
and O
2c O
) O
contributes O
to O
protect O
cells O
from O
virus O
CPE. O
So, O
the O
results O
obtained O
were O
not O
perturbed O
by O
compounds O
cytopathicity. O
To O
test O
the O
antiviral O
action O
of O
IFN O
we O
used O
a O
standard O
procedure O
comprising O
a O
period O
of O
16 O
h O
cell O
treatment O
(induction O
of O
the O
antiviral O
state) O
previous O
to O
virus O
infection. O
IFN O
was O
then O
removed O
during O
virus O
adsorption O
and O
after O
that O
re-added O
up O
to O
virus O
harvest. O
The O
presence O
of O
CDM O
for O
2 O
h O
before O
induction, O
during O
the O
16 O
h O
induction O
period, O
only O
for O
24 O
h O
after O
infection O
or O
during O
the O
complete O
IFN O
treatment O
period O
did O
not O
affect O
IFN O
action. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM, O
an O
enhanced O
effect O
of O
the O
antiviral O
action O
of O
each O
interferon O
alone O
or O
in O
combination O
(see O

was O
observed O
indicating O
that O

CDM O
[ O

did O
not O
interfere O
with O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
refractory O
stage O
to O
HSV-2 O
infection O
in O
cells O
treated O
with O
IFN. O
It O
is O
remarkable O
that O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
HSV-2 O
to O
CDM O
increased O
steadily O
in O
accordance O
with O
time O
of O
cell O
treatment. O
Thus, O
after O
2 O
h O
pretreatment O
with O
CDM O
virus O
titer O
was O
2 O
fold O
reduced O
(Figure O
3a O
) O
but O
if O
pretreatment O
was O
extended O
to O
16 O
h, O
virus O
reduction O
increased O
10 O
times O
(Figure O

While O
intronless O
genes O
are O
frequently O
found O
in O
single-celled O
eukaryotes O
they O
are O
much O
less O
common O
in O
multicellular O
plants O
animals O
and O
fungi. O
Hence, O
in O
the O
Metazoa, O
between O
3 O
and O
17% O
of O
genes O
are O
intronless O
in O
deuterostomes O
(including O
3% O
in O
humans O
and O
8% O
in O
mice). O
In O
contrast, O
about O
20% O
of O
genes O
are O
intronless O
in O
well-studied O
plant O
species O
such O
as O
rice O
and O
Arabidopsis O
[ O
80 O
]. O
In O
the O
fungi, O
intronless O
genes O
are O
rare O
and O
there O
is O
evidence O
that O
the O
ancestral O
fungal O
(and O
animal) O
genomes O
were O
especially O
intron-rich O
with O
average O
intron O
densities O
in O
genes O
from O
major O
fungal O
groups O
such O
as O
Ascomycetes O
and O
Basidiomycetes O
reported O
to O
be O
among O
the O
highest O
among O
all O
of O
the O
eukaryote O
groups O
[ O
81 O
]. O
Extant O
fungal O
genomes O
are O
very O
small O
in O
comparison O
with O
those O
of O
most O
extant O
plant O
and O
animal O
genomes, O
with O
typical O
sizes O
averaging O
below O
45 O
Mb O
[ O
76 O
]. O
This O
may O
have O
been O
due O
to O
a O
considerable O
reduction O
in O
genome O
size O
in O
fungi O
following O
their O
divergence O
from O
other O
Opisthokonts. O
At O
the O
level O
of O
individual O
genes, O
the O
subsequent O
evolution O
of O
the O
fungi O
has O
been O
characterised O
by O
a O
mixed O
picture O
with O
the O
maintenance O
of O
intron-rich O
genomes O
in O
some O
lineages O
but O
a O
sharp O
reduction O
in O
intron O
density O
in O
others. O
Indeed, O
some O
Ascomycete O
genomes O
are O
reportedly O
almost O
completely O
intronless, O
which O
is O
very O
unusual O
for O
such O
advanced O
eukaryotic O
species O
and O
may O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
overall O
reduction O
in O

will O
be O
carried O

to O
further O
examine O
this O
comprehensive O
epidemiological-virological O
picture. O
The O
present O
study O
has O
a O
number O
of O
possible O
limitations. O
One O
limiting O
factor O
was O
the O
age O
limit O
criterion O
(18 O
years) O
applied O
for O
eligible O
participants, O
since O
many O
PWUIDs O
report O
an O
onset O
of O
illicit O
drug O
use O
at O
ages O
&lt; O
18 O
years. O
Second, O
the O
restriction O
of O
the O
study O
to O
the O
municipalities O
of O
the O
Amazon O
region O
renders O
the O
study O
sample O
not O
necessarily O
representative O
of O
the O
PWUIDs O
population O
in O
Northern O
Brazil O
more O
generally. O
In O
addition, O
although O
snowball O
sampling O
has O
been O
found O
to O
be O
adequate O
for O
quasi-representative O
sampling O
in O
hidden O
populations, O
could O
have O
been O
used O
to O
improve O
representativeness. O
As O
the O
interview O
data O
are O
self-reported, O
some O
information, O
such O
as O
drug O
use O
or O
sex-related O
risks O
behaviors, O
may O
contain O
response O
or O
recall O
bias. O
Screening O
for O
HCV O
infection O
was O
based O
on O
EIA, O
recent O
infections O
may O
present O
a O
small O
concentration O
of O
anti-HCV O
antibodies, O
not O
yet O
detected O
by O
EIA, O
and O
therefore O
may O
have O
been O
diagnosed O
as O
negative. O
Finally, O
the O
cross-sectional O
design O
of O
the O
study O
limits O
its O
capacity O
to O
establish O
causality. O
Conclusions O
The O
present O
study O
is O
the O
first O
epidemiological O
examination O
of O
HCV O
infection O
(active O
or O
non-active) O
status O
and O
related O
risk O
factors O
among O
a O
large, O
multi-site O
sample O
of O
PWUIDs O
in O
the O
Amazon O
region. O
High O

and O
social O

– O
as O

as O

were O
identified. O
The O
results, O
despite O
the O
context O
of O
an O
underdeveloped O
health O

structure, O
emphasize O
the O
urgent O
need O
for O
improved O
HCV O
prevention O
and O
care O
services O
for O
marginalized O
drug O
users O
in O
the O
Brazilian O
Amazon O
region, O
yet O
also O
for O
improved O
understanding O
of O
HCV O
transmission O
risks O
and O
especially O
those O
factors O
facilitating O
spontaneous O
clearance O
for O
HCV O
in O
the O
study’s O
target O
population. O

Indeed, O
all O
the O
genes O
required O
for O
sorbose O
utilization, O
i.e., O
those O
encoding O
l O
-sorbose-phosphate-reductase O
and O
its O
transcriptional O
regulator, O
sorbitol-6-phosphate O
dehydrogenase, O
four O
components O
of O
a O
sorbose-specific O
PTS, O
and O
fructose-bisphosphate O
aldolase O
(Yebra O
et O
al. O
2000 O
) O
are O
present O
in O
the O
IBB3423 O
genome. O
Eleven O
genes O
for O
d O
-adonitol O
metabolism O
(LCAKO_2999 O
to O
LCAKO_3009) O
encode O
components O
of O
a O
mannose-type O
PTS, O
a O
transcriptional O
regulator, O
and O
six O
other O
enzymes O
(Bourand O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Also, O
the O
fos O
operon O
involved O
in O
utilization O
of O
fructo-oligosaccharides O
(FOS), O
such O
as O
inulin, O
and O
the O
transport O
of O
free O
fructose O
(Goh O
et O
al. O
2006 O
) O
was O
identified O
in O
the O
IBB3423 O
genome. O
As O
inulin, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
studied O
prebiotics, O
is O
known O
to O
aid O
the O
development O
of O
desirable O
gastrointestinal O
microflora O
(Kolida O
et O
al. O
2002 O
), O
the O
ability O
to O
metabolize O
it O
is O
a O
very O
important O
property O
of O
probiotic O
bacteria. O
Among O
the O
bacteria O
that O
do O
metabolize O
prebiotic O
oligosaccharides O
are O
some O
strains O
of O
Lactobacillus O
and O
Bifidobacterium O
spp., O
and O
numerous O
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
their O
growth O
is O
stimulated O
by O
FOS O
or O
other O
oligosaccharides. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
comparing O
with O
the O
control O
strains O
used O
by O
us, O
isolated O
from O
the O
human O
gastrointestinal O
tract, O
IBB3423 O
does O
not O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
ferment O
l O
-rhamnose, O
dulcitol, O
inositol, O
and O
l O
-fucose, O
probably O
due O
to O
their O
low O
abundance O
in O
cow O
milk. O

Members O
of O
this O
genus O
represent O
an O
extremely O
diverse O
group O
of O
species O
with O
various O
physiological, O
biochemical, O
and O
genetic O
characteristics O
and O
are O
able O
to O
colonize O
diverse O
ecological O
niches, O
including O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
(GIT) O
of O
humans O
and O
animals, O
plants, O
and O
dairy O
food O
environments O
(Makarova O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
Kandler O
1983 O
). O
Lactobacilli O
are O
rod-shaped, O
Gram-positive, O
non-spore-forming, O
lactic O
acid-producing, O
generally O
nonmotile O
bacteria O
that O
can O
survive O
mainly O
in O
anaerobic O
environments O
(Claesson O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Kandler O
1983 O
). O
Due O
to O
their O
advantageous O
properties O
and O
a O
long O
history O
of O
safe O
use, O
lactobacilli O
are O
used O
as O
starter O
cultures O
in O
both O
traditional O
fermentation O
and O
various O
industrial O
bioprocesses O
(Stiles O
and O
Holzapfel O
1997 O
). O
Furthermore, O
having O
the O
generally O
recognized O
as O
safe O
(GRAS) O
status, O
many O
species O
are O
considered O
probiotics, O
i.e., O
live O
microorganisms O
intended O
to O
confer O
health O
benefits O
after O
consumption O
(Makarova O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
Fuller O
1991 O
; O
Ouwehand O
et O
al. O
2002 O
; O
Lebeer O
et O
al. O
2008 O
). O
The O
probiotic O
properties O
of O
microorganisms O
are O
determined O
by O
factors O
that O
include O
their O
adaptation O
to O
the O
GIT O
and O
those O
directly O
mediating O
the O
health O
effects O
to O
the O
host. O
The O
adaptation O
factors O
include O
the O
ability O
to O
survive O
in O
the O
harsh O
conditions O
of O
the O
GIT O
(low O
pH O
and O
high O
concentration O
of O
bile O
salts) O
and O
adherence O
to O
mucosal O
surfaces O
(mucus, O
extracellular O
matrix O
proteins O
(ECM), O
or O
epithelial O
cells) O
(Holzapfel O
et O
al. O
2001 O
; O
Marco O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
Lebeer O
et O
al. O
2008 O
). O
One O
of O
the O
most O
desirable O
traits O
for O
probiotic O
bacteria O
is O
good O
adherence O
capacity, O
as O
it O
is O
responsible O
for O
successful O
colonization O
of O
the O
mucosal O
surfaces O
(Ouwehand O

). O

CYP51B1: O
the O
first O
prokaryotic O
sterol O
demethylase O
Cyp51b1 O
was O
the O
first O
prokaryotic O
sterol O
demethylase O
gene O
identified O
in O
a O
bacterial O
genome. O
Spectroscopic O
analysis O
of O
the O
recombinant O
CYP51B1 O
showed O
that O
the O
P450 O
form O
rapidly O
converted O
to O
the O
P420 O
species. O
The O
stability O
of O
the O
P450 O
form O
was O
increased O
when O
it O
was O
bound O
to O
its O
cognate O
substrate O
analog O
estriol O
(McLean O
et O
al. O
2006b O
; O
Dunford O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
CYP51B1 O
was O
the O
first O
Mtb O
CYP O
enzyme O
for O
which O
crystal O
structures O
were O
unraveled O
in O
the O
ligand-free O
and O
ligand-bound O
states. O
The O
enzyme O
was O
co-crystalized O
with O
azole O
compounds. O
Azoles O
were O
shown O
to O
bind O
with O
high O
affinity O
to O
CYP51B1, O
with O
a O
K O
D O
equal O
to O
0.18, O
0.2, O
0.3, O
and O
2.1 O
μM O
for O
clotrimazole, O
miconazole, O
econazole, O
and O
voriconazole, O
respectively O
(Aoyama O
et O
al. O
1998 O
; O
Podust O
et O
al. O
2001 O
, O
2004 O
). O
Mtb O
CYP51B1 O
displayed O
sterol O
demethylase O
activity O
with O
lanosterol O
and O
dihydrolanosterol O
as O
substrates. O
In O
addition, O
the O
plant O
sterol O
obtusifoliol O
was O
converted O
to O
the O
respective O
8,14-diene O
products O
when O
reconstituted O
with O
cognate O
and O
surrogate O
bacterial O
redox O
partners O
(Fig. O
1 O
) O
(Bellamine O
et O
al. O
1999 O
; O
Zanno O
et O
al. O
2005 O
). O
However, O
the O
relevance O
of O
this O
activity O
to O
mycobacterial O
physiology O
remains O
unclear, O
since O
the O
complete O
sterol O
biosynthetic O
pathway O
is O
lacking O
in O
Mtb O
(McLean O
and O
Munro O
2008 O
). O
The O
unknown O
physiological O
role O
combined O
with O
the O
non-essentiality O
may O
limit O
the O
suitability O
of O
CYP51B1 O
as O
a O
drug O
target O
in O
Mtb. O

Such O
fish O
can O
then O
be O
selected O
and O
used O
for O
producing O
the O
F2 O
generation O
which O
will O
be O
100% O
homozygous O
for O
the O
given O
trait. O
Lastly, O
hormonal O
induction O
of O
dnd-KD O
sterilized O
individuals O
into O
females O
needs O
to O
be O
confirmed O
and O
tested. O
Preliminary O
results O
obtained O
by O
Saito O
et O
al. O
(cited O
from O
Goto O
and O
Saito O
34 O
) O
display O
that O
eggs O
can O
be O
obtained O
from O
sterilized O
zebrafish O
recipients O
after O
hormonal O
treatment. O
In O
such O
case, O
the O
production O
of O
100% O
donor-derived O
eggs, O
and O
subsequently O
100% O
donor-derived O
and O
homozygous O
offspring O
would O
be O
possible. O
The O
strategy O
for O
the O
preservation O
of O
genetic O
resources O
developed O
in O
this O
study O
is O
complementary O
to O
the O
sperm O
cryopreservation O
techniques O
currently O
utilized O
in O
leading O
zebrafish O
line O
repositories O
as O
well O
as O
other O
zebrafish O
facilities O
10 O
. O
A O
key O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
is O
that O
freezing O
of O
testes O
requires O
sacrificing O
donor O
individuals, O
while O
sperm O
cryopreservation O
enables O
a O
long-term O
utilization O
of O
one O
individual O
male. O
Therefore O
while O
some O
individuals O
can O
be O
kept O
for O
milt O
production, O
several O
males O
(or O
in O
need O
even O
the O
whole O
line) O
can O
be O
sacrificed O
so O
that O
the O
genetic O
resource O
can O
be O
recovered O
at O
a O
later O
date. O
If O
we O
take O
into O
account O
that O
approximately O
50% O
of O
the O
SSCs O
survive O
the O
cryopreservation O
procedure, O
and O
that O
donor O
SSCs O
incorporate O
into O
30–50% O
of O
the O
recipient O
individuals, O
approximately O
10–15 O
recipients O
producing O
donor-derived O
gametes O
can O
be O
obtained O
from O
sacrificing O
one O
male. O
Additionally, O
even O
though O
the O
application O
of O
sperm O
cryopreservation O
has O
been O
proven O
in O
practice O
35 O
, O
the O
application O
of O
this O
method O
only O
preserves O
the O
male O
germline, O
therefore, O
the O
line O
needs O
to O
be O
recovered O
usually O
from O
the O
AB O
wild-type O
eggs. O
In O
this O
case, O
the O
F1 O
generation O
is O
100% O
heterozygous, O
while O
in O
the O
F2 O
generation O
only O
25% O
of O
the O
fish O
are O
homozygous, O
thus O
making O
recovery O
of O
the O
homozygous O
lines O
laborious O
and O
expensive. O
Conversely, O
the O
surrogate O
preservation O
technique O
allows O
for O
the O
full O
homozygous O
line O
to O
be O
recovered O
in O
the O
F1 O
generation O
spawned O
from O
the O
recipients. O

Also O
the O
plasmidic O
spaCBA O
from O
L. O
paracasei O
LOCK O
0919 O
seems O
to O
be O
functional O
and O
responsible O
for O
the O
strong O
adhesiveness O
of O
this O
strain O
(Aleksandrzak-Piekarczyk O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
It O
is O
postulated O
that O
insertion O
of O
an O
IS O
element O
in O
the O
spaC O
promoter O
region O
in O
both O
L. O
rhamnosus O
GG O
and O
L. O
paracasei O
LOCK O
0919 O
allows O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
pili O
genes O
(Douillard O
et O
al. O
2013 O
; O
Aleksandrzak-Piekarczyk O
et O
al. O
2016 O
). O
Notably, O
the O
upstream O
region O
of O
the O
IBB3423 O
spaCBA O
operon O
harbored O
by O
pLCAKO.2 O
also O
contains O
an O
insertion O
element O
indicating O
that O
it O
likely O
is O
functional. O
Indeed, O
the O
removal O
of O
pLCAKO.2 O
led O
to O
a O
marked O
decrease O
of O
IBB3423 O
hydrophobicity O
and O
adhesiveness O
to O
biotic O
and O
abiotic O
surfaces. O
The O
presence O
of O
such O
a O
plasmid O
should O
therefore O
facilitate O
colonization O
and O
ensure O
longer O
persistence O
in O
the O
host’s O
gut O
thereby O
conferring O
a O
competitive O
advantage O
over O
other O
bacteria. O
It O
can O
also O
increase O
the O
range O
of O
inhabited O
environments. O
Plasmidic O
localization O
of O
the O
spaCBA O
operon, O
such O
as O
in O
IBB3423, O
is O
extremely O
rare O
albeit O
not O
unique O
since O
among O
all O
the O

only O
two, O

and O

harbor O
the O

In O
conclusion, O
the O
newly O
identified O
dairy O
strain O
L. O
paracasei O
subsp. O
paracasei O
IBB3423 O
presents O
genomic O
and O
functional O
features O
making O
it O
a O
very O
promising O
candidate O
probiotic. O

Therefore, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
define O
it O
as O
a O
multidrug-resistant O
(MDR) O
strain. O
Aminoacidic O
substitutions O
(V405A O
and/or O
Q557E) O
in O
penicillin-binding O
protein O
2X O
(PBP2X) O
and O
other O
mutations O
on O
PBP2B O
and O
PBP1A O
domains, O
which O
confer O
β-lactam O
resistance, O
could O
be O
the O
basis O
of O
this O
reduced O
susceptibility O
[ O
23 O
– O
28 O
]. O
However, O
since O
penicillin-resistant O
GBS O
strains O
were O
found O
in O
the O
different O
regions O
of O
the O
world, O
including O
the O
USA O
[ O
24 O
], O
Africa O
[ O
34 O
], O
Colombia O
[ O
60 O

Japan O
[ O

], O
Central O
Italy O
[ O
35 O
], O
Scotland O
[ O
62 O
], O
and O
Canada O
[ O
63 O
], O
the O
question O
if O
these O
resistance O
phenotypes O
are O
due O
to O
sporadic O
mutations, O
independently O
acquired O
by O
some O
GBS O
strains, O
rather O
than O
to O
diffusion O
of O
β-lactam-resistant O
GBS O
clones, O
or O
even O
to O
both O
events, O
remains O
open. O
Concerning O
the O
fluoroquinolone O
classes, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
efficacy O
of O
the O
antibiotic O
levofloxacin. O
Although O
the O
number O
of O
resistant O
strains O
constantly O
increased O
over O
the O
5 O
years, O
going O
from O
only O
8 O
(1.4%) O
cases O
in O
2015 O
to O
60 O
(7.1%) O
in O
2019, O
this O
increment O
did O
not O
produce O
statistically O
significant O
fluctuation. O
Studies O
conducted O
in O
Northern O
(from O
January O
2013 O
to O
June O
2014) O
and O
Central O
(from O
2010 O
to O
2016) O
Italy O
revealed O
a O
levofloxacin O
resistance O
rate O
of O
1.4% O
and O
2.99%, O
respectively. O
Accordingly, O
the O
incidence O
of O
levofloxacin O
resistance O
of O
GBS O
is O
fairly O
constant O
in O
Italy. O
Furthermore, O
molecular O
investigations O
highlighted O
mutations O
in O
DNA O
gyrase O
and O
topoisomerase O
IV O
involved O
in O
fluoroquinolone O
resistance O
and O
consequently O
defined O
quinolone O
resistance-determining O
regions O
[ O
58 O
, O
59 O
]. O
Interestingly, O
all O
tested O
GBS O
strains O
were O
susceptible O
to O
cefditoren O
and O
vancomycin. O

It O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
determine O
how O
this O
method O
fares O
for O
use O
in O
DNA-based O
ultrasensitive O
PCR O
techniques O
as O
well O
[ O
13 O
]. O
In O
addition O
to O
improved O
sensitivity, O
the O
described O
method O
is O
also O
high-throughput O
and O
cost-effective. O
The O
new O
method O
is O
4.5 O
and O
8.7 O
times O
less O
expensive O
than O
Qiagen O
QIAamp O
and O
Investigator O
kits, O
respectively O
(the O
latter O
of O
which O
is O
not O
high-throughput) O
(Table O

). O
Further, O
the O
collection O
and O
shipment O
of O
DBS O
is O
also O
markedly O
less O
expensive O
and O
cumbersome O
than O
whole O
blood-based O
methods. O
These O
qualities O
make O
the O
DBS O
method O
presented O
here O
ideal O
for O
use O
in O
large-scale O
surveillance O
by O
public O
health O
laboratories. O

Based O
on O

extractions O
It O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
as O
sensitivity O
increases, O
specificity O
often O
decreases. O
Previous O
reports O
have O
highlighted O
the O
use O
of O
strict O
contamination O
control O
measures O
to O
prevent O
cross-contamination O
of O
samples, O
particularly O
during O
cutting O
of O
the O
DBS O
samples O
[ O
17 O
]. O
Given O
the O
increased O
sensitivity O
of O
the O
current O
assay, O
it O
is O
recommended O
that O
such O
precautions O
be O
utilized. O
Finally, O
the O
method O
described O
here O
may O
enable O
other O
applications O
from O
DBS. O
For O
example, O
it O
may O
prove O
useful O
for O
detection O
of O
other O
resistance O
markers, O
such O
as O
plasmepsin2/3 O
for O
piperaquine O
resistance. O
Recent O
reports O
show O
that O
whole-genome O
sequencing O
is O
now O
possible O
from O
DBS, O
albeit O
only O
for O
high-density O
infections O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Therefore, O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
determine O
whether O
use O
of O
this O
optimized O
protocol O
will O
allow O
for O
sequencing O
from O
lower O
density O
infections O
as O
well. O

In O
the O
present O
study, O
weanling O
mice O
were O
exposed O
to O
RSV O
and/or O
ovalbumin O
(Ova) O
to O
examine O
the O
effect O
of O
early O
exposures O
on O
pulmonary O
pathophysiology. O
We O
report O
that O
weanling O
mice O
infected O
with O
RSV O
then O
exposed, O
Ova O
fail O
to O
develop O
airway O
hyperreactivity O
(AHR) O
or O
long-term O
pathophysiologic O
changes, O
while O
weanling O
mice O
exposed O
first O
to O
Ova O
then O
infected O
with O
RSV O
developed O
increased O
AHR O
and O
long-term O
pulmonary O
pathologies. O
This O
increase O
in O
AHR O
was O
accompanied O
by O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
due O
to O
increased O
eosinophil O
and O
lymphocyte O
cell O
numbers, O
mucus O
cell O
hypertrophy, O
and O
enhanced O
mucus O
production. O
Intriguingly, O
the O
mice O
also O
exhibited O
signs O
of O
airway O
remodeling O
including O
subepithelial O
fibrosis. O
The O
observed O
remodeling O
events O
were O
correlated O
with O
increased O
levels O
of O
various O
cytokines O
including O
TNF-α, O
IFN-γ, O
IL-5, O
and O
IL-2. O
Collectively, O
these O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
RSV O
infections, O
when O
combined O
with O
an O
allergic O
predisposition, O
can O
have O
long-term O
consequences O
for O
the O
lung O
and O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
development O
of O
inflammatory O
disease O

Phenotypically, O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
are O
defined O
as O
Gram-negative, O
facultatively O
anaerobic, O
non-spore O
forming O
rods. O
They O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
distinctive O
from O
other O
members O
of O
the O
family O
Enterobacteriacae O
in O
the O
same O
traits, O
including O
their O
inability O
to O
reduce O
nitrate O
to O
nitrite, O
which O
is O
the O
major O
positive O
feature O
of O
this O
family O
(Boemare O
2002 O
; O
Imhoff O
2005 O
). O
Another O
unique O
feature O
of O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
is O
their O
phenotypic O
variation, O
i.e. O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
primary O
and O
secondary O
form; O
however, O
the O
environmental O
stimuli O
and O
the O
role O
of O
the O
switch O
between O
two O
cell O
types O
in O
the O
life O
cycle O
of O
EPN O
symbionts O
are O
unclear O
(Boemare O
and O
Akhurst O
1988 O
). O
Recently, O
new O
information O
about O
differences O
in O
the O
transcriptome O
level O
between O
the O
two O
cell O
forms O
has O
contributed O
to O
formulation O
of O
a O
hypothesis O
that O
primary O
cells, O
which O
are O
not O
able O
to O
reassociate O
with O
nematodes, O
can O
live O
freely O
in O
the O
rhizosphere O
(Eckstein O
et O
al. O
2019 O
). O
Only O
bacteria O
of O
the O
genus O
Photorhabdus O
are O
positive O
for O
catalase O
and O
bioluminescence, O
thus O
they O
can O
be O
easily O
differentiated O
from O
bacteria O
of O
the O
genus O
Xenorhabdus O
by O
these O
two O
traits. O
The O
bioluminescence O
ability O
is O
the O
most O
curious O
phenotypic O
characteristic O
of O
the O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria. O
In O
fact, O
Photorhabdus O
are O
the O
only O
known O
bioluminescent O
terrestrial O
bacteria O
that O
are O
able O
to O
produce O
light; O
however, O
the O
function O
of O
this O
trait O
in O
Photorhabdus O
is O
unclear. O
Peat O
et O
al. O
( O
2010 O
) O
showed O
a O
decline O
in O
bioluminescence O
intensity O
throughout O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria, O
supporting O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
this O
feature O
was O
acquired O
by O
their O
ancestor O
living O
in O
an O
aquatic O
environment O
but O
now O
is O
gradually O
being O
lost O
under O
terrestrial O
selection O
pressure. O
This O
agrees O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
bioluminescence O
in O
Photorhabdus O
as O
a O
non-functional O
evolutionary O
remnant O
that O
has O
not O
had O
enough O
time O
to O
be O
lost, O
as O
proposed O
earlier O
by O
Peat O
and O
Adams O
( O
2008 O
). O

Longer O
histories O
(&gt; O
12 O
years) O
of O
illicit O
drug O
use O
was O
the O
characteristic O
most O
strongly O
associated O
with O
HCV O
infection O
status, O
implying O
extended O
opportunity O
for O
and O
exposure O
to O
repeated O
key O
risk O
behaviors O
facilitating O
the O
acquisition O
of O
HCV O
and O
other O
pathogens, O
such O
as: O
sharing O
of O

equipment, O
and O
injection O
drug O
use O
[ O
16 O
, O
17 O
, O

]. O
The O
active O
involvement O
with O
drug O
trafficking O
as O
a O
risk O
factor O
likely O
provides O
quick O
and O
easy O
access O
to O
a O
greater O
number O

(e.g., O

increased O
risk O
pathways O
to O
HCV O
transmission. O
Moreover, O
those O
newly O
infected O
with O
HCV O
can O
continue O
to O
transmit O
HCV O
to O
other O
users O
through O
the O
shared O
use O
of O
non-injection O
equipment O
(i.e., O
crack O
smoking O
paraphernalia). O
The O
possibility O
of O
HCV O
transmission O
by O
shared O
non-injection O
equipment O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
by O
studies O
in O
several O
countries, O
including O
studies O
in O
the O
Amazon O
region O
[ O
24 O
, O
43 O
– O
46 O
]. O
Recently, O
the O
presence O
of O
HCV-RNA O
in O
paraphernalia O
for O
crack-cocaine O
consumption O
(pipes O
and O
aluminum O
cans) O
was O
detected O
among O
samples O
from O
the O
Amazon O
region O
[ O
46 O
]. O
Studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
HCV O
transmission O
by O
shared O
non-injection O
paraphernalia O
would O
be O
modulated O
by O
the O
presence O
oral O
wounds O
and O
types O
of O
paraphernalia O
(i.e., O
sharp O
or O
heat-intensive O
materials) O
used O
[ O
44 O
– O
46 O
]. O
Sexual O
transmission O
of O
HCV O
is O
still O
controversially O
discussed, O
but O
considered O
possible O
[ O
47 O
]. O
Sexual O
transmission O
of O
HCV O
has O
been O
more O
commonly O
recorded O
in O
men-who-have-sex-with-men O
featuring O
high O
sexual O
(e.g., O
HIV) O
and O
drug O
use O
risks O
status O
[ O
48 O
]. O
Other O
studies O
have O
indicated O
the O
possibility O
of O
sexual O
transmission O
of O
HCV O
among O
PWUIDs O
with O
sexually O
transmitted O
infections O
(STIs), O
especially O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
oral O
and/or O
genital O
wounds O
[ O
49 O
, O

]. O

However, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
assume O
that O
any O
article O
published O
in O
EP O
and O
E&amp;HB O
is O
allied O
to O
the O
discipline O
of O
evolutionary O
psychology, O
broadly O
conceived. O
In O
addition, O
the O
choice O
follows O
Kurzban’s O
( O
2013 O
) O
selection O
of O
E&amp;HB O
for O
analysis O
and O
the O
publication O
of O
his O
analysis O
within O
the O
Evolutionary O
Psychology O
blog, O
on O
the O
website O
of O
the O
eponymous O
journal. O
The O
coders O
recorded O
the O
geographical O
region O
from O
which O
the O
data O
originated O
based O
on O
the O
M49 O
UNDP O
codes O
(United O
Nations O
2013 O
: O
Africa, O
North O
America, O
Latin O
America O
and O
the O
Caribbean, O
Asia, O
Australia, O
Europe O
and O
Oceania O
(excluding O
Australia)). O
If O
a O
paper O
listed O
more O
than O
five O
countries, O
we O
labelled O
it O
‘cross-cultural’; O
we O
coded O
each O
sample O
individually O
for O
papers O
with O
one O
to O
four O
geographical O
samples. O
We O
acknowledge O
that O
some O
papers O
could O
have O
an O
explicitly O
‘cross-cultural’ O
goal O
even O
with O
just O
two O
samples, O
for O
example O
studies O
establishing O
measurement O
invariance. O
However, O
our O
focus O
here O
is O
on O
the O
samples O
being O
used O
not O
the O
paper, O
as O
we O
believed O
this O
to O
be O
easier O
to O
assess. O
After O
piloting, O
we O
settled O
on O
the O
following O
eight O
categories O
for O
the O
sample O
participants: O
online O
(paid O
crowdsourced, O
such O
as O
a O
sample O
recruited O
via O
MTurk); O
online O
(unpaid O
crowdsourced, O
such O
as O
a O
sample O
recruited O
via O
Facebook O
or O
Twitter); O
offline O
(western O
child); O
offline O
(western O
student); O
offline O
(western O
non-student O
adult); O
offline O
(non-western O
child); O
offline O
(non-western O
student); O
offline O
(non-western, O
non-student O
adult). O
Online O
studies O
were O
subdivided O
only O
into O
paid O
and O
unpaid O
samples O
given O
the O
focus O
of O
our O
research, O
together O
with O
the O
difficulty O
of O
confirming O
online O
participant O
age, O
student/non-student O
status O
and O
location. O
Samples O
from O
Europe, O
Australia, O
New O
Zealand O
and O
North O
America O
were O
coded O
as O
Western, O
while O
samples O
from O
other O
countries O
coded O
as O
non-Western, O
following O
(Stulp O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
Where O
disagreement O
between O
coders O
existed, O
this O
was O
resolved O
via O
discussion. O

Similarly, O
transferred O
genes O
involved O
in O
detoxification O
may O
protect O
the O
host O
for O
natural O
toxins O
that O
are O
quite O
common O
in O
the O
soil. O
These O
and O
other O
hypotheses O
should O
be O
tested O
by O
conducting O
gene O
knockdown O
and O
other O
experiments. O
We O
have O
provided O
an O
insight O
in O
the O
metagenome O
of O
a O
collembolan O
species, O
F. O
candida. O
Most O
bacterial O
diversity O
is O
attributed O
to O
four O
phyla, O
that O
are O
also O
representative O
for O
soil O
microbial O
ecosystems, O
possibly O
confirming O
the O
interaction O
of O
F. O
candida O
with O
its O
natural O
environment. O
A O
broad O
spectrum O
of O
gene O
functions O
was O
identified, O
most O
notably O
related O
to O
carbohydrate O
metabolism, O
antibiotic O
resistance O
and O
secondary O
metabolite O
production. O
These O
functions O
were O
presented O
and O
discussed O
in O
the O
context O
of O
their O
ecological O
relevance O
and O
in O
the O
light O
of O
potential O
biotechnological O
applications. O
Finally, O
we O
presented O
data O
suggesting O
that O
the O
gut O
microbiome O
may O
have O
been O
a O
source O
of O
genes O
acquired O
by O
the O
host O
through O
HGT. O
These O
genes O
may O
have O
conferred O
a O
fitness O
advantage O
to O
the O
springtail, O
during O
adaptive O
evolution O
in O
the O
soil O
ecosystem. O

Local O
communities O
used O
various O
parts O
of O
these O
trees O
in O
their O
traditional O
practice O
because O
of O
their O
high O
nutritive O
values O
but O
yet O
some O
of O
their O
detailed O
medicinal O
properties O
remain O
unknown. O
The O
plant O
studied, O
Garcinia O
parvifolia O
produces O
cherry-like O
fruit O
which O
is O
locally O
known O
as O
“asam O
kandis” O
or O
“asam O
kundong” O
[ O
3 O
], O
whilst O
the O
young O
leaves O
are O
sometimes O
eaten O
as O
a O
vegetable. O
The O
leaf O
extracts O
of O
this O
plant O
were O
screened O
against O
pseudorabies O
virus O
(PrV). O
It O
is O
a O
broad O
host O
range O
herpesvirus, O
causes O
fatal O
encephalitis O
in O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
animal O
species O
except O
its O
natural O
host, O
the O
adult O
pig O
[ O
4 O
– O
7 O
]. O
Since O
PrV O
is O
not O
a O
human O
pathogen, O
it O
is O
safe O
to O
be O
used O
in O
a O
laboratory O
set-up. O
The O
virus O
can O
easily O
be O
grown O
in O
the O
laboratory O
thus O
it O
is O
practical O
and O
convenient O
to O
be O
used O
in O
the O
screening O
and O
development O
of O
antiviral O
drugs O
or O
compounds. O
G. O
parvifolia O
which O
belongs O
to O
the O
family O
of O
Clusiaceae O
(Guttiferae), O
is O
native O
in O
tropical O
and O
subtropical O
countries O
of O
South O
East O
Asia O
such O
as O
here O
in O
Malaysia, O
Thailand, O
Brunei, O
and O
Indonesia O
[ O

]. O
Garcinia O
is O
known O
to O
produce O
xanthones O
and O
benzophenones O
[ O
9 O
, O
10 O
] O
and O
many O
of O
these O
compounds O
show O
interesting O
biological O
activities O
including O
anti-human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
activity O
[ O
9 O
, O

]. O
There O
are O
at O
least O
300 O
distinct O
Garcinia O
species O
and O
many O
contains O
bioactive O
compounds O
to O
include O
flavonoids, O
xanthones, O
triterpernoids, O
and O
benzophenones O
with O
beneficial O
biological O
activities O
[ O
11 O
– O
14 O
]. O
The O
crude O
extracts O
of O
some O
parts O
of O
G. O
parvifolia O
have O
shown O
antiplasmodial, O
antioxidant, O
cytotoxic O
and O
antibacterial O
activities O
[ O
15 O
]. O
However, O
the O
antiviral O
properties O
of O
the O
G. O
parvifolia O
extract O
are O
not O
known. O
Since O
G. O
parvifolia O
has O
rather O
similar O
properties O
with O
other O
Garcinia O
sp, O
it O
potentially O
has O
antiviral O
activities O
and O
hence O
is O
of O
great O
interest O
to O
test O
in O
the O
current O
study. O

We O
also O
found O
four O
additional O
lysine O

in O
R. O
arrhizus O

(K5A, O

that O

been O
studied O
before, O
and O
could O
potentially O
contribute O
to O
its O
reduced O
caspase-3 O
activation O
(Fig. O

). O
It O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
if O
an O
R. O
arrhizus O
mutant O
with O
A7K O
and O
A25K O
mutations O
shows O
increased O
caspase-3 O
activation O
to O
the O
level O
similar O
to O
that O
of O

since O

Conclusions O
We O
have O
reported O
here O
a O
comparative O
characterization O
of O
R. O

To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
report O
on O
recombinant O

and O
biochemical O
characterization O
of O
the O
R. O
arrhizus O
cyt O
c. O
The O
mitochondrial O

are O
attractive O
targets O
for O

[ O

]. O
A O
better O
understanding O
of O
the O
role O
of O
specific O
sequences O
in O
cyt O
c’s O
ability O
to O
induce O
apoptosis O
and O
its O
differences O
with O
mammalian O
cyt O
c O
could O
lead O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
methods O
for O
exclusive O
targeting O
of O
this O
fungal O
pathogen. O
It O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
if O
the O
amino O
acid O
differences O
in O
cyt O
c O
of O
R. O
arrhizus O
could O
provide O
it O
with O
sufficient O
specificity O
to O
induce O
apoptosis O
exclusively O
in O
fungal O
cells. O
If O
this O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
the O
case, O
designing O
of O
fungi O
specific O
apoptosis O
inducing O
drugs O
may O
be O
possible. O
Although O
results O
of O
targeting O
human O
cancer O
cells O
by O
actively O
inducing O
apoptosis O
using O
mammalian O
cyt O
c O
delivery O
have O
been O
promising O
[ O
28 O
, O
29 O
], O
replicating O
them O
in O
the O
fungal O
cells O
could O
be O
very O
challenging O
due O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
their O
cell O
wall. O
Our O
results O
show O
the O
ability O
of O
R. O
arrhizus O
cyt O
c O
to O
activate O
caspase-3. O
This O
finding O
indicates O
that O
this O
pathogen O
could O
potentially O
use O
a O
similar O
mechanism O
in O

to O
establish O

with O
0.25-cm O

autograft O
pieces O
placed O
into O
the O
holes. O
A O
study O
of O
12 O
patients O
who O
underwent O
this O
procedure O
documented O
the O
so-called O
sandwich O
phenomenon, O
whereby O
the O
skin O
autograft O
migrates O
between O
the O
dermis O
and O
epidermis O
of O
the O
allograft, O
causing O
it O
to O
degenerate O
as O
a O
result O
of O
host O
rejection O
while O
leaving O
the O
autograft O
intact. O
The O
allograft O
thus O
protects O
the O
autograft O
during O
the O
healing O
process. O
Since O
allogenic O
dermis O
is O
slowly O
degraded, O
it O
may O
serve O
as O
a O
scaffold O
to O
promote O
autologous O
dermal O
regeneration O
[ O
6 O
, O
7 O
]. O
The O
ideal O
particulate O
skin O
cover O
is O
allogenic O
skin, O
but O
it O
is O
difficult O
and O
costly O
to O
obtain. O
The O
next O
best O
option O
is O
fresh O
pigskin, O
but O
immune O
rejection O
and O
biosafety O
are O
major O
problems. O
Dermal O
substitutes O
such O
as O
Pelnac O
(Gunze O
Corp., O
Osaka, O
Japan) O
have O
therapeutic O
potential O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
full-thickness O
skin O
wounds O
and O
enhance O
the O
quality O
of O
wound O
healing O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
Pelnac O
consists O
of O
two O
layers: O
a O
porcine O
tendon-derived O
atelocollagen O
sponge O
layer O
and O
silicon O
film O
[ O
10 O
]; O
it O
serves O
as O
scaffolding O
for O
the O
ingrowth O
of O
fibroblasts O
and O
endothelial O
cells, O
which O
contribute O
to O
neodermis O
formation O
and O
thereby O
improve O
wound O
healing O
[ O
11 O
, O
12 O
]. O
However, O
at O
present, O
the O
application O
of O
artificial O
dermis O
requires O
a O
second O
skin O
graft O
operation, O
which O
increases O
patients’ O
discomfort. O
We O
speculated O
that O
since O
artificial O
dermis O
mimics O
the O
scaffold O
structure O
of O
allogenic O
skin, O
it O
can O
be O
used O
as O
an O
overlay O
of O
micrografts O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
as O
allogenic O
skin O
to O
repair O
the O
wound O
in O
a O
single O
operation, O
while O
also O
promoting O
dermal O
and O
epidermal O
regeneration O
and O
collagen O
organization. O
To O
investigate O
the O
above O
possibility, O
in O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
used O
Pelnac O
overlaid O
on O
minced O
split-thickness O
skin O
grafts O
to O
repair O
full-thickness O

in O
a O

Ecotype B-PATH

to O
a O

(Capreolus O

Both O
ecotypes O
are O
most O
probably O
vectored O
by O

In O

was O
for O
example O
not O
the O
one O
found O
in O

[ O

]. O
However, O
due O
to O
scarcity O
of O
studies, O
this O
classification O
in O
ecotypes O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
working O
hypothesis O

rather O
than O
as O
a O

now O
expanding O
their O

towards O
northern O

are O
no O
longer O
limited O
to O
roe O

but O
also O
include O
moose O
(Alces O

Moose O
is O
by O

the O
most O

game O
species O
in O

Moose O
is O
widespread O

the O

Yet, O
we O

about O
the O

In O
the O

Although O
its O

this O

It O
was O

that O
the O

greater O
during O

According O
to O

these O

into O
two O
subfamilies, O
AMT1 O
and O
AMT2. O
AMT1-type O
AMTs O
are O
mainly O

in O

and O
play O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
ammonium O

AMT2-type O
AMTs O
are O
not O
able O

that O
the O

A O
considerable O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
a O
high O
nitrogen O
level O
enhances O
plant O
susceptibility O
to O
biotrophic O
and O
hemibiotrophic O
pathogens, O
known O
as O
nitrogen-induced O

(NIS) O
[ O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
a O
high O
concentration O
of O
nitrogen O
in O
the O
host O
is O
favourable O
for O
nutrient O
acquisition O
by O
pathogens. O
On O
the O

biotrophic O

the O

their O

relatively O

A O
functional O
understanding O

been O
largely O

in O
model O
plants O
such O
as O
tomato O
(Solanum O

SB O
(caused O

Background O
Urinary O

infections O
(UTIs) O
are O
among O
the O
most O
common O
bacterial O
infections O
[ O

] O
and O
affect O
nearly O
half O
of O
all O
women O
at O
least O
once O
in O
their O
lives O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Women O
are O
more O
affected O
than O
men O
and O
exhibit O
two O
incidence O
peaks, O
i.e., O
early O
in O
the O
period O
of O
sexual O
activity O
and O
in O
the O
postmenopausal O
period O
[ O

]. O
Among O
those O
aged O
18 O
years O
and O
over, O
10.8 O
% O
of O
women O
reported O
having O
at O
least O
one O
UTI O
within O
the O
past O
12 O
months O
[ O

]. O
Escherichia B-PATH

(E. O

is O
the O
most O
common O
urinary O
pathogen O
and O
is O
found O
in O
74 O
% O
of O
outpatient O
UTIs O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Antimicrobial O
resistance O
is O
increasing O
and O
varies O
between O
countries, O
and O
this O
variation O
is O
strongly O
related O
to O
antibiotic O
prescription O
practices O
[ O
6 O
– O
9 O
]. O
Initial O
E. B-PATH

are O
followed O
in O
44 O
% O
of O
cases O
by O
recurrence O
within O
12 O
months O
[ O
10 O
]. O
Despite O
this O
burden, O
few O
studies O
have O
examined O
the O
costs O
of O
UTIs. O
In O
1997, O
an O
American O
study O
estimated O
that O
the O
burden O
of O
UTIs O
represented O
100,000 O
hospitalizations, O
7 O
million O
visits O
and O
1 O
million O
admissions O
to O
emergency O
services O
[ O
11 O
]. O
In O
1995, O
UTI O
costs O
were O
estimated O
at O
$1.6 O
billion O
in O
the O
USA O
($659 O
million O
in O
direct O
costs O
and O
$936 O
million O
in O
indirect O
costs) O
[ O
4 O
]. O
The O
direct O
cost O
per O
patient O
has O
been O
estimated O
to O
be O
between O
112 O
and O
172 O
dollars O
[ O
12 O
]. O
In O
France, O
these O
costs O
are O
unknown. O
The O
main O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
calculate O
the O
direct O
and O
indirect O
UTI O
costs O
(including O
cystitis O
and O
acute O
pyelonephritis) O
in O
women O
over O
18 O
years O
of O
age O
who O
visit O
general O
practices O
in O
France. O
The O
secondary O
objectives O
were O
to O
calculate O
the O
costs O
of O
suspected O
UTIs O
with O
negative O
urine O
cultures O
and O
to O
compare O
the O
costs O
of O
UTIs O
due O
to O
antibiotic-resistant O

with O
those O
of O
UTIs O

Methods O
Population O
The O
data O
were O
collected O
during O
the O
Drug O
Resistance O
in O
Community O
Urinary O
Tract O
Infection O
(Druti) O
survey. O

In O
each O
case, O
theories O
were O
initially O
developed O
that O
assumed O
that O
the O
results O
from O
cultures O
more O
familiar O
to O
the O
researchers O
were O
universal. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
some O
research O
topics O
that O
will O
be O
familiar O
to O
readers O
of O
this O
journal O
seem O
to O
be O
those O
for O
which O
we O
have O
good O
evidence O
of O
universality, O
and O
where O
a O
reliance O
on O
less O
diverse O
samples O
is O
less O
problematic. O
Such O
topics O
can O
include O
emotional O
expression O
and O
pride O
displays, O
false O
belief O
tasks, O
some O
mate O
preferences, O
personality O
structure, O
psychological O
essentialism, O
punishment O
of O
free-riders O
and O
social O
relationships O
(Henrich O
et O
al. O
2010 O
). O
Implications O
of O
Relying O
on O
Student O
Samples O
We O
found O
that O
44% O
of O
the O
samples O
that O
we O
coded O
were O
student O
samples O
(137 O
out O
of O
311 O
samples). O
The O
advantages O
of O
using O
student O
samples O
are O
similar O
to O
the O
advantages O
of O
using O
WEIRD O
samples, O
together O
with O
the O
additional O
advantages O
that O
student O
participants O
should O
be O
comfortable O
within O
the O
university O
setting O
and O
accustomed O
to O
following O
task O
instructions O
(Rosenthal O
1965 O
). O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
a O
reliance O
on O
student O
samples O
may O
be O
particularly O
problematic O
when O
dealing O
with O
topics O
where O
there O
is O
a O
clear O
impact O
of O
the O
variables O
that O
distinguish O
students O
from O
the O
general O
population. O
These O
may O
include O
broad O
variables O
such O
as O
age, O
experience, O
socio-economic O
background O
and O
educational O
level, O
as O
well O
as O
more O
specific O
tendencies O
including O
students’ O
greater O
level O
of O
cognitive O
ability O
and O
obedience O
to O
authority, O
more O
transient O
friendships O
and O
still O
nascent O
attitudes O
and O
sense O
of O
self O
(Sears O
1986 O
). O
Areas O
that O
have O
received O
specific O
criticism O
due O
to O
their O
reliance O
on O
student O
sampling O
include O
research O
on O
economic O
decision O
making O
(Levitt O
and O
List O
2007 O
), O
socio-political O
attitudes O
(Schultz O
1969 O
), O
the O
psychological O
processes O
relating O
to O
prejudice O
(Henry O
2008 O
) O
and O
industrial O
and O
organisational O
psychology O
(Bergman O
and O
Jean O
2016 O
). O
Effect O
sizes O
calculated O
from O
student O
data O
can O
differ O
from O
other O
populations O
not O
merely O
in O
magnitude, O
but O
also O
in O
direction O
(Peterson O
2001 O
). O
Further, O
if O
researchers O
are O
interested O
in O
features O
of O
a O
variable O
(e.g. O
its O
range, O
distribution, O
mean), O
then O
it O
will O
not O
be O
possible O
to O
assess O
that O
accurately O
from O
a O
sample O
that O
is O
partially O
selected O
in O
relation O
to O
that O
variable: O
thus, O
population-level O
IQ O
scores O
cannot O
be O
assessed O
from O
student O
samples. O

Indeed, O
eleven O
of O
the O
sixteen O
remaining O
Pol O

subunits O
were O
detected O
in O
pulldowns O
that O
used O

WT O
POLR3B O
whereas O
lower O

of O
each O
of O
these O

relative O
to O

were O
pulled O
down O
using O
POLR3B O
R103H O
(Fig. O

The O
ratio O

six O
of O
these O

showed O
a O
statistically O
significant O
reduction O
in O
the O
mutant O
purifications O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
the O

implying O
a O

for O

in O

and O
a O

underlie O
the O
impaired O
mouse O
embryonic O
development O
phenotype. O
Importantly, O
when O
combined O
with O
our O
previous O
study O
[ O
6 O
], O
our O
data O
suggest O
that O
mutations O
causing O
a O
milder O
effect O
on O
Pol O
III O
function, O
such O
as O
POLR3A O
G672E, O
may O
not O
lead O
to O
a O
phenotype O
in O
mice, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
inter-species O
differences O
in O
myelination O
[ O
6 O
]. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
some O
mutations O
that O
affect O
Pol O
III O
complex O
assembly O
or O
nuclear O
import O
and O
that O
are O
generally O
seen O
as O
compound O
heterozygous O
alleles O
in O
humans O
may O
be O
too O
severe O
in O
the O
homozygous O
state, O
thus O
preventing O
embryonic O
development. O
Indeed, O
numerous O
POLR3-HLD O
cases O
with O
compound O
heterozygous O
alleles O
are O
known O
to O
include O
one O
allele O
with O
a O
frameshift O
or O
nonsense O
mutation O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Since O
we O
have O
only O
studied O
two O
mutations O
thus O
far, O
further O
experiments O
on O
other O
POLR3A O
and O
POLR3B O
mutations O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
confirm O
such O
a O
correlation. O
This O
does O
not O
preclude O
that O
other O
mutations, O
perhaps O
ones O
that O
have O
a O
moderate O
effect O
on O
chromatin O
occupancy O
or O
transcription O
elongation, O
might O
lead O
to O
a O
clinical O
mouse O
phenotype O
recapitulating O
the O
human O
disease. O

As O
shown O
in O
Fig. O

, O
which O

the O
five O
major O

that O

are O
as O
follows: O
N-terminal O
H-domain, O

2+ O
binding O
EF O
hand, O
lipid-binding O
domain, O
heme-binding O
and O
kinase O
domain, O
C-terminal O

domain. O
In O
terms O
of O
the O
MEME-predicted O

the O
N-terminal O

to O
motif O

the O

motif O
2, O
the O
heme-binding O
and O
kinase O
domain O
corresponds O
to O
motif O
3, O
and O
the O
C-terminal O
phosphorylation O
domain O
corresponds O
to O
motif O
5. O
Motif O
4 O
is O
a O
relatively O
weak O

and, O
although O
there O
is O
some O
conservation O
of O
a O
few O

residues O
in O
this O
part O
of O
the O
protein, O
they O
do O
not O
have O
any O
obvious O
functional O
attributes. O
Note O
that, O
as O
discussed O
above, O
the O
H-domain O
is O
not O
always O

but O
the O
other O
four O
key O
domains O
are O
well O

in O
all O

The O
Wixaritari O
called O
mushrooms O
yekwá O
in O
their O
language, O
whereas O
mestizos O
used O
the O
Spanish O
term O
hongos O
(mushrooms). O
Both O
cultural O
groups O
named O
specific O
mushrooms O
based O
on O
their O
ecological O
and O
morphological O
characteristics. O
The O
mestizos O
used O
simple O
or O
compound O
names O
that O
were O
usually O
descriptive O
(Berlin O
1992 O
). O
For O
example, O
chapeteadas, O
meaning O
rosy O
cheeks, O
was O
referred O
to O
the O

On O
the O

hand, O
the O
compound O

often O
began O
with O
the O
shape O
of O
the O
mushrooms, O
such O
as O
oreja O

or O
hongo O
(typical O
mushroom O
with O

followed O
by O
the O

where O
the O
species O
grows, O
for O
instance, O
Volvariella O
bombycina O
is O
called O
hongo O

two O

strongly O
reduced O
by O
the O

is O
a O

the O

genes O
during O
growth O
in O

in O
the O
absence O

results O
in O
a O
high O

for O
S. O
Typhimurium O
23 O

The O

26 O
and O
might O
serve O
as O
an O

to O
trigger O
MI O
degradation. O
During O
growth O
on O
solid O
MM O
medium O
with O
MI, O
strain O
14028 O
exhibits O
a O
reversible O
bistable O
phenotype; O
however, O
this O
phenotype O
is O
absent O
in O
iolR-negative O
strains O
and O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
bicarbonate O
24 O
. O
The O
phenotypic O
bistability O
is O
characterized O
by O
two O
subpopulations O
that O
consist O
of O
either O
proliferating O
or O
nongrowing O
cells. O
This O
phenomenon, O
which O
is O
accompagnied O
by O
a O
hysteresis O
effect, O
could O
be O
correlated O
with O
the O
activity O
of O
one O
of O
the O
iol O
promoters O
(P O
iolE O
) O
that O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
MI O
switches O
from O
the O
“off” O
to O
the O
“on” O
status O
by O
an O

unknown O
mechanism O
24 O
, O

. O
However, O
the O
complex O
regulation O
of O
the O
iol O
genes O
in O
vitro O
or O
in O

is O
not O
yet O
fully O
understood. O
Recently, O
we O
identified O
ReiD, O
which O
is O
encoded O
by O
an O
orphan O
gene O
(STM4423) O
and O
is O
unique O
to O
S. O

As O
a O

some O

On O

although O
the O

of O
some O

might O
be O
lost. O
Even O
so, O
in O

the O
importance O
of O
certain O

was O
so O
great O
that, O
despite O
the O

them. O
Also, O
parallel O
knowledge O
was O
presented O
in O
many O
cases. O
For O
example, O
both O
groups O
were O
able O
to O
detail O
the O
collection, O
phenology, O
and O
ecology O
of O
the O
same O
species O
and O
also O
understood O
the O
role O
of O
fungi O
as O
degraders O
of O
organic O
matter O
and O
as O
essential O
components O
of O
nature O
and O
life-cycle. O
Both, O
consequently, O
understood O
the O
importance O
of O
conserving O
fungi O
species O
and O
their O
ecological O
roles. O
The O
traditional O
ecological O
knowledge O
of O
both O
cultural O
groups O
was O
fundamental O
to O
their O
use O
and O
collection O
practices. O
Knowing O
when O
and O
where O
to O
search O
for O
a O
particular O
species O
had O
enabled O
the O
harvest O
of O
mushrooms O
to O
become O
a O
family O
activity O
and, O
in O
some O
cases, O
a O
recreational O
one. O
The O
practices O
and O
customs O
surrounding O
mushroom O
picking O
have O
functioned O
as O
an O
effective O
means O
of O
transmitting O
knowledge O
concerning O
edible O
mushrooms O
and O
other O
fungi O
found O
during O
collection O
activities. O
Although O
much O
work O
has O
been O
done O
to O
document O
traditional O
knowledge O
and O
uses O
of O
mushrooms O
in O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
(e.g., O
Buyck O
and O
Nzigidahera O
1995 O
; O
Dugan O
2011 O
; O
Yamin-Pasternak O
2011 O
), O
more O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
ensure O
much O
of O
potential O
value O
is O
not O
lost. O
Such O
knowledge O
is O
part O
of O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
peoples, O
and O
so O
the O
cataloguing O
uses, O
linguistics, O
myths, O
and O
harvesting O
can O
prevent O
their O
loss O
as O
modernization O
proceeds O
and O
in O
this O
case, O
by O
the O
dominance O
of O
a O
hegemonic O
culture. O
The O
preservation O
of O
this O
knowledge O
can O
promote O
a O
revaluation O
of O
wild O
mushrooms O
as O
resources O
and O
promote O
their O
conservation. O

In O
addition O
to O
intestinal O
epithelial O
cells, O
the O
epithelium O
includes O
specialized O
cells O
such O
as O
goblet O
cells, O
which O
secrete O
the O
protective O
mucus O
layer, O
limiting O
the O
contact O
between O
bacteria O
and O
epithelial O
cells, O
and O
Paneth O
cells, O
which O
reside O
in O
the O
crypts O
of O
the O
small O
intestine O
and O
secrete O
bactericidal O
peptides O
as O
well O
as O
the O
predominant O
class O
of O
immunoglobulin O
IgA O
was O
also O
found O
in O
intestinal O
secretions O
(Cash O
et O
al., O
2006 O
). O
These O
mucosal O
immune O
responses O
are O
lessened O
when O
exposed O
to O
heat-treated O
bacteria O
in O
comparison O
to O
live O
organisms, O
suggesting O
that O
such O
mechanisms O
involve O
the O
metabolic O
products O
of O
bacterial O
activity O
as O
well O
as O
bacterial O
cell-receptor O
mediated O
sensing O
(Macpherson O
and O
Uhr, O
2004 O
). O
It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
it O
is O
not O
only O
gram-negatives O
and O
lipopolysaccharides O
(LPS) O
that O
can O
induce O
inflammation; O
other O
cell O
components O
and O
metabolites O
can O
be O
involved, O
and O
there O
are O
also O
several O
gram-positive O
pathogenic O
(such O
as O
Enterococcus, O
which O
is O
often O
found O
as O
a O
contaminant O
in O
foods) O
and O
opportunistic O
pathogenic O
bacteria O
(such O
as O
Bifidobacterium) O
that O
can O
induce O
inflammation O
(Gonzalez-Navajas O
et O
al., O
2008 O
). O
An O
endeavour O
searching O
for O
the O
connection O
between O
gut O
microbiota O
and O
systemic O
inflammation O
showed O
that O
approximately O
9% O
of O
the O
total O
variability O
of O
the O
microbiota O
was O
correlated O
to O
the O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
IL-8 O
and O
IL-6 O
(Biagi O
et O
al., O
2010 O
). O
All O
taxa O
that O
showed O
a O
slightly O
positive O
association O
with O
either O
IL-6 O
or O
IL-8 O
belonged O
to O
the O
phylum O
Proteobacteria O
(Biagi O
et O
al., O
2010 O
). O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
low-grade O
systemic O
inflammation O
constitutes O
a O
common O
denominator O
in O
neurodegenerative O
and O
vascular O
diseases, O
possibly O
via O
detrimental O
effects O
on O
the O
vasculature O
and O
leading O
to O
a O
dysfunctional O
brain-blood O
barrier O
and O
inflammatory O
stimuli O
of O
the O
brain. O

In O
this O
case, O
it O
was O
considered O
that O
this O
covS O
mutation O
contributed O
to O
the O
development O
of O
peritonitis O
in O
a O
previously O
healthy O
patient. O
In O
our O
case, O
the O
S. O
pyogenes O
was O
sensitive O
to O
penicillin O
G. O
Therefore, O
we O
used O
penicillin O
G O
and O
clindamycin O
as O
definitive O
therapies. O
We O
also O
used O
linezolid O
until O
the O
pathogen O
was O
identified O
because O
the O
possibility O
of O
community-acquired O
methicillin-resistant O
Staphylococcus O
aureus O
(MRSA) O
involvement O
could O
not O
be O
ruled O
out. O
The O
guidelines O
of O
the O
Infectious O
Disease O
Society O
of O
America O
recommend O
the O
use O
of O
penicillin O
plus O
clindamycin O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
documented O
streptococcal O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
[ O
22 O
]. O
This O
recommendation O
is O
based O
on O
the O
finding O
that O
all O
strains O
of O
S. O
pyogenes O
are O
sensitive O
to O
penicillin O
and O
that O
clindamycin O
suppresses O
S. O
pyogenes O
exotoxin O
and O
M O
protein O
production. O
M O
protein O
is O
an O
important O
molecule O
for O
adhering O
to O
host O
cells; O
furthermore, O
it O
has O
anti-opsonin O
activity, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
resistance O
to O
immunity. O
Moreover, O
the O
guidelines O
show O
that O
empirical O
treatment O
of O
polymicrobial O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
should O
include O
agents O
that O
are O
effective O
against O
both O
aerobes, O
including O
MRSA, O
and O
anaerobes. O
In O
summary, O
we O
report O
a O
rare O
case O
of O
secondary O
necrotizing O
fasciitis O
following O
primary O
peritonitis O
with O
a O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
infection O
in O
a O
previously O
healthy O
woman. O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
primary O
peritonitis O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
the O
differential O
diagnosis O
of O
gastrointestinal O
symptoms, O
even O
in O
healthy O
women. O
In O
these O
cases, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
detect O
the O
pathogen O
underlying O
peritonitis O
through O
abdominocentesis O
or O
a O
diagnostic O
laparotomy. O
Subsequently, O
antibiotic O
therapy O
should O
be O
initiated O
promptly. O
Because O
S. B-PATH
pyogenes I-PATH
with O
mutated O
covS O
may O
spread O
immediately O
from O
the O
upper O
respiratory O
tract, O
the O
vagina, O
or O
a O
peripheral O
injection O
site O
to O
the O
organs, O
rapid O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
are O
required. O

PLG O
receptors O
are O
distributed O
broadly O
on O
many O
types O
of O
cells, O
including O
monocytes, O
macrophages, O
endothelial O
cells, O
and O
platelets O
[ O
16 O
]. O
The O
proteolytic O
functions O
of O
PLG O
allow O
it O
to O
degrade O
extracellular O
matrices O
and O
activate O
growth O
factors O
that O
aid O
in O
cell O
migration. O
Studies O
with O
PLG O
−/− O
mice O
have O
shown O
that O
monocytes O
and O
macrophages O
have O
an O
impaired O
ability O
to O
migrate O
to O
the O
peritoneum O
when O
thioglycollate, O
an O
inducer O
of O
neutrophils, O
granulocytes, O
monocytes, O
and O
lymphocytes, O
is O
injected O
[ O
18 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
mice O
with O
increased O
plasmin O
activity O
due O
to O
knockout O
of O
alpha-2-antiplasmin, O
a O
plasmin O
inhibitor, O
have O
increased O
macrophage O
recruitment O
in O
the O
thioglycollate O
injection O
model O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Moreover, O
macrophage O
recruitment O
is O
suppressed O
when O
mice O
are O
given O
tranexamic O
acid, O
a O
lysine O
analog O
that O
inhibits O
PLG, O
in O
their O
drinking O
water O
[ O
19 O
]. O
These O
various O
studies O
linking O
PLG O
to O
immune O
cell O
migration O
led O
to O
a O
proteomics-based O
search O
for O
a O
migration-specific O
receptor O
for O
PLG, O
leading O
to O
the O
discovery O
and O
characterization O
of O
PLG-R O
KT O
[ O
20 O
]. O
A O
PLG-R O
KT O
monoclonal O
antibody O
inhibits O
invasion O
of O

in O

into O
a O

to O
a O
chemotactic O
stimulus, O
MCP-1, O
and O
in O

in O
a O
thioglycollate O
model O
[ O
21 O
], O
and O
this O
regulation O
of O
chemotactic O
migration O
appears O
specific O
to O
PLG-R O
KT O
[ O
20 O
]. O
We O
show O
that O
PLG-R O
KT O
is O
expressed O
broadly O
on O
many O
types O
of O
immune O
cells O
in O
our O
mouse O
line, O
including O
IP O
macrophages, O
blood O
monocytes, O
and O
PVMs. O
PVMs O
are O
replenished O
by O
bone O
marrow-derived O
cells O
[ O
22 O
] O
and O
are O
phagocytic O
cells O
that O
have O
a O
close O
association O
to O
the O
cerebral O

[ O

As O
obligate O
or O
facultative O
insect O
pathogens, O
entomopathogenic O
bacteria O
display O
different O
host O
ranges O
and O
mechanisms O
of O
infection; O
however, O
all O
of O
them O
have O
similar O
abilities O
to O
produce O
a O
huge O
repertoire O
of O

factors O
to O
overcome O
insect O

and O

(Boemare O

). O
Photorhabdus O

bacteria O
exhibit O
another O
essential O
feature: O
as O

symbionts O
of O
infective O
juveniles O
(IJs) O
of O
entomopathogenic O
nematodes O
(EPNs) O
from O
the O

Heterorhabditis, O
respectively, O
they O
spend O
some O

inside O
nematodes O
using O
them O
as O
a O
vector O
for O

Nematodes O

a O

In O

Heterorhabditis O
nematodes, O
which O
do O

use O

The O
life O
cycle O
of O
all O
EPN O
microsymbionts O
is O
similar O
and O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
three O
phases: O
phoretic O
in O

in O
the O

In O

Its O
particular O
virulence O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
product O
of O
a O
number O
of O
adaptations. O
Well O
described O
are: O
the O
expression O
of O

which O
assist O

and O
colonisation; O
the O
ability O

of O
a O
peptostreptococcal O
albumin-binding O

Whilst O
the O
infections O
above O
due O

F. O

appear O
to O
be O
relatively O
common, O
confirmed O
infective O
endocarditis O
due O
to O
F. O
magna O
is O
notably O
more O
rare. O
A O
search O
of O
the O
English-language O

reveals O
eight O
previously O
reported O
cases O
of O
endocarditis O
with O
F. B-PATH
magna I-PATH
or O
P. B-PATH
magnus I-PATH
as O
the O

Of O
note, O
blood O

were O
negative O
in O
the O

cases, O
with O
definitive O

made O
only O
by O

a O
positive O

after O

Culture-negative O
infective O

has O
a O
potentially O
negative O
impact O
on O

management, O
as O
this O
can O
lead O

Discussion O
It O
is O
generally O
accepted O
that O
bacterial O
sRNAs O
are O
regulators O
of O
gene O
expression O
and O
perform O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
physiological O
functions. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
cis-encoded O
antisense O
RNAs, O
trans-encoded O
sRNAs O
typically O
range O
from O
50 O
to O
300 O
nucleotides, O
and O
exhibit O
only O
imperfect O
complementarity O
with O
their O
RNA O
target O
48 O
, O
49 O
. O
Two O
modes O
of O
action O
by O
which O
those O
noncoding O
RNAs O
modulate O
gene O
expression O
are O
most O
common. O
One O
class O
of O
sRNAs O
can O
directly O
interact O
with O
a O
protein O
to O
modify O
its O
activity O
50 O
, O
51 O
, O
whereas O
the O
other O
base-pairs O
imperfectly O
in O
an O
Hfq-dependent O
manner O
with O
cognate O
mRNA O
targets O
and O
thus O
inhibits O
initiation O
by O
masking O
the O
ribosomal O
binding O
site O
followed O
by O
mRNA O
destabilization O
via O
RNAse O
E, O
or O
liberate O
a O
sequestered O
RBS, O
a O
mechanism O
termed O
anti-antisense O
that O
results O
in O
translational O
activation O
44 O
, O
52 O
. O
In O
S. O
Typhimurium, O
sRNAs O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
regulating O
virulence O
and O
metabolic O
properties O
32 O
. O
Examples O
of O
the O
latter O
category O
are O
the O
control O
of O
amino O
acid O
metabolism O
including O
the O
branched O
chain O
amino O
acids O
via O
GcvB O
53 O
, O
the O
role O
of O
SgrS O
in O
glucose O
homeostasis O
54 O
– O
57 O
, O
and O
uptake O
of O
chitin-derived O
oligosaccharides O
involving O
ChiX O
35 O
. O
Recently, O
a O
detailed O
transcriptome O
analysis O
of O
S. O
Typhimurium O
growing O
in O
a O
set O
of O
environmental, O
stress O
or O
gut O
mimicking O
conditions O
revealed O
the O
expression O
of O
280 O
sRNAs O
30 O
. O
However, O
the O
functional O
characterization O
of O
many O
remains O
incomplete. O
Here, O
we O
present O
the O
characterization O
of O
a O
sRNA O
termed O
RssR O
that O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
MI O
degradation O
pathway O
in O
S. O
Typhimurium. O
We O
found O
that O
the O
sRNA O
RssR, O
whose O
gene O
rssR O
overlaps O
with O
the O
coding O
region O
and O
the O
3′-UTR O
of O
iolB, O
probably O
interacts O
with O
and O
stabilizes O
the O
mRNA O
of O
reiD O
via O
interaction O
with O
the O
5′-UTR, O
thus O
controlling O
the O
expression O
of O
this O
regulatory O
gene O
at O
the O
posttranscriptional O
level. O

The O
prospect O
of O
delaying O
or O
preventing O
the O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
is O
feasible O
and O
within O
our O
grasp. O
However, O
this O
mission O
must O
surmount O
a O
number O
of O
barriers, O
which O
contain O
inadequate O
funding O
of O
research, O
high O
cost O
of O
clinical O
studies, O
lack O
of O
suitable O
infrastructure, O
better O
models, O
antiquated O
administrative O
structure O
of O
discovery O
programs, O
and O
arcane O
decision-making O
systems O
for O
selecting O
and O
funding O
innovative O
ideas. O
Recently, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
know O
for O
certain O
that O
someone O
has O
AD O
is O
to O
examine O
an O
autopsy O
of O
their O
brains O
tissue O
after O
death. O
The O
crucial O
challenge O
for O
the O
AD O
researches O
is O
how O
to O
understand O
the O
process O
of O
neurodegenerative O
disorders O
throughout O
the O
patient’s O
lifetime. O
Additionally, O
the O
lack O
of O
efficient O
cultivation O
techniques O
stems O
from O
many O
factors O
that O
largely O
remain O
unknown O
(Lopez O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
Hence, O
molecular O
ecology O
and O
metagenomics O
have O
significantly O
increased O
our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
genetic O
diversity O
and O
have O
led O
to O
interesting O
hypotheses O
(Hugenholtz O
and O
Tyson, O
2008 O
). O
The O
advanced O
techniques O
have O
also O
revealed O
how O
far O
we O
are O
from O
measuring O
the O
full O
extent O
of O
genetic O
diversity O
encoded O
by O
microbial O
life O
(Hugenholtz O
and O
Tyson, O
2008 O
; O
Pignatelli O
et O
al., O
2008 O
). O
Summary O
Microbial O
colonization O
of O
the O
gut O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
the O
postnatal O
development O
and O
maturation O
of O
the O
immune, O
endocrine O
and O
even O
neural O
systems, O
these O
processes O
are O
key O
factors O
underpinning O
CNS O
signalling. O
Indeed, O
understanding O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
is O
important O
in O
relation O
to O
inflammation O
and O
metabolic O
diseases O
that O
have O
a O
direct O
relation O
to O
the O
AD O
pathogenesis. O
Moreover, O
comparative O
analysis O
of O
gut O
microbiota O
may O
enable O
further O
novel O
vision O
into O
the O
complex O
biology O
of O
AD, O
which O
is O
very O
important O
in O
order O
to O
take O
preventive O
measure O
such O
as O
early O
diagnosis, O
identification O
of O
new O
therapeutic O
targets O
and O
development O
of O
novel O
drugs. O
Thus, O
modulation O
of O
gut O
microbiota O
(by O
probiotics O
or O
other O
dietary O
intervention) O
or O
direct O
targeting O
of O
gut O
microbiota O
enzymes O
(by O
pharmacological O
inhibitors O
or O
activators) O
may O
be O
a O
growing O
area O
for O
pharmaceutical O
and O
functional O
food O
industries, O
with O
the O
goal O
of O
decreasing O
the O
widespread O
growth O
of O
adiposity, O
insulin O
resistance, O
AD, O
and O
other O
metabolic O
diseases. O

Microbiota O
affect O
the O
development O
of O
the O
gut O
associated O
lymphoid O
system O
(GALT). O
The O
intestines O
contains O
70% O
of O
the O
body’s O
circulating O
lymphocytes, O
many O
of O
which O
are O
found O
within O
the O
epithelium O
(Collins O
et O
al., O
2012 O
). O
In O
the O
lamina O
propria O
there O
are O
several O
lines O
of O
immune O
cells, O
key O
to O
the O
host O
response O
to O
microbiota, O
such O
as O
macrophages, O
dendritic O
cells O
and O
myofibroblasts O
(Otte O
et O
al., O
2003 O
; O
Bilsborough O
and O
Viney, O
2004 O
). O
Gut O
lymphoid O
tissue, O
and O
surface O
and O
circulating O
immunoglobulin O
concentrations O
show O
a O
substantial O
rise O
in O
observation O
of O
bacterial O
addition O
to O
the O
gut O
(Macpherson O
and O
Harris, O
2004 O
). O
In O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
human O
life O
cycle, O
pioneering O
species O
in O
the O
gut O
interact O
through O
surface O
cell O
receptors O
on O
the O
immune O
cells O
of O
the O
gut, O
such O
as O
caspase-recruitment-domain O
protein O
(CARD), O
and O
toll-like O
receptors O
(TLRs), O
to O
promote O
the O
expression O
of O
host O
genes O
that O
generate O
an O
intraluminal O
and O
mucosal O
environment O
that O
further O
favors O
their O
colonization O
(Silva O
et O
al., O
1987 O
; O
Hooper O
et O
al., O
2001 O
). O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
TLRs O
there O
is O
another O
family O
of O
membrane-bound O
receptors O
for O
detection O
of O
proteins O
called O
NOD-like O
receptors O
(NLRs). O
NRLs O
are O
located O
in O
the O
cytoplasm O
and O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
detection O
of O
bacterial O
pathogen-associated O
molecular O
patterns O
(PAMPs) O
that O
enter O
the O
mammalian O
cell. O
NRLs O
are O
especially O
important O
in O
tissues O
where O
TLRs O
are O
expressed O
at O
low O
levels O
(Philpott O
et O
al., O
2001 O
). O

After O
vaginal O
delivery, O
the O
neonatal O
microbiota O
resembles O
the O
mother’s O
vaginal O
microbiota O
and O
is O
undifferentiated O
across O
anatomical O
sites O
[ O
23 O
], O
but O
subsequently O
becomes O
shaped O
by O
the O
selective O
pressure O
of O
site-specific O
factors O
and O
by O
3 O
years O
of O
age, O
an O
adult-like O
intestinal O
microbiota O
dominated O
by O
Firmicutes O
or O
Bacteroidetes O
is O
established. O
After O
this O
age, O
the O
microbiome O
composition O
in O
a O
healthy O
individual O
reaches O
a O
relatively O
stable O
state O
with O
minor O
fluctuations O
in O
physiological O
conditions, O
but O
strong O
and O
prolonged O
perturbations O
can O
occur O
in O
disease O
conditions O
or O
with O
antibiotics. O
At O
the O
species O
level O
there O
is O
enormous O
inter-individual O
heterogeneity O
in O
gut O
microbiomes, O
which O
has O
hindered O
efforts O
for O
clearly O
defining O
a O
core O
microbiome O
shared O
between O
healthy O
individuals. O
It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
functional O
capacity O
of O
the O
microbiota, O
as O
depicted O
by O
abundances O
of O
genes O
involved O
in O
metabolic O
pathways, O
could O
constitute O
a O
metric O
better O
suited O
to O
define O
a O
core O
healthy O
microbiota O
[ O
19 O
, O
24 O
]. O
Indeed, O
the O
basic O
categories O
of O
metabolic O
pathways O
were O
more O
evenly O
represented O
across O
individuals O
as O
compared O
to O
bacterial O
taxonomy O
[ O
19 O
]. O
It O
remains O
to O
be O
determined O
whether O
this O
shared O
set O
of O
metabolic O
pathways O
is O
the O
major O
characteristic O
of O
a O
healthy O
microbiota. O
Next O
generation O
sequencing O
methods O
in O
microbiome O
studies O
Culturing O
of O
bacterial O
strains O
has O
been O
central O
to O
classical O
microbiology O
and O
has O
enabled O
the O
study O
of O
individual O
pathogens O
and O
some O
commensal O
bacteria. O
For O
most O
commensal O
bacteria, O
culture O
methods O
had O
not O
been O
optimized O
for O
their O
in O
vitro O
isolation O
and O
study. O
With O
recent O
improvements O
in O
methodology, O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
commensal O
bacteria O
is O
now O
considered O
culturable O
[ O
25 O
, O
26 O
]. O
Culturomics O
is O
a O
strategy O
which O
incorporates O
multiple O
culture O
conditions, O
coupled O
with O
MALDI-TOF O
mass O
spectrometry O
and/or O
16S O
ribosomal O
RNA O
(rRNA) O
or O
total O
genome O
sequencing O
for O
bacterial O
identification O
[ O
27 O
, O
28 O
]. O
This O
high-throughput O
approach O
can O
enable O
isolation O
and O
identification O
of O
commensals O
for O
further O
manipulation O
and O
mechanistic O
studies. O

High O
levels O
of O

HCV-HIV O
co-infection O
among O

have O
been O
documented O
previously O
in O
the O
Amazon O
region O
[ O
17 O
, O
24 O
, O
29 O
, O
51 O
]. O
These O
dynamics O
likely O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
associations O
of O
unprotected O
sexual O

with O
HCV O

status O
in O
the O

An O

by O

in O
the O

will O
be O
carried O
out O
separately O
to O
further O
examine O
this O
comprehensive O
epidemiological-virological O
picture. O
The O
present O
study O
has O
a O
number O
of O
possible O
limitations. O
One O
limiting O
factor O
was O
the O
age O
limit O
criterion O
(18 O
years) O
applied O
for O
eligible O
participants, O
since O
many O
PWUIDs O
report O
an O
onset O
of O
illicit O
drug O
use O
at O
ages O
&lt; O
18 O
years. O
Second, O
the O
restriction O
of O
the O
study O
to O
the O
municipalities O
of O
the O
Amazon O
region O
renders O
the O
study O
sample O
not O
necessarily O
representative O
of O
the O
PWUIDs O
population O
in O
Northern O
Brazil O
more O
generally. O
In O
addition, O
although O
snowball O
sampling O
has O
been O
found O
to O
be O
adequate O
for O
quasi-representative O
sampling O
in O
hidden O
populations, O
could O
have O
been O
used O
to O
improve O
representativeness. O
As O
the O
interview O
data O
are O
self-reported, O
some O
information, O
such O
as O
drug O
use O
or O
sex-related O
risks O
behaviors, O
may O
contain O
response O
or O
recall O
bias. O
Screening O
for O
HCV O
infection O
was O
based O
on O
EIA, O
recent O
infections O
may O
present O
a O
small O
concentration O
of O
anti-HCV O
antibodies, O
not O
yet O
detected O
by O
EIA, O
and O
therefore O
may O
have O
been O
diagnosed O
as O
negative. O
Finally, O
the O
cross-sectional O
design O
of O
the O
study O
limits O
its O
capacity O
to O
establish O
causality. O
Conclusions O
The O
present O
study O
is O
the O
first O
epidemiological O

of O
HCV O

and O

Indeed, O
recent O

has O
begun O
to O
examine O
and O
retrace O
the O
specific O
genetic O
changes O
that O
were O
necessary O
for O
the O

8 O
, O
9 O
, O
10 O
, O
11 O
. O
This O
change O
in O
disease O
and O
transmission O
is O
attributed O
to O
both O
the O
acquisition O
of O
new O
chromosomal O
and O
extrachromosomal O
DNA O
and O
as O
well O
as O
through O
genomic O

12 O
. O
For O
example, O
the O
genes O
encoding O
for O
O-antigen O
synthesis O
on O
its O
lipopolysaccharide O
are O
inactivated O
in O
Y. O
pestis, O
resulting O
in O
a O
rough O
form O
of O
lipopolysaccharide O
13 O
. O
Y. O
pestis O
also O
contains O
disruptions O
in O
the O
genes O
for O
the O
adhesins O
invasin O
and O
YadA O
14 O
, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
functional O
in O
Y. O
pseudotuberculosis O
15 O
, O
16 O
. O
Furthermore, O
a O
recent O
study O
by O
Sun O
et O
al. O
7 O
has O
described O
only O
four O
minor O
genetic O
changes O
that O
were O
necessary O
for O
the O
flea-borne O
transmission O
of O
Y. O
pestis, O
which O
contributed O
directly O
to O
the O
ability O
of O
this O
pathogen O
to O
cause O
bubonic O
plague. O
In O
addition, O
the O
gain O
of O
the O
two O
plasmids O
pMT1 O
and O
pPCP1 O
that O
encode O
genes O
contributing O
directly O
to O
survival O
and O
virulence O
in O
both O
the O
flea O
and O
mammal O
is O
an O
apparent O

The O
cell O

is O
very O
important O
for O
S. O

to O
maintain O
an O
osmotic O

and O
a O
thickened O
cell O
wall O
is O
often O
related O
to O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
cell O

S. O

is O
encapsulated O
by O
capsular O

which O
can O
protect O

Two-component O

basic O

allow O
organisms O
to O
sense O
and O
respond O
to O
changes O
in O
many O

Typical O
TCSs O
have O
two O
components, O
a O
histidine O
protein O
kinase O
and O
a O

regulator. O
The O
kinase O
senses O
the O
environmental O
stimuli, O
autophosphorylates O
at O
a O
histidine O
residue, O
and O
transfers O
the O
phosphoryl O
to O
an O
aspartate O
residue O
in O
the O

regulator. O
Then O
the O
regulator O
is O
active O
to O

downstream O

[ O

Bioinformatics O

indicates O
that O
S. O

TCSs. O
In O
many O
cases, O
virulence O

such O
as O
the O
well-studied O
AgrAC O
[ O

and O

[ O

In O
addition O

the O

are O
involved O
in O
the O

of O

In O

a O

TCS O
for O
its O
role O

Recently, O
WalKR O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
vancomycin O

[ O

]. O
By O
introducing O
a O

of O
WalK, O
S. O
aureus O
exhibited O
reduced O
susceptibility O

vancomycin O
[ O

The O

However, O
when O
growing O
on O
MM, O
RBM O
or O

medium, O
ETF O

ETFDH O
mutants O
produced O
about O
8–10% O
conidia O
of O
Guy11 O
( O
Figs O

We O
speculated O
the O
difference O
between O
CM O
and O
other O
simple O
media O
of O
MM, O
RBM O
and O
SDC O
likely O
induced O
different O
nutrition O

on O
the O

These O
results O
suggested O
that O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
were O
involved O
in O
growth O
and O
conidiation O
by O
M. O
oryzae. O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
are O
defective O
in O
fatty O

As O
reported O
in O

ETF O

mutation O
could O
impact O
upstream O
fatty O

and O
cause O
metabolic O
diseases O
19 O

. O
To O
investigate O
the O
effect O
of O
M. O
oryzae O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
deletion O
on O
fatty O
acid O
metabolism, O
we O
determined O
the O
mutant O
ability O
to O
utilize O
exogenous O
fatty O
acids O
as O
the O
sole O
carbon O
source. O
Since O
mitochondrial O
β O
oxidation O
of O
fatty O
acids O
is O
generally O
responsible O
for O
degrading O
fatty O
acids O
with O
&lt;20 O
carbons O
17 O
, O
several O
fatty O
acids O
with O
different O
carbon O
length O
from O

to O
C18 O
were O
added O
to O
the O
carbon-deficient O

to O
test O
the O

Our O
results O
showed O
that, O
when O
growing O
on O
butyrate O
(C4), O
hexanoic O
(C6), O
octanoic O
(C8) O
or O
lauric O
(C12) O
as O
sole O
carbon O
source, O
the O
growth O
of O
ETF O
and O
ETFDH O
mutants O
was O
apparently O
inhibited O
in O
comparison O
to O
that O
of O
Guy11 O
( O

However, O
when O
growing O
on O
acetate O
(C2) O
and O
oleic O
(C18) O
as O
sole O
carbon O
source, O
ETF O

displayed O
no O

from O

after O

for O
10 O
days. O

In O
accordance O
with O
previous O
results O
obtained O
with O
meliacine O
[ O
5 O
], O
addition O
of O
CDM O
to O
cells O
after O
HSV-2 O
infection O
caused O
a O
strong O
inhibition O
of O
virus O
titer O
in O
the O
order O
of O
100 O
fold O
(Figure O
3c O
). O
Unexpectedly, O
when O
CDM O
was O
present O
for O
16 O
h O
before O
infection O
and O
for O
24 O
h O
afterwards, O
virus O
yield O
was O
reduced O
20.000 O
times O
(Figure O
3d O
). O
This O
high O
antiviral O
activity O
of O
CDM O
per O
se O
complicated O
the O
interpretation O
of O
the O
results O
obtained O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
IFN O
(Figure O
3d O
), O
which O
in O
comparison O
reduced O
the O
amount O
of O
virus O
even O
in O
combination O
less O
than O
2 O
logs. O
To O
overcome O
this O
inconvenience, O
we O
performed O
an O
experiment O
with O
lower O
concentrations O
of O
CDM O
added O
after O
virus O
infection O
and O
lasted O
to O
virus O
harvest, O
in O
combination O
with O
100 O
IU/ml O
of O
IFN-α O
or O
IFN-γ. O
A O
clear O
additive O
effect O
of O
CDM O
with O
IFN-α O
or O
CDM O
plus O
IFN-γ O
at O
all O
concentrations O
tested O
was O
observed O
(Figure O
4 O
). O
Thus, O
the O
results O
reported O
here O
indicated O
that O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM O
did O
not O
alter O
the O
biological O
activity O
of O
IFN-α O
or O
IFN-γ O
or O
their O
combination. O
As O
a O
result O
we O
can O
envision O
that O
the O
administration O
of O
CDM O
in O
vivo O
could O
not O
affect O
the O
production O
of O
IFNs, O
which O
are O
so O
important O
mediators O
on O
the O
innate O
resistance O
to O
HSV-2 O
infection O
[ O
19 O
]. O
Conclusion O
We O
have O
shown O
here O
that O
IFN-α, O
together O
with O
IFN-γ O
synergistically O
inhibits O
the O
replication O
of O
HSV-2 O
in O

like O
it O
was O
also O
demonstrated O
for O
HSV-1 O
and O
others O
DNA O
and O
RNA O
viruses. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
we O
have O
shown O
too O
that O
CDM O
display O
a O
high O
antiviral O
activity O
against O
HSV-2 O
without O
interfering O
with O
the O
biological O
activity O
of O
IFN. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
in O
vivo O
administration O
of O
CDM O
could O
not O
affect O
the O
antiviral O
activity O
of O
interferons O
to O
inhibit O
HSV-2 O
replication O
in O
the O
mice O

In O

However, O
chronic, O

The O

A O
recent O

between O

In O

At O

the O
prebiotic-induced O

resulted O
in O
a O

Furthermore, O
the O

with O
the O

the O

distribution O
of O

at O
the O

there O
may O

some O

This O
is O

that O

at O
the O

at O

In O
addition, O
these O

that O

suggesting O
that O

This O

it O
was O

whether O

Miyairi O

We O
reasoned O
that O
in O

treatment, O
the O
REGγ-IkBɛ O
regulation O
may O
impinge O
upon O
an O
‘acute O

of O

therefore, O
lead O
to O
an O
enhanced O

To O
validate O
this, O
we O
silenced O
IκBɛ O
with O

(acute O

This O
‘acute O
depletion O

did O
not O

Discussion O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
proteasome O
activator O
REGγ O
is O
a O
regulatory O
factor O
involved O
in O
bowel O
inflammation O
and O
CAC O
development O
in O

models. O
Impaired O
integrity O
of O

barrier O
and O

of O
NFκB-enhanced O
intestinal O

further O
enhance O
NFκB O
signalling O
by O
negatively O
regulating O
IκBɛ O
and O
promoting O
cytokine O
and O

( O

Depletion O
of O
REGγ O
alleviates O
the O
severity O
of O
experimental O
colitis O
and O
CAC O
in O
an O
IκBɛ-dependent O
manner. O
Figure O

A O
schematic O
model O
depicts O
the O
reciprocal O
regulation O
between O
REGγ O
and O
NFκB. O
Inflammatory O
injury O
impairs O
integrity O
of O
the O
epithelial O
barrier, O
triggering O
initial O
activation O
of O
NFκB, O
which O
promotes O
expression O
of O
IκBɛ O
and O
REGγ. O
Elevated O
REGγ O
enhances O
degradation O
of O
IκBɛ O
protein O
in O
a O
ubiquitin-independent O
manner, O
neutralizing O
its O
ability O
to O
inhibit O
NFκB, O
thus O
leading O
to O
further O
elevation O
of O
REGγ O
and O
activation O
of O
NFκB. O
The O
reciprocal O
regulation O
between O
REGγ O
and O
NFκB O
via O
IκBɛ O
constitutes O
a O
novel O
regulatory O
circuit O
with O
the O
potential O
for O
positive O
feedback O
that O
can O
lead O
to O
run-away O

In O

The O

of O

the O

[ O

The O
active O

provides O
quick O

easy O
access O

and O
so O
provides O
increased O
risk O

to O
HCV O

Moreover, O
those O

HCV O
to O
other O
users O
through O
the O

The O
possibility O

has O
been O
demonstrated O
by O
studies O
in O

The O

remains O
a O
phenomenon O

Functional O

these O

be O
conducive O
to O

In O
the O

These O

These O

It O
must O
be O
emphasized O
that O
small O

may O
affect O
the O

Thus, O
the O

the O

The O

Background O
Sepsis O
is O
still O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
mortality O
over O
the O
world O
[ O
1 O

2 O
]. O
A O
recent O
systematic O
review O
reported O
an O
annual O
incidence O
of O
256 O
hospital-treated O
sepsis O
cases O
per O
100,000 O
person O
and O
per O
year O
[ O

]. O
It O
represents O
nearly O
10% O
of O
intensive O

admissions, O
with O
an O
average O
ICU O
mortality O
of O

and O
a O
22% O
in-hospital O
mortality O
regardless O
of O
the O
source O
of O

[ O

Sepsis O
management-related O

accounted O
for O
5.2% O

in O
2011 O
[ O

Distinct O
phases O
of O
hemodynamic O
resuscitation O
have O
been O
described O
with O
different O
risks, O
goals, O
and O
challenges: O
resuscitation, O
optimization, O
stabilization, O
and O
de-escalation O
phases O
[ O
6 O
]. O
Fluid O
therapy O
represents O
one O
of O
the O
cornerstones O
of O
resuscitation O
treatments O
in O
order O
to O
increase O
oxygen O
delivery O
during O
circulatory O
failure O
[ O
7 O
]. O
During O
the O
salvation O
phase O
of O
septic O
shock, O
the O
current O
guidelines O
suggest O
that O
an O
aggressive O
fluid O
resuscitation O
is O
the O
best O
initial O
therapy O
[ O
8 O
]. O
During O
the O
optimization O
phase, O
the O
goal O
is O
to O
maintain O
adequate O
tissue O
perfusion O
and O
avoid O
the O
effects O
of O
fluid O
overload. O
During O
this O
phase, O
“liberal” O
or O
uncontrolled O
fluid O
therapy O
can O
induce O
an O
increased O
positive O
fluid O
balance O
with O
tissue O
fluid O
overload O
leading O
to O
potential O
harmful O
effects O
[ O
9 O
– O
12 O
]. O
A O
restrictive O
fluid O
therapy O
strategy O
could O
be O
used O
to O
decrease O
fluid O
overload O
(FO) O
during O
the O
optimization O
phase O
in O
septic O
shock O
patients O
[ O
13 O
]. O
It O
is O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
inappropriate O
use O
of O
fluid O
therapy O
can O
induce O
its O
own O
side O
effects. O
Therefore, O
a O
paradigm O
shift O
is O
currently O
occurring O
as O
concerns O
have O
been O
raised O
about O
the O
potential O
adverse O
effects O
of O
fluid O
therapy. O
Fluid O
overload O
is O
one O
of O
the O
major O
adverse O
effects O
reported O
and O
an O
independent O
factor O
of O
worse O
outcome O
in O
intensive O
care O
unit O
(ICU) O
patients O
[ O
10 O
]. O
It O
is O
now O
suggested O
that O
fluid O
administration O
should O
be O
conducted O
cautiously O
to O
avoid O
an O
unnecessary O
increase O
in O
fluid O
intake O
but O
ensure O
an O
adequate O
tissue O
perfusion. O
A O
patient O
goal-directed O
therapy O
may O
help O
to O
optimize O
fluid O
intake O
and O
avoid O
the O
deleterious O
effects O
of O
an O
increased O
fluid O
balance O
[ O

]. O

These O
effects O
cover O
the O
three O

Furthermore, O
levels O
of O
P450 O
proteins O
of O
the O
Cyp2b, O

were O
reduced O
by O
20–60%, O
with O
similar O
trends O
for O
Cyp2c, O
2d O

These O
changes O
were O
reflected O
in O
60–70% O
decreases O
in O
clearance O
of O
four O
P450 O

The O

(Silva O

In O

(Philpott O

In O
summary, O
the O

technique, O
which O
facilitates O
analysis O
of O
key O
metabolic O
proteins, O

simultaneously. O
Traditional O
methods O
assess O

which O
lack O
the O
ability O
to O
identify O
metabolic O
profile O
differences O
in O

on O
a O
single-cell, O
protein O
level. O
These O
methods O
can O
mask O
important O
attributes O
specific O
to O
infrequent O
populations O
and O
may O
not O
account O
for O
heterogeneity O
in O
cellular O
subsets. O
Using O
Met-Flow, O
we O
simultaneously O
captured O
dynamic O
metabolic O
states O
across O
multiple O
immune O
populations. O
This O
was O
combined O
with O
methods O
of O

The O
expansion O

this O

Introduction O
The O
immune O
status O
of O
a O
given O
cell O
type O
is O
defined O
by O
its O
underlying O
metabolic O

Leukocytes O
utilize O

to O
coordinate O
immune-specific O
gene O

at O
the O
epigenetic, O

post-transcriptional, O
and O
post-translational O
levels. O
In O

In O
the O

Conversely, O
formation O

requires O

This O

However, O
these O
technologies O
are O
largely O

There O
are O
additional O

we O
cloned O
the O

The O
purified O
cyt O

with O
two O

We O
selected O
R. O
arrhizus O
cyt O
c O
as O
a O
candidate O
for O
this O

mainly O
for O
two O
reasons. O
First, O
this O

cyt O
c O
is O
distantly O

to O
mammalian O
cyt O
c O
and O
its O
biochemical O
properties O

Secondly, O
R. O
arrhizus O
is O
a O
pathogenic O
fungus O
and O
any O
information O
gained O
on O
the O
pro-apoptotic O
activity O
of O
cyt O
c O
may O
also O
contribute O
to O
the O
identification O

We O
found O
that O
cyt O

has O
similar O
biochemical O

to O
mammalian O

Background O
Klebsiella B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
is O
a O
threatening O
human O
pathogen O
that O
causes O
various O
diseases, O
including O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infections, O
blood O
infections, O
and O
liver O
abscesses O
[ O

Traditionally, O
bacterial O
infections O
have O
been O
classified O
into O
community-acquired O
and O
nosocomial O
infections O
according O
to O
the O
route O
of O
infection. O
As O
the O
healthcare-associated O
effects O
on O
community-onset O
infections O
cannot O
be O
overlooked, O
these O
infections O
have O
been O
divided O
into O
community-onset O
healthcare-associated O
(HCA) O
infections O
for O
patients O
with O
a O
recent O
history O
of O
medical O
care, O
and O
community-acquired O
infections O
for O
patients O
without O
[ O
2 O
]. O
Previous O
studies O
have O
described O
that O
HCA O
infections O
are O
different O
from O
CA O
infections O
and O
share O
some O
similarities O
with O
nosocomial O
infections O
regarding O
clinical O
characteristics, O
outcome O
and O
microbiological O
features O
[ O
2 O
, O

]. O
Although O
there O
have O
been O
studies O
on O
HCA O
infections, O
the O
data O
about O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
and O
molecular O
features O
of O
HCA O
K. O
pneumoniae O
infections O
are O
limited O
[ O
4 O
, O
5 O
]. O
Inadequate O
understanding O
of O
these O
infections O
could O
lead O
to O
inappropriate O
empirical O
treatment O
and, O
in O
consequence, O
higher O
morbidity O
and O
mortality. O
Antimicrobial O
resistance O
in O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
is O
a O
significant O
concern O
to O
public O
health. O
The O
CRKP O
and O
ESBL-positive O
K. O
pneumoniae O
strains O
are O
the O
most O
important O
and O
challenging O
drug-resistant O
bacteria, O
leading O
to O
limited O
treatment O
options O
and O
high O
mortality O
[ O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
Thus, O
understanding O
the O
distribution O
of O
such O
highly O
resistant O
strains O
in O
both O
hospitals O
and O
communities O
is O
vital O
to O
planning O
interventions. O

which O
reflects O
the O

Indeed, O
the O
use O
of O

to O
increase O

is O
quite O
common O
in O
Asia, O
although O

In O
this O

generally O
described O
as O
restorative, O

“tonics,” O
giving O
strength O
to O
the O

invigorating O
men O
at O

Ardisia O

Kaempferia O
parviflora O
(underground O
parts) O
which O
are O

on O
a O
large O

are O
highly O
prized. O
Indeed, O
recently O
K. O
parviflora, O
so-called O
black O
ginger, O
gained O
much O
popularity O
and O
has O
been O
formulated O
in O
many O

aiming O
to O
increase O
physical O
and O

Boesenbergia O
rotunda O
(Chinese O
ginger O
or O

is O
a O
culinary O
spice O
recently O
studied O
for O
its O
aphrodisiac O
properties O
[ O
63 O
– O
66 O
]. O
Aphrodisiac O
power O
is O
generally O
ascribed O
to O
roots O
(or O
underground O
parts O
of O
plants) O
macerated O
in O

In O
a O
few O

The O
morbid O
conditions O
related O
to O
obesity O
such O
as O
abdominal O
obesity, O
insulin O
resistance O
and O
glucose O
intolerance, O
hypertension O
and O
dyslipidemia O
are O
together O
called O
the O
metabolic O
syndrome. O
Obesity O
and O
its O
co‐associated O
morbidities, O
namely O
cardiovascular O
disease O
(CVD), O
type‐2 O
diabetes O
mellitus O
(T2DM), O
fatty O
liver O
disease O
and O
hypertension O
are O
a O
great O
economic O
burden O
in O
affected O
countries. O
Of O
note, O
accumulating O
evidence O
suggests O
a O
mechanistic O
relation O
between O
the O
cholesterol O
metabolism O
in O
the O
brain O
and O
the O
formation O
of O
Aβ O
plaques O
in O
AD O
development O
(Martins O
et O

2006 O
). O
High O

can O
place O
you O
at O
a O
higher O
risk O
for O
AD O
and O

Metabolomics O
study O
by O
Dumas O
et O
al O
suggested O
that O
gut O
microbiota O
may O
also O
play O
an O
active O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O
complex O
metabolic O
abnormalities, O
such O
as O
susceptibility O
to O
insulin O
resistance O
and O
fatty O
liver O
disease O
(Dumas O
et O
al., O
2006 O
). O
Subsequent O
analysis O
of O
germ-free O
versus O
conventional O
mice O
on O
high-fat O
diet O
revealed O
that O
both O
insulin O
sensitivity O
and O
cholesterol O
metabolism O
are O
metabolic O
targets O
influenced O
by O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
(Rabot O
et O
al., O
2010 O
). O
Complementary O
clinical O
studies O
further O
demonstrated O
that O
raised O
circulating O
levels O
of O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
metabolite O
within O
subjects O
predicted O
increased O
cardiovascular O
danger O
independent O
of O
traditional O
cardiovascular O
risk O
factors O
(Wang O
et O

). O
Increasingly, O
the O
role O
of O
CVD O
is O
also O
being O
recognized O
as O
an O
important O
etiologic O
hallmark O
of O
AD. O
Indeed, O
many O
studies O
were O
summarized O
findings O
on O
CVD O
and O
risk O
factors O
in O
the O
aetiology O
of O
AD O
and O
showed O
the O
importance O
of O
vascular O
pathology O
in O
AD O
(Jagust, O
2001 O
; O
de O
la O
Torre, O
2004 O
; O
de O
Bruijn O
and O
Ikram, O
2014 O
). O
Consequently, O
there O
is O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
proofs O
suggesting O
that O
gut O
microbiota, O
through O
a O
variety O
of O
processes, O
can O
influence O
physiological O
processes O
important O
for O
the O
development O
of O

(Hazen O

Therefore, O
when O
selecting O
suitable O

to O
employ O
and O
device O
for O
plant O
sample O
analysis, O

source O
and O

Conclusion O
and O

The O
influence O
of O
stress O
and O
defense O
responses O
to O
plant O
physiology O
associated O
with O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
PSMs O
is O
multi-faceted, O
and O
increasing O
evidences O
from O
recent O
literature O
reports O
suggest O
the O
crucial O
role O
played O
by O
stress O
signal O
transduction O
system O
in O
their O
production. O
Ample O
number O
of O
the O
studies O
(e.g. O
Tables O
1 O
and O
2 O
) O
have O
shown O
that O
both O
stress O
and O
defense O
responses O
are O
involved O
in O
SM O
in O
plants, O
although O
stress O
is O
the O
most O
investigated O
and O
understood. O
Because O
the O
responses O
are O
induced O
at O
subcellular O
level, O
their O
study O
is O
challenging. O
Thus, O
the O
use O
of O
biochemical O
and O
metabolic O
markers O
remains O
the O
most O
employed O
approach O
in O
drawing O
inferences O
on O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
stress O
and O
defense O
response O
to O

in O
the O

of O
plants O
in O
most O
of O
the O
reported O
studies O
using O
tissue O
or O
organs O
evaluated, O
rarely O
with O
whole O
plant O
system O
or O
cellular O
levels. O
During O
both O
responses, O
specific O
and O
non-specific O
reactions O
that O
permit O
adjustment O
of O
resource O
utilization O
by O
the O
plants O
from O
primary O
metabolism O
(Fig. O
1 O
) O
may O
occur, O
with O
possible O
impact O
on O
biomass O
and O
SMs O
production. O
The O
responses O
are O
dependent O
on O
the O
metabolic O
capacity O
of O
the O
studied O
plant O
determined O
by O
the O
genetic O
background, O
depending O
on O
the O
genus, O
species, O
genotype, O
and O
cultivar O
investigated, O
environmental O
factors O
and O
developmental O

The O

Third O
, O
and O
unlike O
most O
of O
the O
Viridiplantae O
groups, O
CLO/PXG-like O
sequences O
are O
absent O
from O
a O
large O
proportion O
(about O
70%) O
of O
currently O
sequenced O
fungal O
genomes. O
In O
a O
few O
cases, O
such O
as O
the O
Orbiliomycetes O
and O
Lecanoromycetes, O
current O
information O
indicates O
that O
the O
genes O
are O
absent O
from O
an O
entire O
class O
of O
fungi. O
However, O
in O
these O
classes O
only O
a O
few O
species O
have O
so O
far O
been O
sequenced O
so O
it O
might O
be O
the O
case O
that O
CLO/PXG-like O
genes O
are O
in O
fact O
present O
in O
some O
members O
of O
all O
fungal O
classes. O
In O
many O
other O
cases, O
such O
as O
in O
the O
important O
genera, O
Aspergillus, O
Penicillium O
and O
Colletotrichum, O
the O
genes O
are O
present O
in O
one O
or O
more O
members O
of O
each O
genus O
but O
are O
absent O
from O
close O
relatives O
in O
the O
same O
genus. O
These O
findings O
imply O
that O
in O
the O
Fungi O
as O
a O
whole O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
were O
probably O
originally O
present O
in O
all O
of O
the O
early O
diverging O
taxa O
but O
they O
have O
frequently O
been O
lost O
during O
subsequent O
evolution, O
albeit O
being O
retained O
in O
almost O
one O
third O
of O
fungal O
species. O
In O
terms O
of O
their O
subcellular O
orientation, O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
were O
predicted O
to O
have O
an O
‘extracellular’ O
facing O
N-terminal O
domain O
containing O
the O
Ca O
2+ O
binding O
EF O
hand O
motif O
(Additional O
file O
18 O
: O
Figure O
S3C). O
In O
proteins O
with O
a O
single O
TM O
domain O
this O
means O
that O
they O
would O
have O
a O
large O
cytoplasmic O
domain O
containing O
several O
highly O
conserved O
regions O
including O
kinase O
sites O
while O
in O
proteins O
with O
two O
TM O
domains O
there O
is O
a O
smaller O
cytoplasmic O
domain O
and O
two O
‘extracellular’ O
facing O
domains O
(Additional O
file O
19 O
: O
Figure O
S3D). O
In O
terms O
of O
ER-binding O
proteins O
the O
‘extracellular’ O
domain O
is O
equivalent O
to O
the O
lumen O
compartment O
while O
for O
plasmalemma O
proteins O
it O
really O
is O
extracellular. O
Therefore O
the O
Ca O
2+ O
binding O
and O
heme-coordinating O
regions O
of O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
proteins O
are O
probably O
located O
either O
in O
the O
ER O
lumen O
or O
outside O
the O
cell O
membrane O
while O
there O
are O
several O
kinase O
sites O
on O
the O
cytoplasmic O
portions O
of O
these O
proteins. O

36 O
prompted O
us O
to O
examine O
the O
expression O
of O
REGγ O
in O
experimental O
colitis O
tissues; O
a O
significantly O
higher O
level O
of O
REGγ O
was O
detected O
in O
colitis O
lesions O
than O
in O
normal O
controls O
( O
Supplementary O
Fig. O

). O
Expression O
of O
REGγ O
mRNA O
was O
also O
increased O
after O
DSS O
induction O
( O
Supplementary O
Fig. O
5C O
). O
We O
next O
addressed O
the O
correlation O
between O
REGγ O
expression O
and O
human O
IBDs. O
We O
carried O
out O
bioinformatics O
analysis O
of O
previously O
collected O
microarray O
data O
sets O
(ID:GSE10616) O
by O
statistical O
approaches O
as O
described O
in O
methods. O
The O
results O
indicate O
that O
REGγ O
RNA O
levels O
are O
significantly O
higher O
in O
UC O
specimens O
compared O
with O
healthy O
and O
CD O
controls O
( O
Fig. O
7a O
). O
Moreover, O
we O
evaluated O
the O
correlation O
between O
REGγ O
expression O
and O
UC O
status O
by O
immunohistochemistry O
(IHC) O
analysis O
of O
74 O
human O
colon O
tissues/lesions. O
The O
expression O
of O
REGγ O
in O
three O
groups O
of O
specimens O
was O
scored O
double-blindly O
and O
statistically O
analysed O
as O
described O
36 O
. O
We O
detected O
significantly O
higher O
expression O
of O
REGγ O
in O
severe O
colitis O
cases O
( O
Fig. O
7b,c O
) O
with O
an O
IgG O
control O
( O
Fig. O
7d O
), O
suggesting O
a O
positive O
correlation O
between O
REGγ O
and O
UC O
inflammatory O
lesions. O
However, O
expression O
of O
IkBɛ O
in O
these O
severe O
cases O
had O
significant O
reduction O
( O
Fig. O
7b,c O
), O
reflecting O
a O
negative O
relation O
between O
REGγ O
and O
IκBɛ O
in O
UC. O
Thus, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
higher O
expression O
of O
REGγ O
is O
correlated O
with O
colitis, O
implicating O
an O
important O
role O
of O
REGγ O
in O
the O
development O
of O
colitis, O
for O
which O
REGγ O
may O
potentially O
serve O
as O
a O
maker. O

In O
contrast, O
Rv1667c O
is O
also O
induced O
upon O
exposure O
to O
first-line O
antibiotics O
(Zhang O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
Boot O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
Furthermore, O
it O
can O
also O
be O
speculated O
that O
increased O
expression O
of O
cyp139a1 O
(or O
one O
of O
the O
other O
CYPs) O
contributes O
to O
the O
intrinsic O
resistance O
of O
Mtb O
to O
anti-TB O
agents. O
Cyp143a1 O
and O
its O
tentative O
associated O
cognate O
redox O
partner, O
Rv1786 O
(FdxE), O
were O
upregulated O
after O
exposure O
to O
these O
antibiotics O
(Fig. O
3 O
) O
(Boot O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
Furthermore, O
the O
expression O
of O
Rv1790, O
encoding O
PPE27, O
was O
also O
upregulated O
whereas O
other O
genes O
in O
the O
ESX-5 O
cluster O
were O
downregulated O
or O
relatively O
unaffected O
(Boot O
et O
al. O
2018 O
). O
In O
addition, O
FdxA O
was O
also O
induced O
by O
exposure O
to O
anti-TB O
compounds, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
protein O
is O
a O
key O
player O
in O
pathways O
to O
resist O
insults O
Mtb O
may O
encounter O
in O

(Fischer O

Namouchi O

2016 O
; O
Boot O

). O
The O
same O
holds O
true O
for O
FdxB, O
after O
exposure O
to O
all O
four O
antibiotics O
(Fig. O

a, O

The O
cluster O
with O
the O
strongest O
downregulation O
of O
transcription O
consisted O
of O
cyp135a1, O
cyp130a1, O
cyp123a1, O
and O
cyp125a1 O
together O
with O
the O
electron O

FdxC O
and O
FdxD. O
A O
plausible O
explanation O
could O
be O
that O
these O
proteins O
are O
constitutively O
highly O
expressed O
(Ricagno O
et O
al. O
2007 O
). O
CYP125A1 O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
Mtb O
growth O
in O
cholesterol. O
Its O
downregulation O
under O
antibiotic O
exposure O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
capability O
of O
the O
bacteria O
to O
distinguish O
different O

Discussion O
As O
a O
main O
nitrogen O
source, O
ammonium O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
plant O
growth O
and O
development. O
Knowledge O
about O
ammonium O
uptake O
and O
translocation O
has O
been O
obtained O
by O
extensive O
investigations O
on O
ammonium O
transporters O
in O
Arabidopsis O
and O
rice. O
However, O
the O
physiological O
roles O
of O
AMTs O
in O
the O
interaction O
between O
plants O
and O
environmental O
microbes O
remain O
largely O
unknown. O
Although O
two O
types O
of O
AMTs O
share O
common O
secondary O
protein O
structures O
and O
biochemical O
activities, O
AMT2-type O
AMTs O
showed O
apparent O
difference O
in O
amino O
acid O
sequences, O
especially O
in O
those O
regions O
related O
to O
transport O
activity O
regulation. O

It O
was O
hypothesized O
that O
CYP128A1 O
catalyzes O
the O
required O
hydroxylation O
of O
dihydromenaquinone O
(MK-9 O
DH2), O
which O
is O
further O
sulfonated O
by O
a O
sulfotransferase O
(Sft3 O
encoded O
by O
Rv2267c) O
yielding O
S881 O
(Fig. O
1 O
) O
(Cole O
et O
al. O
1998 O
; O
Holsclaw O
et O
al. O
2008 O
). O
S881 O
is O
a O
sulfolipid O
(SL-1) O
located O
in O
the O
outer O
membrane O
cell O
wall, O
where O
it O
acts O
as O
negative O
regulator O
of O
virulence O
(Mougous O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
ten O
Bokum O
et O
al. O
2008 O
; O
Jackson O
2014 O
). O
Hence, O
assuming O
that O
CYP128A1 O
is O
indeed O
a O
quinol O
hydroxylase, O
it O
is O
an O
unlikely O
therapeutic O
target O
for O
Mtb. O
CYP130A1: O
an O
orphan O
enzyme O
Cyp130a1, O
as O
well O
as O
cyp141a1, O
are O
not O
required O
for O
Mtb O
growth O
in O
vitro. O
Furthermore, O
these O
genes O
are O
absent O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
species O
Mycobacterium O
bovis, O
suggesting O
that, O
if O
they O
play O
a O
role O
in O
virulence, O
this O
must O
be O
specific O
for O
Mtb. O
Cyp130a1 O
is O
located O
alongside O
the O
same O
functional O
operon O
as O
Rv1258c, O
a O
gene O
encoding O
a O
putative O
tetracycline/aminoglycoside O
resistance O
(TAP)2-like O
efflux O
pump, O
which O
is O
upregulated O
treatment O
with O
tetracycline, O
streptomycin, O
erythromycin, O
and O
rifampicin O
(unlike O
cyp130a1, O
as O
discussed O
in O
section O
5) O
and O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
efflux-mediated O
resistance O
in O
MDR-TB O
(Siddiqi O

; O
Burian O
et O

2012 O
; O

). O
Yet, O
no O
direct O
functional O
association O
has O
been O
reported O
between O
cyp130a1 O
and O
Rv1258c. O

Some O
microbes O
can O
remain O
latent O
in O
the O
body O
with O
the O
potential O
for O
reactivation, O
the O
effects O
of O
which O
might O
happen O
years O
after O
early O
infection; O
and O
that O
people O
can O
be O
infected O
but O
not O
necessarily O
affected, O
such O
that O
‘controls’, O
even O
if O
infected, O
but O
with O
symptoms O
(Itzhaki, O
2014 O
). O
It O
is O
remarkable O
that O
human O
microorganisms O
that O
produce O
amyloids O
such O
as O
CsgA, O
Aβ42, O
and O
other O
peptides O
that O
accrue O
in O
AD O
brains O
(Hill O
and O
Lukiw, O
2015 O
). O
For O
example, O
amyloids O
are O
related O
to O
fungal O
surface-structures O
and O
the O
new O
statement O
of O
amyloidogenic O
fungal O
proteins O
and O
diffuse O
mycoses O
in O
the O
blood O
of O
AD O
patients O
suggest O
that O
chronic O
fungal O
infection O
associates O
with O
high O
risk O
of O
AD O
(Hill O
et O
al., O
2014 O
). O
Moreover, O
Escherichia O
coli O
produce O
extracellular O
amyloids O
known O
as O
curli O
fibers, O
composed O
of O
the O
major O
structural O
sub-unit O
CsgA, O
are O
a O
common O
secretory O
component O
that O
facilitate O
surface O
adhesion, O
biofilm O
development O
and O
protection O
against O
host O
defences O
(Schwartz O
and O
Boles, O
2013 O
). O
A O
number O
of O
bacterial O
amyloid O
systems O
include O
Pseudomonas, O
Streptomyces, O
Staphylococcus, O
Bacillus, O
and O
others, O
propose O
that O
functional O
amyloids O
are O
an O
extensive O
phenomenon O
used O
by O
a O
wide O
diversity O
of O
microbiomes O
(Schwartz O
and O
Boles, O
2013 O
; O
Hill O
et O
al., O
2014 O
). O
Furthermore, O
bacterial O
enzymes O
may O
also O
produce O
neurotoxic O
metabolites O
such O
as O
D-lactic O
acid O
and O
ammonia O
(Galland, O
2014 O
). O
The O
direct O

between O
the O

For O

In O

Thus, O

be O
an O

For O

the O

these O

In O

only O
89 O

were O

This O
is O
not O
because O
there O

rather O
that O
they O
are O

which O

The O

Of O

only O
15 O

As O
discussed O

some O

For O

we O

In O

These O

contrast O
sharply O
with O
our O

of O

sequences O
from O
plants O
where O
all O
of O

two O

and O
the O
majority O
contained O
between O
five O
and O
six O
introns O
[ O

]. O
While O
intronless O
genes O
are O
frequently O
found O
in O
single-celled O
eukaryotes O
they O
are O
much O
less O
common O
in O
multicellular O
plants O
animals O
and O

Hence, O
in O
the O
Metazoa, O
between O
3 O
and O
17% O
of O
genes O
are O
intronless O
in O
deuterostomes O
(including O
3% O

In O

In O
the O

Discussion O
The O
experimental O
approach O
described O
in O
this O
study O
provides O
a O
novel O
perspective O
on O
the O
lettuce/Rhizoctonia O
pathosystem. O
Through O
sampling O
of O
lettuce O
leaf O
tissue O
at O
different O
distances O
from O
the O
R. O
solani O
AG1-IB O
inoculation O
site O
as O
the O
defining O
variable, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
distinguish O
three O
phases O
defined O
by O
their O
transcriptional O
patterns O
as O
response O
to O
interacting O
R. O
solani O
hyphae. O
Hereby, O
the O
natural O
situation O
involving O
neighbouring O
tissues O
at O
different O
levels O
of O
interaction O
at O
the O
same O
time-point O
were O
analyzed O
at O
the O
transcriptional O
level. O
Regarding O
the O
systemic O
response, O
we O
assumed O
that O
the O
different O
interaction O
zones O
cannot O
be O
differentiated, O
whereas O
intensity O
of O
the O
local O
interaction O
increases O
by O
decreasing O
proximity O
to O
the O
inoculation O
site. O
The O
large O
numbers O
of O
detected O
DEGs O
as O
well O
as O
the O
observed O
metabolome O
composition O
shifts O
verified O
the O
relevance O
of O
the O
selected O
zones O
since O
they O
represent O
distinguishable O
interaction O
phases. O
The O
magnitude O
of O
both, O
the O
transcriptomic O
as O
well O
as O
the O
metabolomic O
changes O
is O
another O
statement O
to O
the O
complexity O
of O
plant-host/pathogen O
interactions. O
Furthermore, O
our O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
in O
the O
transition O
from O
zone O
2 O
to O
3 O
only O
relatively O
few O
transcriptional O
changes O
were O
observed. O
This O
correlates O
with O
previous O
findings O
regarding O
the O
R. O
solani O
transcriptional O
response O
in O
the O
same O
experimental O
setting O
12 O
. O
There, O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
most O
if O
not O
all O
lettuce O
tissue O
is O
diseased O
in O
zone O
3 O
12 O
. O
Retrospectively, O
more O
than O
500 O
DEGs O
were O
found O
to O
be O
up-regulated O
in O
R. O
solani O
between O
zone O
2 O
and O
3. O
Concerning O
the O
lettuce O
transcriptional O
response, O
we O
mainly O
focused O
on O
the O
interaction O
zones O
1 O
and O
2. O
Reduced O
transcription O
of O
pentatricopeptide O
genes O
in O
zone O
1 O
and O
2 O
Among O
the O
identified O
DEGs, O
pentatricopeptide O
(PPR) O
genes O
are O
generally O
down-regulated O
in O
interaction O
zones O
1 O
and O
2, O
but O
most O
prominently O
in O
zone O
2. O

In O
the O
later O
time-point O
of O
the O
latter O
study O
(GSE57950 O
drought O

plants O
down-regulated O
photosynthesis-annotated O
genes, O
suggesting O
there O
may O
be O
some O
temporal O
effects O
of O
drought O
on O
altered O
regulation O
of O
photosynthesis, O
particularly O
as O
leaves O
dehydrate O
after O
continued O
drought. O
In O

GSE108504, O
rice O

A O
recent O
study O

showed O
an O
increased O
mucociliary O
clearance O
in O
upper O
and O
lower O
airways O
of O
guinea O
pig O
in O
vivo O
and O
in O
human O
nasal O
cell O
cultures O
in O
response O
to O
denatonium, O
saccharin O
or O
chloroquine. O
This O
study O
provides O
an O
interesting O
pre-clinical O
model O
useful O
for O
the O
study O
of O
different O
upper O
and O
lower O
respiratory O
diseases O
and O
for O
the O
evaluation O
of O
new O
therapies O
to O
improve O
mucociliary O
clearance. O
The O
responses O
to O
bitter O
tastants O
and O
artificial O
sweeteners O
and O
the O
expression O
of O
T2Rs O
and O
T1Rs O
in O
the O
airways O
indicate O
that O
these O
receptors O
may O
be O
potential O
drug O
targets. O
Indeed, O
several O
studies O
have O
suggested O
a O
drug O
target O
role O
for O
human O
bitter O
receptors O
expressed O
in O
airways. O
For O
example, O
activation O
of O
T2R O
receptors O
in O
smooth O
muscle O
cells O
of O
the O
airway O
causes O
bronchodilation O
and O
it O
was O
therefore O
hypothesized O
that O
agonists O
for O
these O
receptors O
might O
represent O
a O
new O
class O
of O
bronchodilators O
drugs O
that O
are O
under O
investigation O
for O
asthma O
and O
airways O
obstructive O
pathology O
71 O
– O
74 O
. O
It O
is O
likely O
that O
these O
tastants O
act O
through O
their O
receptors O
to O
activate O
protective O
signaling O
responses O
in O
the O
airways. O
This O
might O
be O
potentially O
intriguing O
for O
respiratory O
infections O
in O
particular O
for O
clinical O
conditions O
at O
risk O
of O
developing O
airways O
infections O
(e.g. O
mechanical O
ventilated O
patients, O
immunodeficiency O
syndromes, O
diabetes) O
because O
epithelial O
cells O
receptors O
of O
the O
airways O
could O
be O
considered O
a O
potential O
target O
for O
novel O
drugs O
aimed O
to O
regulate O
the O
glucose O
level O
in O
the O
airways. O
Moreover, O
it O
is O
also O
important O
to O
mention O
that O
genetic O
variations O
of O
bitter O
or O
sweet O
receptor O
genes O
could O
modify O
the O
responses O
to O
bitter O
or O
sweet O
substances O
75 O
– O
77 O
. O
In O
the O
same O
way, O
this O
genetic O
variability O
might O
play O
a O
role O
in O
susceptibility O
to O
respiratory O
infections O
78 O
. O
This O
idea O
might O
partially O
explain O
the O
old O
evidence O
that O
there O
is O
a O
genetic O
basis O
to O
respiratory O
infections O
79 O
, O
80 O
. O
Thus, O
also O
genetic O
variability O
features O
of O
sweet O
receptors O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
for O
future O
drug O
research O
in O
airway O
diseases. O

However, O
unlike O
lowland O
healers, O
Hmong O
do O
not O
use O
a O
technique O
of O
preparing O
remedies O
called O
fon O
yaa, O
which O
consists O
in O
rubbing O
the O
hard O
ingredients O
of O
the O
remedies O
(stem, O
bark, O
root, O
shell, O
horn, O
etc.) O
on O
a O
special O
stone O
in O
a O
back O
and O
forth O
movement, O
and O
mixing O
the O
particles O
deposited O
with O
some O
water O
that O
will O
be O
drunk O
by O
the O
patient. O
This O
technique O
is O
characteristic O
of O
southern O
Laos, O
and O
it O
is O
clearly O
linked O
to O
ancient O
Khmer O
influence O
(Vidal O
1958), O
and O
is O
therefore O
not O
integrated O
into O
Hmong O
practices. O
Finally, O
another O
difference O
that O
has O
been O
noted O
in O
the O
use O
of O
this O
pharmacopeia O
concerns O
the O
way O
in O
which O
postpartum O
is O
treated, O
even O
if O
some O
postpartum O
plants O
might O
be O
similar O
to O
both O
groups. O
Significant O
differences O
between O
the O
Hmong O
and O
lowland O
Lao O
traditional O
medicines O
can O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
aspects O
of O
gender, O
transmission O
methods, O
and O
renumeration. O
Lowland O
Lao O
medicine, O
strongly O
influenced O
by O
Theravada O
Buddhist O
tradition, O
is O
usually O
practised O
by O
men O
and O
transmitted O
through O
the O
male O
line; O
however, O
as O
for O
the O
Hmong, O
this O
may O
be O
variable. O
While O
Hmong O
medicine O
is O
passed O
down O
orally, O
lowland O
Lao O
medical O
knowledge O
may O
include O
a O
combination O
of O
manuscripts, O
written O
prescriptions, O
and O
oral O
transmission O
[ O
11 O
]. O
Unlike O
the O
Hmong, O
lowland O
Lao O
healers O
do O
not O
traditionally O
accept O
payment O
for O
treatments, O
believing O
it O
to O
prevent O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
medicine, O
and O
so O
renumeration O
is O
at O
the O
discretion O
of O
the O
patients, O
as O
an O
“offering,” O
and O
medical O
consultations O
usually O
take O
place O
in O
their O
houses O
in O
a O
village, O
although O
there O
are O
also O
“medicine O
sellers.” O
Thus, O
the O
Hmong O
have O
a O
greater O
financial O
imperative O
to O
keep O
their O
knowledge O
secret, O
within O
their O
lineage. O
In O
contrast, O
for O
the O
Lao O
healers, O
there O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
greater O
sharing O
and O
homogeneity O
in O
knowledge O
[ O
12 O
], O
although O
the O
more O
esoteric O
practices O
are O
not O
revealed O
to O
others O
and O
specific O
recipes O
are O
usually O
kept O
secret. O
Finally, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
underline O
the O
dynamic O
and O
evolving O
nature O
of O
the O
Hmong O
pharmacopeia O
and O
its O
uses. O

However, O
some O

Both O

(the O

After O
24 O

G418 O
with O
the O
best O

concentration O
was O
added O
for O
the O

Briefly, O
upon O

of O
a O
large O

after O
6 O
days O

the O

After O

Our O

a O
profound O
down-regulation O

both O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
expression O
of O
cathepsin O
B, O

S, O

It O
is O
well O

that O
poxviruses O

a O
global O
shutdown O

host O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
synthesis O
probably O
to O
facilitate O
their O

and O
restriction O
of O
competition O
for O
the O
translational O
machinery O
[ O
40 O
– O
42 O
]. O
This O
phenomenon O
would O
explain O
why O
both O
cathepsins O
and O
their O
negative O
regulator O
cystatins O
are O
downregulated O
in O
ECTV-infected O
cDCs. O
Interestingly, O
we O
observed O
that O
the O
mRNA O
expression O
for O
cathepsin O
B, O
S O
and O
cystatin O
C O
was O
primarily O
reduced O
in O
JAWS O

cells. O
Moreover, O
we O
observed O
profound O
down-regulation O
of O
gene O
expression O
for O
cathepsin O
B, O
S O
and O
cystatin O
B O
in O
GM-BM O
cells. O
The O
level O
of O
cathepsin O
L O
and O
S O
protein O
was O
greatly O
reduced O
in O
JAWS O
II O
cells, O
while O
cathepsin O
S O
and O
cystatin O
C O
protein O
expression O
was O
primarily O
reduced O
in O
GM-BM O
cells. O
These O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
our O
previous O
findings O
that O
ECTV O
infection O
of O
peritoneal O
macrophages O
isolated O
from O
ECTV-infected O
susceptible O
BALB/c O
and O

C57BL/6 O

have O
decreased O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
level O
of O
cathepsins O
B, O
L O
and O
S O
[ O
24 O
]. O
We O
were O
unable O
to O
detect O
expression O
of O
cystatin O
A O
in O
cDCs, O
however, O
according O
to O
Kopitar-Jerala O
[ O

] O
cystatin O
A O
is O
present O
only O
in O
the O
follicular O

(FDCs) O
that O
do O
not O

and O

A O
high O
value O
of O
GF O
mice O
in O
microbiome O
research O
is O
their O
utility O
in O
generating O
purely O
human O
microbiota-associated O
mouse O
models O
for O
studying O
microbe-host O
interactions O
and O
demonstrating O
causal O
effects O
of O
the O
microbiota O
on O
the O
health/disease O
states O
of O
the O
host. O
Indeed, O
successful O
transfer O
of O
microbiota O
from O
humans O
to O
GF O
mice O
often O
imprints O
the O
human O
health O
phenotype O
onto O
the O
murine O
recipient. O
There O
are O
some O
differences O
between O
mice O
and O
humans O
which O
might O
affect O
the O
efficiency O
of O
human O
gut O
microbiota O
engraftment O
into O
mice O
or O
their O
spatial O
establishment O
throughout O
the O
GI O
tract. O
A O
potentially O
relevant O
difference O
in O
GI O
tract O
anatomy O
is O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
non-glandular O
fore-stomach O
in O
mice, O
which O
takes O
up O
two O
thirds O
of O
the O
stomach, O
has O
no O
secretory O
activity, O
and O
serves O
for O
temporary O
food O
storage. O
This O
allows O
for O
food O
to O
be O
ingested O
in O
bulk, O
but O
to O
be O
released O
for O
downstream O
digestion O
more O
gradually O
according O
to O
energy O
demands. O
The O
lack O
of O
gastric O
secretions O
in O
the O
fore-stomach O
results O
in O
higher O
pH O
of O
its O
contents O
(pH O
4.8) O
[ O
73 O
] O
and O
the O
overall O
pH O
in O
the O
mouse O
stomach O
is O
2.7–4.1, O
while O
in O
humans O
it O
can O
be O
as O
low O
as O
pH O
1 O
[ O
71 O
]. O
The O
milder O
pH O
and O
the O
abundance O
of O
oligosaccharides O
in O
the O
mouse O
fore-stomach O
provide O
conditions O
for O
the O
bloom O
of O
Lactobacillae, O
whereas O
in O
humans, O
the O
stomach O
contains O
mainly O
Streptococcus, O
Prevotella O
spp. O
and O
Helicobacter O
pylori O
[ O
71 O
, O
73 O
]. O
Another O
difference O
is O
the O
presence O
of O
circular O
folds O
(plicae O
circularis) O
in O
the O
human O
small O
intestinal O
mucosa, O
which O
are O
absent O
in O
mice O
[ O
71 O
, O
74 O
]. O
These O
structures O
could O
provide O
additional O
niche O
for O
mucus-associated O
bacteria O
[ O
71 O
]. O
Mice O
also O
have O

Background O
The O
human O
body O
is O
a O
complex O
ecosystem O
inhabited O
and O
influenced O
by O
an O
abundance O
of O
microorganisms O
including O
bacteria, O
yeast, O
fungi, O
protozoa, O
archaea, O
and O
viruses, O
all O
of O
which O
collectively O
constitute O
the O
commensal O
microbiota. O
The O
commensal O
microbiota O
and O
the O
human O
host O
have O
co-evolved O
in O
a O
mutualistic O
relationship, O
in O
which O
each O
benefits O
the O
fitness O
of O
the O
other O
and O
the O
two O
can O
be O
collectively O
viewed O
as O
a O
superorganism. O
Much O
recent O
research O
has O
focused O
on O
the O
bacterial O
component O
of O
the O
microbiota. O
On O
average, O
a O
healthy O
human O
body O
is O
comprised O
of O
approximately O
30 O
trillion O
cells O
and O
is O
inhabited O
by O
approximately O
39 O
trillion O
bacterial O
cells O
[ O
1 O
]. O
The O
collection O
of O
genes O
within O
the O
commensal O
microbiota O
is O
defined O
as O
the O
commensal O
microbiome O
and O
vastly O
outnumbers O
human O
genes. O
The O
microbiota O
is O
capable O
of O
synthesizing O
or O
transforming O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
metabolites, O
including O
hormones, O
essential O
vitamins, O
and O
other O
bioactive O
compounds, O
which O
cannot O
be O
otherwise O
acquired O
by O
the O
host O
[ O
2 O
]. O
These O
metabolites O
can O
modulate O
various O
biological O
functions, O
most O
notably O
the O
immune O
and O
nervous O
systems O
[ O
3 O
]. O
Alterations O
in O
the O
normal O
microbiota O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
development O
of O
many O
diseases O
[ O
4 O
– O
15 O
]. O
In O
the O
cancer O
context, O
some O
specific O
bacteria O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
process O
of O
carcinogenesis O
[ O
15 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
the O
microbiota O
has O
also O
been O
implicated O
in O
modulating O
the O
efficacy O
and O
toxicity O
of O
cancer O
therapy, O
including O
chemotherapy O
and O
immunotherapy O
[ O
16 O
]. O
Preclinical O
data O
suggest O
that O
modulation O
of O
the O
microbiota O
could O
become O
a O
novel O
strategy O
for O
improving O
the O
efficacy O
of O
immune-based O
therapies O
for O
cancer, O
in O
particular O
checkpoint O
blockade O
approaches O
targeting O
the O
CTLA-4 O
and O
PD-1 O
pathways O
[ O

Establishment O
of O

in O
the O

In O
adults O
the O

consists O
of O
about O
a O
dozen O
phyla, O
primarily O
Firmicutes O
and O
Bacteroidetes, O
followed O
by O
Actinobacteria, O
Proteobacteria, O
Fusobacteria, O
and O
others O
[ O

In O
the O
absence O
of O
antibiotics, O
resistant O
strains O
were O
at O
a O
disadvantage O
to O
sensitive O
strains. O
From O
this O
study, O
there O
was O
no O
direct O
relationship O
between O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
fitness O
cost O
of O
the O
mutation O
and O
the O
level O
of O
rifampin O
resistance. O
Except O
for O
H491D O
and O
485::TAA, O
most O
of O
the O
mutants O
had O
no O
obvious O
damage O
to O
growth O
performance O
in O
vitro. O
Studies O
in O
Neisseria O
meningitidis O
indicated O
that O
the O
growth O
of O
mutation O
S487F O
at O
37 O
°C O
was O
significantly O
inhibited O
and O
had O
a O
high O
fitness O
cost O
[ O
12 O
], O
but O
the O
same O
mutation O
in O
R. O
anatipestifer O
was O
more O
normal. O
As O
with O
the O
study O
in O
M. O
tuberculosis, O
the O
fitness O
costs O
of O
different O
rpoB O
mutations O
were O
different, O
and O
the O
relative O
fitness O
of O
the O
H491D O
mutant O
was O
always O
the O
lowest O
of O
all O
mutation O
types O
at O
this O
site O
(equivalent O
to O
H526D O
in O
this O
study) O
[ O
32 O
]. O
However, O
colonization O
experiments O
in O
ducklings O
showed O
that O
whether O
R494K, O
whose O
in O
vitro O
growth O
and O
competitive O
ability O
were O
similar O
to O
the O
parental O
strain, O
or O
H491D, O
whose O
growth O
and O
competition O
abilities O
decreased, O
both O
of O
their O
colonization O
abilities O
were O
deduced O
in O
vivo. O
This O
suggests O
that O
all O
of O
the O
rpoB O
mutants O
in O
the O
ATCC O
11845 O
background O
in O
the O
natural O
environment O
might O
be O
at O
a O
disadvantage. O
In O
fact, O
the O
colonization O
abilities O
of O
ATCC O
11845 O
and O
isolates O
were O
confirmed, O
which O
again O
suggested O
that O
both O
the O
background O
of O
the O
strains O
and O
the O
rpoB O
mutation O
could O
have O
a O
significant O
impact O
on O
the O
resistance O
and O
pathogenicity. O
Among O
the O
spontaneous O
rpoB O
mutants O
from O
Acinetobacter O
baumannii O
ATCC O
17978, O
the O
mutants O
carrying O
substitutions O
at O
amino O
acids O
522 O
and O
540 O
all O
showed O
phenotypes O
of O
impaired O
movement O
and O
reduced O
virulence O
[ O
34 O
]. O
The O
transcriptome O
information O
of O
the O
mutants O
showed O
that O
the O
expression O
levels O
of O
the O
four O
coding O
transporters O
and O
metabolic O
enzymes O
in O
the O
mutants O
were O
directly O
related O
to O
the O
above O
phenotypes. O
The O
virulence O
genes O
of O
the O
mutant O
strain O
in O
this O
study O
were O
worth O
exploring O
at O
the O
transcription O
level. O

These O
results O
suggested O
that O
TaAMT2;3a O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
transporting O
ammonium O
in O
the O

and O
play O
an O

as O
demonstrated O
by O

placental O

may O
also O
alter O

The O
effects O

environmental O
exposures, O
such O
as O
alcohol, O
on O
function O

was O
discussed O
by O
Jacinta O
Kalisch-Smith O
(University O

and O
Diana O
Laird O
(University O
of O
California, O

extended O
this O
discussion O
to O
incorporate O
how O
environmental O
exposures O
might O
affect O
subsequent O
generations, O
possibly O
via O
epigenetic O
mechanisms. O
Elizabeth O
Duncan O
(University O
of O
Leeds, O
UK) O
discussed O
the O
role O
of O
epigenetic O
mechanisms O
in O
how O
insects, O
like O
the O
honeybee, O
are O
able O
to O
respond O
to O
environmental O
cues O
to O
produce O
two O
or O
more O
entirely O
different O
phenotypes O
from O
the O
same O
genotype, O
a O
phenomenon O
known O
as O
phenotypic O
plasticity. O
In O
insects, O
there O
are O
generally O
two O
extraembryonic O
membranes, O
the O
amnion O
and O
the O
serosa. O
Kristen O
Panfilio O
(University O
of O
Cologne, O
Germany; O
University O
of O
Warwick, O
UK) O
discussed O
what O
we O
know O
about O
the O
developmental O
origins O
of O
these O
tissues O
in O
insects O
and O
analogies O
with O
mammalian O
extraembryonic O
membranes. O
Kristen O
also O
delved O
into O
her O
work O
on O
the O
rupture O
of O
extraembryonic O
membranes O
(Hilbrant O
et O
al. O
2016 O
), O
a O
normal O
part O
of O
embryogenesis O
in O
insects, O
but O
a O
pathological O
process O
in O
mammals. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
key O
roles O
in O
morphogenesis, O
Maurijn O
van O
der O
Zee O
(Leiden O
University, O
the O
Netherlands) O
emphasised O
that O
the O
serosa O
protects O
the O
insect O
eggs O
against O
environmental O
exposures O
including O
pathogens O
and O
desiccation O
(Jacobs O
et O
al. O
2014 O
). O
This O
was O
reinforced O
by O
Nora O
Braak O
(Oxford O
Brookes O
University, O
UK), O
who O
showed O
that O
the O
serosa, O
although O
developing O
differently O
in O
butterflies, O
also O
has O
a O
role O
in O
embryonic O
immunity. O

The O

increased O
in O

only O

On O

in O
the O

an O

action O
of O
each O

(see O

was O

indicating O
that O
alteration O

cellular O
processes O
occurring O
in O
cells O
after O
exposure O
to O
CDM O
[ O

did O
not O
interfere O
with O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
refractory O
stage O
to O
HSV-2 O
infection O
in O
cells O
treated O

It O
is O
remarkable O
that O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
HSV-2 O
to O
CDM O
increased O
steadily O
in O
accordance O
with O
time O

Thus, O
after O

was O
2 O

reduced O
(Figure O

but O
if O

was O
extended O
to O

h, O
virus O

increased O
10 O
times O
(Figure O

In O

obtained O
with O
meliacine O
[ O

], O
addition O
of O

caused O
a O
strong O
inhibition O
of O
virus O
titer O
in O
the O
order O
of O
100 O
fold O
(Figure O

). O
Unexpectedly, O
when O
CDM O
was O
present O
for O
16 O
h O
before O
infection O
and O
for O
24 O
h O
afterwards, O
virus O
yield O
was O
reduced O
20.000 O
times O
(Figure O

). O
This O
high O
antiviral O
activity O
of O
CDM O
per O
se O
complicated O
the O
interpretation O
of O
the O
results O
obtained O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
IFN O
(Figure O

), O
which O
in O
comparison O
reduced O
the O
amount O
of O
virus O
even O
in O
combination O
less O
than O
2 O
logs. O
To O
overcome O
this O
inconvenience, O
we O
performed O
an O
experiment O
with O
lower O
concentrations O
of O
CDM O
added O
after O
virus O

and O
lasted O
to O

harvest, O
in O

A O

with O
IFN-α O
or O
CDM O
plus O
IFN-γ O
at O
all O
concentrations O
tested O
was O
observed O
(Figure O

). O
Thus, O
the O
results O
reported O
here O
indicated O
that O
the O
presence O
of O
CDM O
did O
not O
alter O
the O
biological O
activity O

or O

or O

Hence, O

CYP128A1: O
a O
possible O

Sassetti O
et O
al. O
initially O
identified O
cyp128a1 O
as O
essential O
for O
Mtb O
growth O
in O

Subsequent O
transposon O
mutagenesis O
studies O
did O
not O
validate O
this O
essentiality O
(Table O
1 O
). O
Several O
attempts O
to O
heterologously O
express O
CYP128A1 O
have O
been O
unsuccessful, O
preventing O
its O
biochemical O
and O
structural O
characterization. O
The O
operon O
containing O
cyp128a1 O
is O
comprised O
of O
three O
genes O
involved O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
a O
sulfated O
metabolite, O
S881, O
also O
known O
as O
sulfomenaquinone. O
It O
was O
hypothesized O
that O
CYP128A1 O
catalyzes O
the O
required O
hydroxylation O
of O
dihydromenaquinone O
(MK-9 O
DH2), O
which O
is O
further O
sulfonated O
by O
a O
sulfotransferase O
(Sft3 O
encoded O
by O
Rv2267c) O
yielding O
S881 O
(Fig. O
1 O
) O
(Cole O
et O
al. O
1998 O
; O
Holsclaw O
et O
al. O
2008 O
). O
S881 O
is O
a O
sulfolipid O
(SL-1) O
located O
in O
the O
outer O
membrane O
cell O
wall, O
where O
it O
acts O
as O

(Mougous O
et O

2006 O
; O
ten O
Bokum O
et O
al. O

; O

). O
Hence, O
assuming O
that O
CYP128A1 O
is O
indeed O
a O
quinol O
hydroxylase, O
it O
is O
an O
unlikely O
therapeutic O
target O
for O
Mtb. O
CYP130A1: O
an O

Cyp130a1, O
as O
well O
as O
cyp141a1, O
are O
not O
required O
for O
Mtb O
growth O
in O

Furthermore, O
these O
genes O
are O
absent O
in O
the O
closely O
related O
species O
Mycobacterium O
bovis, O
suggesting O
that, O
if O
they O
play O
a O
role O
in O
virulence, O
this O
must O
be O
specific O
for O
Mtb. O

Indeed, O
topical O

of O
a O

acutely O
reduced O

(Fig. O

Then, O
we O
performed O
intravital O
Ca O

imaging O

after O
topical O

We O
found O
that O

Finally, O

investigate O
the O
role O

the O

we O
crossed O

found O
that O

An O

in O
the O

First, O
the O

should O
be O
interpreted O
with O
caution: O
women O
suffering O
from O
UTIs O
without O
dysuria, O
frequent O
or O
urgent O
of O
urination O
were O
not O
included, O
which O
could O
decrease O
the O

had O
more O

which O
could O
influence O
the O

of O

especially O

the O

not O

preventing O
to O

and O
included O

on O
this O
point. O
However, O
in O
our O

there O
were O
more O

and O
less O
non-economically O

than O
in O
the O

This O
is O

the O

Severe O
RSV O
infections O
(i.e., O
requiring O
hospitalization) O
during O
infancy O
are O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
subsequent O
wheeze O
and O
pulmonary O
dysfunction O
including O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
asthma O
in O
later O
life O
[ O
6 O
, O
11 O
, O
12 O
, O
36 O
– O
41 O
]. O
One O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
RSV O
bronchiolitis O
is O
simply O
more O
severe O
in O
atopic O
individuals. O
In O
fact, O
our O
studies O
demonstrated O
that O
interactions O
between O
RSV O
infection O
and O
allergen-induced O
immune O
responses O
exacerbate O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
and O
airway O
physiology. O
Furthermore, O
the O
synergism O
between O
RSV O
and O
allergen O
leads O
to O
long-term O
pulmonary O
consequences O
such O
as O
airway O
remodeling O
and O
may O
explain O
progressive O
lung O
disease O
in O
humans. O
An O
alternative O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
severe O
RSV O
infections O
during O
infancy O
are O
a O
predisposing O
factor O
for O
the O
development O
of O
airway O
inflammatory O
disease O
states, O
such O
as O
asthma. O
In O
this O
scenario, O
RSV O
infection O
during O
infancy, O
when O
the O
immune O
system O
is O
still O
developing O
and O
is O
in O
a O
Th2-skewed O
state, O
initiates O
a O
Th2 O
polarized O
primary O
immune O
response O
and O
subsequently O
a O
Th2 O
polarized O
memory O
response O
to O
RSV O
[ O
41 O
]. O
Such O
a O
response O
may O
even O
be O
heightened O
in O
atopic O
individuals. O
Although O
compelling O
evidence O
in O
support O
of O
the O
later O
hypothesis O
comes O
from O
recently O
published O
data O
[ O
13 O

we O
did O
not O

It O
is O
important O
to O
point O
out O
that O
this O
may O
be O
due O
entirely O
to O

and O

data O
from O
our O

demonstrate O
that O

(i.e., O

leads O
to O
long-term O

therefore, O
it O

understand O
the O

which O

This O

This O

shows O
the O
importance O
of O
screening O

for O
parvovirus O
B19. O
This O
study O
is O
the O
first O
to O
investigate O
the O
prevalence O
of O
parvovirus O
B19 O
in O
Afghanistan. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
parvovirus O
B19 O
IgG O
was O
91.25% O
with O
43.75% O
PCR O
positivity O
among O
Afghanistan O
hemophilia O
patients, O
which O
is O
higher O
compared O
to O
hemophiliacs O
in O
Shiraz, O
Iran O
(with O
74% O
seropositivity O
among O
180 O
patients) O
33 O
. O
Basically, O
studies O
in O
different O
countries O
demonstrated O
a O
higher O
seroprevalence O
of O
parvovirus O
B19 O
among O
hemophilia O
patients. O
For O
instance, O
in O
one O
study O
of O
40 O
hemophilia O
patients O
in O
Japan, O
100% O
of O
patients O
were O
positive O
for O
parvovirus O
B19 O
IgG O
and O
7/5% O
of O
IgG-positive O
serum O
samples O
contained O
parvovirus O
B19 O
DNA O
34 O
. O
The O
seroprevalence O
of O
parvovirus O
B19 O
in O
Asian O
blood O
donors O
was O
found O
to O
be O
25–40% O
35 O
, O
36 O
. O
As O
parvovirus O
B19 O
can O
be O
transmitted O
by O
plasma-derived O
medicinal O
products, O
the O
prevalence O
of O
parvovirus O
B19 O
-specific O
antibodies O
is O
much O
higher O
in O
groups O
receiving O
blood O
products O
and O
clotting O
factors O
than O
in O
other O
groups O
37 O
. O
In O
general, O
transmission O
of O
blood-borne O
infections O
via O
plasma-derived O
medicinal O
products O
occur O
because O
of O
incomplete O
elimination O
of O
virus O
and O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Parvovirus O
B19 O
the O
resistance O
of O
the O

NAT(Nucleic O

screening O
for O
parvovirus O
B19 O
is O
the O
current O
universal O
screening O
of O
donated O
blood O
40 O
. O
This O
method O
cannot O
detect O
new O
or O
emerging O
viruses, O
so O
it O
may O
not O
be O
totally O
effective O
at O
preventing O
the O

We O
hypothesize O
that O
the O

may O
aid O
in O

thereby O
optimizing O
the O

of O
the O

Furthermore, O
both O
functions O
are O
of O
potential O

for O
biobased O
applications: O
we O
identified O
a O
number O
of O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
lignocellulose O
break O
down O
and O
encoding O
compounds O
with O

activity. O
Aside O
from O
constituting O
beneficial O
traits O
for O
an O
animal O
living O
in O

soil O
environment, O
these O
functions O
may O
also O
represent O
good O
targets O
for O
drug O
discovery O
and O
for O
the O
development O
of O
biotechnological O
applications. O
Using O
a O
comparative O
analysis O
between O
genes O
of O
the O
gut O

and O
foreign O
genes O
in O
F. O
candida, O
we O
have O
identified O

Approximately O
90% O

in O
these O

by O

However, O
when O

together, O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
obtain O

After O

only O

A O

was O
seen O
at O
embryonic O

(Fig. O

These O

indicate O
that O
the O
Polr3b O

is O
embryonically O
lethal O
at O
or O
before O

similarly O
to O

[ O

This O

POLR3A O

Thus, O
the O

Of O
note, O
the O

has O
occurred O
in O
the O
hospital O
as O
indicated O
by O
the O

Further O
study O
is O
needed O
to O
investigate O
the O
origin O
and O
the O
route O
of O
the O
transmission. O
In O
cluster O
C82-II O
and O
cluster O
C82-III, O
the O
HCA O
strains O
and O
nosocomial O
strains O
showed O
the O
same O
PFGE O
profiles, O
suggesting O
the O
cross O
transmission O
of O
CRKP O
among O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
patients. O
CRKP O
strains O
could O
be O
introduced O
into O
the O
hospital, O
then O
spread O
within O
the O
institution O
and O
might O
cause O
nosocomial O
infections O
during O
the O
entry O
of O
HCA O
patients O
with O
CRKP O
infections, O
of O
which O
we O
should O
keep O
alert. O
Identical O
profiles O
among O
HCA O
CRKP O
isolates O
implies O
the O
clonal O
spread O
of O
K. B-PATH

among O
HCA O
patients. O
It O
suggests O
the O
healthcare-associated O
transmission O
of O
CRKP O
strains O
in O
the O
local O
area. O
In O
addition, O
the O
same O
PFGE O
profiles O
were O
observed O
in O
strains O
carrying O
different O
resistance O
gene O
profiles, O
suggesting O
later O
acquisition O
of O
the O
resistance O
genes O
via O
horizontal O
transfer O
under O
antibiotic O
selection O
pressure. O
The O
main O
finding O
in O
the O
present O
study O
was O
that O
the O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
of O
HCA O
isolates O
was O
similar O
in O
severity O
to O
nosocomial O
isolates. O
This O
study O
was O
conducted O
at O
a O
tertiary O
hospital O
in O
Guangzhou O
city, O
Guangdong O
province, O
where O
more O
severe O
patients O
from O
all O
over O
the O
province O
or O
neighboring O
provinces O
had O
been O
hospitalized O
and O
approximately O
20% O
had O
been O
referred O
from O
other O
hospitals, O
which O
could O
explain O
the O
serious O
drug O
resistance O
in O
the O
HCA O
group O
in O
our O
study. O
Given O
distinct O
features O
of O
K. O
pneumoniae O
strains O
from O
different O
regions, O
more O
epidemiological O
data O
on O
nosocomial, O
HCA, O
and O
CA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections O
are O
needed O
to O
better O
manage O
patients. O
Conclusions O
HCA O
K. B-PATH
pneumoniae I-PATH
infections O
were O
similar O
to O
nosocomial O
infections O
regarding O
clinical O
features O
and O
antimicrobial O
resistance, O
and O
were O
different O
to O
CA O
infections. O
CRKP O
and O
ESBL-producing O
strains O
were O
mainly O
prevalent O
in O
patients O
with O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
infections, O
showing O
genetic O
diversity. O

Indeed, O
numerous O
POLR3-HLD O
cases O
with O
compound O
heterozygous O
alleles O
are O
known O
to O
include O
one O
allele O
with O
a O
frameshift O
or O
nonsense O
mutation O
[ O
5 O
]. O
Since O
we O
have O
only O
studied O
two O
mutations O
thus O
far, O
further O
experiments O
on O
other O
POLR3A O
and O
POLR3B O
mutations O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
confirm O
such O
a O
correlation. O
This O
does O
not O
preclude O
that O
other O
mutations, O
perhaps O
ones O
that O
have O
a O
moderate O
effect O
on O
chromatin O
occupancy O
or O
transcription O
elongation, O
might O
lead O
to O
a O
clinical O
mouse O
phenotype O
recapitulating O
the O
human O
disease. O
We O
recently O
showed O
that O
in O
human O
cell O
lines, O
the O
POLR3-HLD-causing O
POLR3A O
M862 O
V O
mutation O
does O
not O
impair O
Pol O
III O
complex O
assembly O
or O
nuclear O
import O
but O
leads O
to O
decreased O
levels O
of O
a O
subset O
of O
Pol O
III O
transcripts, O
including O
tRNAs O
and O
7SL O
RNA O
[ O
8 O
]. O
Thus, O
this O
mutation O
appears O
to O
have O
an O
intermediate O
functional O
phenotype O
in O
human O
cells O
that O
could O
perhaps O
lead O
to O
a O
neurological O
phenotype O
in O
mouse. O
Examining O
the O
functional O
impact O
of O
a O
larger O
panel O
of O
mutations O
in O
human O
cells O
could O
help O
pinpoint O
those O
that O
may O
produce O
a O
mouse O
phenotype, O
though O
mouse O
brain O
development O
may O
be O
less O
susceptible O
than O

Third O

absent O
from O
a O
large O
proportion O

of O

In O
a O
few O
cases, O
such O
as O
the O

current O
information O
indicates O
that O
the O

However, O
in O

only O
a O

it O

In O

such O

are O

These O
findings O
imply O
that O
in O
the O

as O
a O
whole O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
were O
probably O
originally O

The O
interview O

expanded O
on O
the O

results, O
particularly O
with O
respect O
to O

Several O
talked O
about O
the O
uncertainty O
presented O
by O
climate O
change, O
particularly O
with O
changing O
precipitation O
patterns O
and O
timing O
of O

Climate O
change O
was O
also O
thought O
by O
some O
respondents O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
increasing O
disease O
pressure. O
The O
interviews O
took O
place O
after O
a O
particularly O
wet O
season, O
and O
at O
least O
two O
producers O
reported O
partial O
or O
complete O
crop O
failures. O
Rains O
before O
harvest O
resulted O
in O
crops O
that O
were O
too O
wet O
to O
satisfactorily O
harvest. O
Barley—like O
wheat O
in O
the O
USA—has O
low O
operating O
costs, O
high O
capital O
costs, O
and O
tends O
to O
be O
a O
low-margin O
or O
break-even O
crop. O
However, O
when O
overhead O
costs O
were O
factored O
in, O
the O
net O
margin O
was O
slightly O
negative O
given O
the O
relatively O
high O
capital O
investment O
costs. O
Organic O
wheat O
is O
similarly O
a O
low-margin O
crop O
when O
compared O
with O
maize O
and O

However, O
there O
were O
great O
regional O
differences O
in O
cost O
of O
production O
as O
well O
as O

per O

Irrigated O

had O
higher O

but O
also O
higher O

and, O
based O
on O
the O

less O
risk O
of O
crop O

in O
a O
dry O

In O
contrast, O
the O

CLO/PXG O
genes O
amongst O
fungal O
species, O
where O
even O
inside O
many O
genera O
some O
species O
might O
contain O
the O
gene O
while O
others O
do O
not, O
suggests O
that O
CLO/PXG O
is O
more O
of O
an O
accessory O
gene O
in O
the O
fungi O
that O
may O
be O
beneficial O
to O
have O
in O
particular O
environments O

Conclusions O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
analysed O
the O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
family O
in O
the O
fungi O
and O
other O
non-plant O
clades. O
This O
complements O
our O
recent O
analysis O
of O
the O
CLO/PXG O
gene O
family O
in O
the O
Viridiplantae O
[ O
4 O
]. O
Whereas O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
are O
ubiquitous O
in O
the O
land O
plants O
(Streptophytes), O
they O
are O
only O
found O
in O
about O
30% O
of O
the O
sequenced O
fungal O
genomes O
that O
we O
were O
able O
to O
recover O
from O
public O
databases. O
However, O
CLO/PXG O
genes O
are O
present O
in O
all O
of O
the O
major O
fungal O
taxa, O
inferring O
that O
they O
have O
been O
selectively O
lost O
in O
some O
fungal O
lineages O
over O
the O
past O
one O
billion O
years O
of O
evolution. O
CLO/PXG-like O
genes O
were O
also O
present O
in O
only O
three O
out O
of O
the O
many O
hundreds O
of O
sequenced O
non-fungal O
Opisthokont O
genomes O
including O
an O
Amoebozoan, O
a O
Holozoan O
and O
a O
Metazoan, O
although O
whether O
the O
unusual O
presence O
of O
these O
genes O
is O
the O
result O
of O
HGT O
remains O
an O
open O
question. O
Functional O
experiments O
in O
this O
study O
and O
elsewhere O
show O
that O
fungal O
CLO/PXGs O
have O
similar O
but O
not O
identical O
roles O
to O
those O
in O
plants, O
including O
stress-related O
oxylipin O
signalling, O
lipid O
metabolism, O
reproduction O
and O
pathogenesis. O
While O
the O
presence O
of O
CLO/PXG O
orthologs O
in O
all O
plant O
genomes O
sequenced O
to O
date O
would O
suggest O
that O
they O
have O
core O
housekeeping O
functions O
in O
plants, O
the O
selective O
loss O
of O
CLO/PXGs O
in O
many O
fungal O
genomes O
suggests O
more O
restricted O
functions O
in O
fungi O
as O
accessory O
genes O
useful O
in O
particular O
environments O
or O

The O

is O
important O
as O

alterations O
in O

partially O
due O
to O

Ultimately O
these O

Any O
type O

will O
trigger O
some O
degrees O

[ O

When O
plants O
are O

by O
pathogens, O
variable O
amounts O
of O

are O
released O
to O
activate O
the O

and O
expression O
of O
a O
series O

genes O
[ O

The O
activation O
of O
ROS O
is O
a O
common O
form O

non-host O

that O
universally O
occurs O
in O

regardless O
of O
their O

in O
the O

[ O

In O
addition O
to O
these O
common O
disease-responsive O
genes, O
another O
1284 O
disease-responsive O
genes O
were O
differentially O
expressed O
between O
LR-66-637 O

Some O

may O
contribute O
to O
the O

According O
to O
the O

Furthermore, O
our O
previous O

demonstrated O
that O

increase O
in O

that O

Thus, O
these O

cumulatively O
suggest O
that O
the O

this O

Severe O
RSV O
infections O
(i.e., O
requiring O

during O

are O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O

in O

One O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
RSV O
bronchiolitis O
is O
simply O
more O
severe O
in O
atopic O
individuals. O
In O
fact, O
our O
studies O
demonstrated O
that O
interactions O
between O
RSV O
infection O
and O
allergen-induced O
immune O
responses O
exacerbate O
pulmonary O
inflammation O
and O
airway O
physiology. O
Furthermore, O
the O
synergism O
between O
RSV O
and O
allergen O
leads O
to O
long-term O
pulmonary O
consequences O
such O
as O
airway O
remodeling O
and O
may O
explain O
progressive O
lung O
disease O
in O
humans. O
An O
alternative O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
severe O
RSV O
infections O
during O
infancy O
are O
a O
predisposing O
factor O
for O
the O
development O
of O
airway O
inflammatory O
disease O
states, O
such O
as O
asthma. O

Hence, O
each O
plant O
species, O
cultivar O

have O
specific O
optimal O
temperature O
ranges O
for O
physiological O
functions O
that O
includes O

those O
ranges O

Thus, O

only O
used O

Using O
this, O
it O

the O

We O

the O

while O

was O
0.793 O
(95% O

0.699–0.898). O
This O
showed O
that O
regular O

had O
a O

Bawadi O

studied O
the O
relationship O

by O
randomly O

The O
subjects O
were O
divided O
into O
three O
categories: O
low, O
moderate, O
and O
high O
physical O

The O
high O

had O
a O
significantly O
lower O
average O

They O
suggested O
that O
decreased O
physical O
activity O
and O

were O
significantly O
associated O
with O
periodontitis. O
Al-Zahrani O

22 O
also O
reported O
the O
relationship O
between O
physical O

and O
the O
prevalence O
of O
periodontitis. O
They O
used O
the O
NHANES O
III O
subjects O
(n O
= O
2,521) O
and O
suggested O
that O
a O
high O
level O
of O
physical O
activity O
can O
prevent O
periodontitis. O
Anderson O
et O
al. O
29 O
evaluated O
the O
relationship O
between O
physical O

and O
periodontal O

They O
reported O
that O

positive O
association O
with O
the O
antibodies O
in O
the O

Although O
they O
did O
not O
use O
regular O

as O
a O
separate O

modifier, O
these O
results O
are O
similar O
to O
the O
findings O
of O
our O
study O
and O
support O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
physical O
activity O
reduces O
the O
prevalence O
of O

Three O
main O
mechanisms O
may O
explain O
the O
association O
between O
regular O
walking O
and O
periodontitis: O
oxidative O
stress, O
inflammation, O
and O
insulin O
resistance. O
Firstly, O
regular O
walking O
may O
decrease O
oxidative O
stress. O

General O
characteristic O
of O
the O
Xenorhabdus O

The O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
belong O
to O
the O
family O
Enterobacteriaceae O
within O
Gammaproteobacteria O
(Imhoff O

). O
They O
are O
not O
the O
only O
γ-Proteobacteria O
that O
establish O
mutualistic O
symbiosis O
with O
nematodes. O
Research O
data O
indicate O
that O
Moraxella O

(family O
Pseudomonadaceae) O
can O
enter O
symbiosis O
with O
a O
slug-parasitizing O
nematode O
Phasmarhabditis O
hermaphrodita, O
whereas O
entomopathogenic O
Serratia O

(family O

have O
been O
found O
to O
associate O
with O
Oscheius O
and O
Caenorhabditis O
nematodes O
enabling O
their O
success O
as O
insect O
pathogens. O
Although O
these O
symbiotic O
associations O
seem O
not O
to O

obligate, O
they O
suggest O
that O
the O
ability O

may O
have O
arisen O
several O
times O
during O
the O

(Husnik O

Likewise, O
the O
1995 O

journals O
(‘Journal O

used O
undergraduate O

95.8% O

of O
all O

respectively O
(Gallander O
Wintre O
et O

2001 O
), O
and O
Arnett O
( O

calculated O
that O
74% O

the O

in O
the O

were O
from O

The O
issues O
relating O
to O

are O
not O

to O
(social) O
psychology, O
and O
similar O
concerns O
have O

(Bello O

). O
For O
example, O
Peterson O
( O

reviewed O
the O
literature O
in O
consumer O
research O
and O
found O
86% O

from O
students. O
Online O
Participants O
Perhaps O
in O
part O
as O
a O
response O
to O
these O
sorts O
of O
criticisms, O
(social) O
psychologists O
have O
increasingly O
turned O
to O
online O
platforms O
to O
recruit O
participants O
who O
are O
not O
students O
(e.g. O
Gosling O
et O
al. O
2004 O
; O
Gosling O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Gosling O
and O
Johnson O
2010 O
). O
Over O
the O
past O
decade, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
strong O
increase O
in O
the O
use O
of O
participants O
crowdsourced O
via O
online O
platforms, O
such O
as O
Amazon O
MTurk O
or O
CrowdFlower O
(e.g. O
Buhrmester O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Paolacci O
and O
Chandler O
2014 O
). O
Such O
expansion O
has O
benefited O
psychological O
research O
in O
many O
ways. O
For O
example, O
results O
from O
classic O
behavioural O
experiments O
(e.g. O
the O
Stroop O
Task; O
Stroop O
1935 O
) O
were O
shown O
to O
replicate O
well O
on O
these O
online O
platforms O
(Crump O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Even O
when O
studying O
political O
ideologies, O
it O
seems O
that O
MTurk O
is O
well-suited O
(Clifford O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
However, O
although O
Amazon O
boasts O
&gt; O
.5 O
million O
participants, O
the O
actual O
pools O
from O
which O
participants O
are O
sampled O
are O
much O
smaller, O
with O
the O
population O
estimated O
at O
around O
7300 O
individuals O
(Bohannon O

). O

Although O
purified O
T O

demonstrated O
a O
significant O
increase O
of O

In O
contrast O
to O
the O
decreased O
expression O
of O
the O

SLC20A1 O

in O
PBMCs, O
we O
noted O
the O
loss O
of O
SLC20A1 O
once O
T O
cells O
were O
purified O
(Supplementary O
Fig. O

). O
This O
was O
independent O
of O

and O
suggests O
that O
purification O

alter O
expression O

some O

Owing O
to O
this O
loss, O
the O

We O
next O
investigated O
the O
relationship O
between O
metabolic O

and O
T-cell O

(Fig. O

). O
The O

showed O
positive O

multiple O
metabolic O

Conversely, O
a O
negative O
correlation O
between O

a O
difference O
in O
metabolic O
requirements O
of O
fatty-acid O

for O
early O

Specifically, O
the O
strongest O
correlation O
was O
seen O
between O
GLUT1 O
and O
CD25 O
(r O
= O
0.8571), O
indicating O
a O
positive O
relationship O
between O
capacity O
for O

and O
CD25 O
expression O
with O

(Fig. O

and O
demonstrated O
by O
the O

in O
the O
FitSNE O
projection O
of O

(Fig. O

This O
directly O
correlates O
the O

to O
the O
IL-2 O

CD25, O
to O
the O

(Supplementary O

In O

cells, O
we O
further O
demonstrate O
differential O
metabolic O

Though O
at O

Among O

we O
found O
that O
most O

(from O

responded O
only O
to O

(92%, O

some O
responded O
both O
to O

and O
1 O
cell O

was O
activated O
only O
by O

Similar O

When O

(Fig. O

most O

Subsequently, O

A O

that O

It O
appears O
that O

In O
this O

After O

we O
found O
that O

Moreover, O
many O

biological, O
and O
cultural O
factors O
have O
influenced O
the O
relationships O
established O
between O
humans O
and O
the O
different O
components O
of O
nature. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
human-nature O
interactions, O
societies O
have O
constructed O
different O
sets O
of O
knowledge O
over O
time. O
Traditional O
ecological O
knowledge O
represents O
the O
culmination O
of O
wisdom, O
practices, O
and O
beliefs O
transmitted O
generationally O
regarding O
the O
relationship O
of O
living O
things O
(Berkes O
et O
al. O
2000 O
). O
The O
knowledge O
sets O
of O
human O
groups O
are O
not O
dissociated O
but O
rather O
form O
part O
of O
a O
worldview O
that O
unites O
the O
past O
with O
the O
future O
and O
integrates O
visible O
elements O
and O
materials O
with O
those O
that O
are O
subjective O
and O
mystic O
as O
well O
as O
everyday O
practices O
(Escobar-Berón O
2002 O
). O
The O
perception O
that O
humans O
form O
part O
of O
a O
greater O
whole O
is O
mainly O
observed O
in O
indigenous O
groups, O
contrasting O
with O
the O
anthropocentric O
Western O
vision O
introduced O
during O
colonization O
in O
which O
humans O
do O
not O
form O
part O
of O
nature O
but O
instead O
utilize O
nature O
to O
obtain O
resources O
(Plumwood O
2006 O
). O
Mexico O
is O
a O
culturally O
and O
biologically O
diverse O
country O
where O
the O
traditional O
knowledge O
of O
each O
region O
and O
among O
its O
peoples O
has O
been O
conserved O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
(Boege O
2008 O
). O
The O
use O
of O
mushrooms O
has O
been O
documented O
in O
15 O
of O
the O
68 O
indigenous O
groups O
of O
Mexico O
and O
in O
various O
mestizo O
communities O
living O
in O
rural O
areas O
(Garibay-Orijel O
and O
Ruan-Soto O
2014 O
) O
—understanding O
Mexican O
mestizos O
as O
those O
resulted O
by O
the O
mixture O
of O
Amerindian O
and O
European O
ancestors O
(Silva-Zolezzi O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
Each O
culture O
has O
been O
related O
in O
different O
ways O
to O
fungi, O
given O
way O
to O
a O
great O
plurality O
of O
ethnomycological O
knowledge O
(Ruan-Soto O
et O
al. O
2014 O
), O
according O
to O
the O
identity O
of O
each O
person O
and O
the O
place O
where O
they O
develop O
(Mapes O
et O
al. O
2002 O
). O
Throughout O
the O
country, O
there O
are O
sites O
where O
indigenous O
and O
mestizos O
groups O
co-exist. O
One O
example O
is O
in O
the O
northern O
region O
of O
Jalisco O
where O
both O
Wixarika O
(or O
Huichol) O
and O
mestizo O
groups O
are O
found. O
The O
Wixaritari O
(sing. O
Wixarika) O
are O
known O
for O
their O
culture O
and O
the O
way O
to O
interpret O
the O
world O
(Neurath O
2013 O
). O

Introduction O
Several O
experimental O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
synergistic O
interaction O
between O
respiratory O
viral O
infections O
and O
allergic O
inflammation O
that O
exacerbate O
asthma O
[ O
1 O
– O
3 O
]. O
RSV O
is O
the O
most O
common O
respiratory O
pathogen O
during O
infancy, O
and O
the O
majority O
of O
children O
worldwide O
have O
been O
infected O
with O
it O
by O
2 O
years O
of O
age[ O
4 O
]. O
Several O
retrospective O
studies O
have O
suggested O
a O
link O
between O
RSV O
lower O
respiratory O
tract O
infections O
in O
infancy O
and O
the O
later O
development O
of O
asthma O
[ O
5 O
– O
10 O
]. O
In O
a O
more O
recent O
study O
conducted O
by O
Sigurs O
and O
colleagues O
using O
a O
cohort O
of O
140 O
children O
(47 O
of O
whom O
were O
hospitalized O
for O
RSV O
bronchiolitis O
during O
the O
first O
year O
of O
life O
and O
a O
control O
population O
of O
93 O
infants O
with O
no O
history O
of O
RSV O
infection), O
it O
was O
found O
that O
by O
7 O
years O
of O
age O
30% O
of O
the O
children O
in O
the O
RSV O
group O
had O
experienced O
recurrent O
physician-diagnosed O
&quot;wheeze&quot; O
(ie, O
asthma) O
as O
compared O
to O
3% O
of O
the O
control O
group[ O
11 O
]. O
Multivariant O
analyses O
further O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
greatest O
risk O
factor O
for O
asthma O
was O
RSV O
bronchiolitis O
independent O
of O
a O
family O
history O
of O
atopy. O
Moreover, O
the O
Tucson O
Children's O
Respiratory O
Study O
demonstrated O
that O
even O
children O
with O
mild O
RSV O
infections O
were O
4 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
recurrent O
wheeze O
by O
6 O
years O
of O
age[ O
12 O
]. O
Cumulatively, O
the O
data O
suggest O
that O
RSV O
bronchiolitis O
in O
infancy O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
wheeze, O
which O
may O
persist O
for O
several O
years O
and O
is O
not O
adequately O
explained O
by O
a O
family O
history O
of O
atopy. O
Whether O
RSV O
directly O
contributes O
to O
the O
development O
of O
asthma O
remains O
unclear. O
A O
recent O
study O
using O
an O
animal O
model O
of O
RSV O
infection O
demonstrated O
that O
&quot;infections O
in O
early O
life O
play O
an O
important O
role&quot; O
in O
shaping O
the O
secondary O
immune O
response O
to O
antigen O
leading O
to O
long-term O
consequences O
for O
the O
host[ O
13 O
]. O
In O
this O
study, O
Culley O
and O
colleagues O
showed O
that O
the O
age O
of O
initial O
infection O
played O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
the O
secondary O
response O
of O
these O
same O
animals O
to O
rechallenge O
with O
RSV O
at O
12 O
weeks O
of O
age. O

For O
example, O
the O
recent O
experimental O
study O
of O
Holmqvist O
et O
al O
demonstrated O
that O
α-synuclein, O
the O
presynaptic O
neuronal O
protein O
which O
is O
abundantly O
expressed O
in O
the O
brain, O
was O
presented O
in O
PD O
brain O
lysate O
and O
distinct O
recombinant O
α-synuclein O
forms O
were O
transported O
via O
the O
vagal O
nerve O
and O
reached O
the O
dorsal O
motor O
nucleus O
of O
the O
vagus O
in O
the O
brainstem O
in O
a O
time-dependent O
manner O
after O
injection O
into O
the O
intestinal O
wall. O
The O
authors O
indicated O
that O
different O
α-synuclein O
forms O
can O
spread O
from O
the O
gut O
to O
the O
brain, O
and O
that O
microtubule-associated O
transport O
is O
joined O
in O
the O
translocation O
of O
aggregated O
α-synuclein O
in O
neurons O
(Holmqvist O
et O
al., O
2014 O
). O
In O
addition, O
Scheperjans O
et O
al O
studied O
the O
microbiota O
composition O
in O
PD O
patients O
and O
healthy O
controls. O
The O
results O
suggested O
a O
significant O
decrease O
of O
Prevotellaceae O
in O
PD O
patients O
and O
the O
subjects O
with O
a O
lower O
abundance O
of O
Prevotellaceae O
(&lt;6.5% O
in O
relative O
abundance) O
showed O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
PD. O
In O
another O
study, O
the O
abundance O
of O
Enterobacteriaceae O
was O
positively O
correlated O
with O
the O
severity O
of O
PD O
regarding O
gait O
difficulty O
and O
postural O
instability O
(Scheperjans O
et O
al., O
2015 O
). O
The O
role O
of O
gut O
microbiota O
in O
ad O
via O
the O
inflammation O
regulatION O
Inflammation O
is O
the O
body’s O
response O
to O
infections O
and O
tissue O
injury O
and O
the O
inflammatory O
response O
is O
orchestrated O
by O
the O
cells O
of O
the O
immune O
system; O
both O
from O
the O
“adaptive” O
branch O
(including O
T- O
and O
B-cells O
with O
the O
capacity O
to O
induce O
long-term O
memory O
of O
encountered O
pathogens, O
“immunisation”) O
and O
the O
“innate” O
branch O
(including O
monocytes, O
macrophages, O
dendritic O
cells, O
and O
mast O
cells, O
that O
are O
targeted O
against O
common O
pathogen O
antigens). O

A O
limitation O
of O
our O
methodology O
is O
that O
co-infection O
of O
ecotypes O
would O
not O
be O
discovered. O
The O
high O
infection O
prevalence O
of O
both O
ecotypes O
in O
moose O
makes O
it O
likely O
that O
mixed O
infections O
can O
be O
common. O
This O
could O
be O
addressed O
with O
other O
methods O
such O
as O
Reverse O
Line O
Blot O
in O
future O
work. O
Obtaining O
sequence O
data O
from O
positive O
samples O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
required O
for O
determination O
of O
ecotype O
can O
be O
challenging. O
We O
had O
a O
fairly O
low O
success O
(42–57%) O
in O
obtaining O
sequence O
data, O
and O
the O
sequencing O
success O
was O
good O
when O
Ct O
values O
(i.e. O
the O
number O
of O
PCR O
cycles O
before O
getting O
a O
positive O
signal) O
were O
below O
30. O
This O
highlights O
the O
need O
for O
large O
sample O
sizes. O
There O
are O
only O
two O
previous O
groEL O
sequences O
reported O
from O
A. O
phagocytophilum O
isolated O
from O
moose O
tissue. O
One O
sequence O
derived O
from O
a O
mainland O
moose O
in O
Sweden O
was O
an O
exact O
match O
of O
the O
sequence O
(GQ988754) O
from O
roe O
deer O
in O
Austria O
[ O
39 O
] O
clustering O
to O
ecotype O
II, O
while O
the O
sequence O
derived O
from O
a O
moose O
from O
the O
Island O
of O
Öland, O
Sweden O
clustered O
to O
ecotype O
I O
[ O
15 O
]. O
There O
are O
no O
red O
deer O
on O
Öland, O
but O
still O
ecotype O
I O
was O
found O
there. O
Together O
with O
our O
discovery O
of O
frequent O
infection O
of O
ecotype O
I O
in O
moose, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
questing O
ticks O
in O
an O
area O
without O
red O
deer, O
this O
is O
indeed O
indicative O
of O
moose O
as O
a O
potential O
transmission O
host O
of O
ecotype O
I. O
Conclusion O
Our O
study O
provides O
one O
crucial O
step O
forward O
towards O
identifying O
assumed O
transmission O
hosts O
at O
the O
northern O
distribution O
ranges, O
and O
we O
have O
provided O
the O
first O
results O
potentially O
linking O
moose O
to O
both O
ecotype O
I O
and O
II O
of O
A. O
phagocytophilum. O
The O
importance O
of O
a O
given O
host O
for O
the O
disease O
hazard O
also O
depends O
on O
their O
abundance O
and O
the O
number O
of O
ticks O
feeding O
on O
them O
[ O
40 O
, O
41 O
]. O
Red O
deer O
can O
generally O
reach O
higher O
population O
densities O
than O
moose, O
while O
roe O
deer O
have O
highly O
variable O
densities O
that O
can O
be O
very O
high O
locally O
[ O

Pathogen O
A O

of O
M. O

originally O
collected O
in O

was O
used O
in O

Inoculations O
were O
performed O
following O
the O

Briefly, O
a O
culture O
of O
M. O

cultured O
on O
potato O
dextrose O
agar O
(PDA) O
was O
incubated O
at O

Twenty-one O
days O

were O
pushed O
into O
the O
media O
wide O
end O
down O
around O
the O
outer O

of O
the O

Soybean O

were O
cut, O
using O
a O
razor O
blade, O
40 O
mm O
above O
the O
unifoliate O

A O

M. O

mock-inoculated O

was O
placed O
onto O
the O
open O

site, O
imbedding O
the O
tip O
of O
the O
stem O
into O
the O
media O
allowing O
the O
pathogen O
to O
spread O
into O
the O
plant O
tissue. O
After O
mock-inoculation, O
the O
mock-inoculated O
plants O
remained O
green O
and O
healthy. O
However, O
in O
response O
to O
the O
fungal O
colonization O
in O
the O
inoculated O
plants, O
a O
reddish-brown O
exterior O
lesion O
developed, O
followed O
by O
progressing O
dead O
tissue O
often O
containing O
black O
microsclerotia. O
A O
reddish-brown O
interior O
lesion O
also O
developed, O
often O
progressing O
farther O
down O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
stem O
than O
was O
visible O
on O
the O
exterior O
of O
the O
stem. O
To O
capture O
symptom O
progression, O
three O
lesion O
length O
measurements O
were O
obtained O
in O

by O
measuring O
the O

to O
the O
farthest O
progressed O
visible O

of O
the O

on O
the O
exterior O
of O
the O

to O
prevent O
necrosis O
of O
the O
inoculated O
site O
from O
interfering O
with O
accurate O
measurements. O
The O
progression O
of O
dead O

was O
measured O
in O
the O

However, O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
that O
Y. O

despite O
several O

studies O
6 O
, O
8 O
, O
41 O
. O
Before O
this O
study, O
it O
was O
unknown O
whether O
ancestral O
strains O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
were O
capable O
of O
causing O
primary O
pneumonic O

and O
at O
what O
point O
during O
the O
evolution O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
they O
became O
competent O
to O
do O
so. O
Here O
we O
report O
that O
ancestral, O
branch O
0 O
strains O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
gained O
the O
ability O
to O
successfully O
replicate O
to O
high O
levels O
within O
the O
pulmonary O
compartment O
very O
early O
in O
their O
evolution O
from O
Y. O
pseudotuberculosis, O
but O
only O
if O
they O
had O
acquired O
the O
gene O
encoding O
the O
Pla O
protease. O
This O
provides O
additional O
support O
for O
the O
acquisition O
of O
pPCP1 O
as O
a O
critical O
step O
in O
the O
adaptation O
of O
Y. O
pestis O
to O
the O
pulmonary O
environment. O
While O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
Y. O
pseudotuberculosis O
can O
colonize O
the O
lungs O
and O
stimulate O
a O
pneumonia O
in O
mice, O
the O
disease O
is O
delayed O
and O
does O
not O
exhibit O
the O
pulmonary O
pathology O
or O
rapid O
systemic O
spread O
that O
is O
observed O
during O
infections O
with O
Y. O
pestis O
42 O
. O
Furthermore, O
Y. O
pseudotuberculosis O
is O
not O
known O
to O
naturally O
cause O
epidemics O
of O

disease. O
While O
Pestoides O
F O
is O
one O
of O
the O
earliest O
existing O

in O

0 O
following O
the O
divergence O
of O
the O
species O
from O
Y. O
pseudotuberculosis O
( O

), O
here O
the O
addition O
of O
pPCP1 O
now O
confers O
Pestoides O
F O
with O
the O
higher O
pathogenicity O
observed O
in O
respiratory O
infections O
that O
are O
exhibited O
by O
the O
modern O
CO92 O
and O
KIM O
strains. O
This O
is O
the O
only O
genetic O
change O
needed O
by O
one O
of O
the O
most O
deeply O
rooted O
of O
all O
Y. O
pestis O
strains O
to O
cause O
a O
fulminant O
lung O
infection, O
and O
indicates O
that O
even O
during O
the O
transitional O
evolutionary O
state O
between O
Y. O
pseudotuberculosis O
and O
modern O
Y. O
pestis, O
this O
ancestral O
species O
was O
primed O
to O
cause O
pneumonic O
plague. O

For O
example, O
in O
the O
common O
pathogenic O
fungus, O
Aspergillus O
flavus, O
they O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
various O
aspects O
of O
aflatoxin O
storage, O
transport O
and O
secretion O
that O
have O
only O
been O
recognised O
very O
recently O
[ O
2 O
, O

] O
where O
it O
was O
reported O
that O
the O
silencing O
of O

AflCLO, O
the O
first O
characterized O
fungal O
caleosin O
with O
an O
experimentally O
proven O
PXG O
activity O
[ O
82 O
], O
reduced O
fungal O
aflatoxicogenicity O
and O
its O
capacity O
to O
infect O
maize O
[ O

]. O
A O
similar O
role O
for O
A. O
parasiticus O
caleosin O
gene O
was O
also O
suggested O
[ O
83 O
]. O
The O
data O
presented O
in O
Fig. O
5 O
show O
that O
oxylipins O
decrease O
the O
aflatoxicogenicity O
of O
A. O
flavus O
in O
vitro, O
probably O
via O
the O
down-regulation O
of O
the O
fungal O
CLO/PXG O
gene, O
AfPXG. O
As O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
5 O
a, O
in O
vitro O
treatment O
of O
A. O
flavus O
with O
oxylipins O
extracted O
from O
maize O
seedlings O
significantly O
affects O
fungal O
development. O
While O
the O
fungal O
mycelium O
weight O
was O
not O
affected O
as O
a O
function O
of O
oxylipin O
concentration, O
the O
fungi O
sporulated O
less O
actively O
under O
such O
treatment. O
This O
was O
found O
in O
all O
of O
the O
oxylipin-treated O
fungi O
with O
the O
highest O
dose O
(100 O
μM) O
producing O
about O
6 O
× O
10 O
6 O
spores O
per O
mL O
fewer O
than O
controls O
(Fig. O

). O
In O
parallel, O
the O
transcript O
level O
of O
the O
major O
A. O
flavus O
CLO/PXG O
gene, O
AfPXG, O
was O
reduced O
by O
about O
12.7-fold O
after O
exposure O
to O
oxylipins O
at O
100 O
μM. O
In O
parallel, O
the O
peroxygenase O
activity O
of O
AfPXG, O
as O
evaluated O
by O
hydroxylation O
of O
aniline, O
was O
decreased O
by O
the O
same O
order O
of O
magnitude O
(Fig. O

APCs, O
in O
turn, O
can O
migrate O

and O
activate O

Bacterial O
antigens O
may O
also O
be O
taken O
up O
by O
M O
cells O
to O
stimulate O
plasma O
cell O
development O
and O
IgA O
secretion O
in O
Peyer’s O
patches. O
Because O
GF O
mice O
have O
poor O
barrier O
function, O
MAMPs/PAMPs O
and O
antigens O
might O
also O
translocate O
into O
the O
circulation O
and O
affect O
systemic O
immunity. O
Commonly O
used O
sterile O
diets O
can O
have O
a O
range O
of O
levels O
of O
microbial O
residues. O
For O
instance, O
LPS O
content, O
as O
a O
measure O
of O
overall O
bacterial O
contamination O
in O
diets, O
shows O
a O
range O
of O
1–100 O
EU/μg O
[ O
84 O
]. O
A O
sterile O
diet O
rich O
in O
microbial O
residue O
can O
induce O
maturation O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
in O
a O
similar O
manner O
(albeit O
less O
prominently), O
as O
does O

[ O

Indeed, O
a O
sterile O
chow O
that O
contained O
high O
level O
of O
microbial O
residues O
resulted O
in O
decreased O
Th2-type O

GF O
mice O
compared O
to O
a O
sterile O
diet O
that O
was O

[ O

]. O
Use O
of O
chemically O

rather O
than O
conventional O

could O
uncouple O
the O

Evidence O

Multiple O

can O
profoundly O
influence O
the O
potency O
of O

and O
some O

(summarized O

Pioneering O

that O

Introduction O
Programmed O
cell O
death-1 O
(PD-1), O
an O
important O
inhibitory O
receptor, O
is O
critical O
for O
the O
maintenance O
of O
central O
and O
peripheral O
T O
cell O
tolerance. O
However, O
PD-1, O
which O
is O
upregulated O
on O
activated O
and O
exhausted O
T O
cells, O
also O
limits O
productive O
immune O
responses O
against O
pathogens O
and O
cancer O
cells. O
PD-1 O
signaling O
is O
induced O
upon O
binding O
of O
its O
ligands, O
PD-1 O
ligand-1 O
(PD-L1) O
and O
PD-1 O
ligand-2 O
(PD-L2). O
The O
expression O
of O
PD-L2 O
is O
mainly O
restricted O
to O
professional O
antigen O
presenting O
cells O
(APCs) O
like O
macrophages O
and O
dendritic O
cells O
(DCs), O
whereas O
PD-L1 O
is O
also O
expressed O
in O
non-hematopoietic O
tissues O
and O
can O
thus O
be O
regarded O
as O
the O
major O
PD-1 O
ligand. O
Importantly, O
PD-L1 O
is O
also O
upregulated O
in O
the O
tumor O
microenvironment O
and O
is O
found O
in O
a O
large O
variety O
of O
tumor O
cells. O
Tumor O
infiltrating O
lymphocytes O
frequently O
express O
PD-1, O
providing O
a O
rationale O
for O
therapeutically O
disrupting O
the O
PD-1/PD-L1 O
interaction O
to O
improve O
anti-tumor O
responses. O
Currently, O
several O
PD-1 O
and O
PD-L1 O
antibodies O
are O
in O
clinical O
use O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
various O
solid O
cancers O
and O
lymphomas, O
and O
blocking O
of O
the O
PD-1 O
pathway O
was O
shown O
to O
induce O
impressive O
response O
rates O
across O
a O
broad O
spectrum O
of O
tumor O
types O
1 O
, O
2 O
. O
Although O
the O
clinical O
indications O
for O
which O
regulatory O
authorities O
have O
approved O
antibodies O
targeting O
PD-1 O
and O
PD-L1 O
only O
partially O
overlap, O
the O
mode O
of O
action O
of O
these O
drugs O
is O
blocking O
PD-1 O
signaling. O
Therefore, O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
the O
ability O
of O
these O
agents O
to O
disrupt O
the O
function O
of O
PD-1 O
critically O
impacts O
their O
clinical O
efficacy. O
As O
with O
other O
drugs, O
dose O
response O
curves O
and O
half O
maximal O
effective O
concentrations O
(EC O
50 O
) O
provide O
valuable O
information O
on O
the O
efficacy O
of O
these O
antibodies. O
However, O
these O
values O
are O
not O
available O
for O
therapeutic O
PD-1 O
and O
PD-L1 O
antibodies, O
and O
the O
ability O
of O
these O
agents O
to O
block O
PD-1 O
signaling O
have O
not O
been O
compared O
in O
a O
functional O
assay. O

Expression O
of O
ICP0 O
also O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
resistance O
of O
HSV-1 O
to O
IFN-γ[ O
32 O
]. O
Thus O
explaining O
why O
IFNα/β O
or O
IFN-γ O
alone O
are O
weak O
inhibitors O
of O
HSV-1 O
wild O
type O
virus O
replication. O
Strikingly, O
recent O
studies O
showed O
that O
co-activation O
of O
IFNα/β O
and O
IFN-γ O
receptors O
renders O
cells O
highly O
resistant O
to O
HSV-1 O
replication O
[ O
20 O
]. O
This O
finding O
is O
turning O
to O
be O
a O
general O
phenomenon O
since O
a O
synergistic O
antiviral O
effect O
of O
the O
combination O
of O
IFN-α O
and O
IFN- O
γ O
was O
also O
demonstrated O
for O
other O
members O
of O
Herpesviridae O
[ O
20 O
, O
23 O
, O
33 O
] O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
RNA O

like O
SARS O
[ O

], O
Lassa O
virus O
[ O
35 O
] O
and O

[ O

Considering O
this O
background O
the O
current O
investigation O
was O
undertaken O
to O
determine O
if O
IFN O

inhibited O
in O
a O

could O
affect O
the O
antiviral O
state O
induced O
by O
IFN-α O
or O
IFN-γ O
or O
their O
combination. O
As O
expected, O
the O
results O
shown O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
Figure O
1a O
and O
Figure O
2b O
, O
clearly O
demonstrated O
that O
HSV-2 O
plaque O
formation, O
viral O
replication O
and O
the O
onset O
of O
viral O
CPE O
in O
Vero O
cells O
are O
synergistically O
inhibited O
by O
interferon O
combination. O
Whereas, O
individual O
cytokines O
were O
weak O
inducers O
of O
the O
antiviral O
response, O
independently O
of O
the O
concentration O
tried O
was O
100 O
or O
200 O
IU O
(Table O
1 O
). O
Importantly, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
two O
cytokines, O
individually O
or O
collectively, O
were O
harmful O
to O
uninfected O
or O
HSV-2 O
infected O
cells O
at O
the O
concentration O
used O
(Figure O
2a O
and O
2b O
). O
To O
the O
contrary, O
the O
cells O
remained O
viable O
after O
cytokine O
exposure O
for O
48 O
h O
after O
the O
induction O
period O
as O
assessed O
by O
MTT O
exclusion O
colorimetric O
method O
and O
remained O
able O
to O
proliferate O
(Figure O
2a O
) O
indicating O
that O
virus O
inhibition O
was O
the O
consequence O
of O
a O
blockade O
in O
virus O
replication O
and O
no O
to O

death. O

Regarding O
the O
chemical O
structure O
of O
drugs O
currently O
used O
against O
this O
infectious O
disease, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
the O
Leishmania O
spp. O
can O
be O
inhibited O
by O
compounds O
belonging O
to O
diverse O
chemical O
classes. O
This O
is O
of O
interest O
since O
endophytes O
are O
reputed O
to O
produce O
diverse O
structurally O
novel O
chemical O
scaffolds O
with O
outstanding O
activity. O
Therefore, O
researches O
are O
currently O
underway O
to O
identify O
and O
evaluate O
potential O
new O
candidates O
produced O
by O
plant O
endophytes. O
Antileishmanial O
Metabolites O
Produced O
by O
Endophytes O
The O
recent O
years O
have O
seen O
the O
increased O
interest O
of O
scientists O
to O
investigate O
endophytes O
for O
their O
ability O
to O
produce O
compounds O
with O
a O
cidal O
effect O
against O
Leishmania O
spp. O
This O
rush O
driven O
by O
the O
need O
for O
new O
treatment O
has O
led O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
several O
active O
metabolites O
with O
the O
potential O
to O
constitute O
a O
good O
starting O
point O
for O
novel O
anti-leishmanial O
drug O
discovery. O
Indeed, O
as O
a O
part O
of O
massive O
natural O
product O
drug O
discovery O
projects, O
extracts O
from O
more O
than O
2700 O
endophytic O
fungi O
were O
screened O
for O
their O
activity O
against O
several O
parasites O
including O
Leishmania B-PATH
donovani. I-PATH
The O
results O
show O
that O
up O
to O
17% O
of O
isolates O
were O
active O
and O
the O
most O
potent O
belonged O
to O
Nectriaceae, O
Trichocomaceae O
and O
Mycosphaerellaceae O
families O
[ O
24 O
]. O
In O
another O
investigation, O
one O
hundred O
and O
twenty-one O
endophytic O
fungi O
isolated O
from O
four O
Brazilian O
plants O
were O
tested O
against O
Leishmania O
amazonensis. O
Extracts O
from O
eleven O
fungi O
(9%) O
were O
able O
to O
inhibit O
the O
growth O
of O
L. O
amazonensis O
with O
IC O
50 O
values O
ranging O
from O
4.6 O
to O
24.4 O
µg/mL. O
The O
potent O
endophytic O
fungi O
were O
identified O
as O
belonging O
to O
the O
genera O
Alternaria, O
Arthrinium, O
Cochliobolus, O
Colletotrichum, O
Penicillium, O
Fusarium, O
and O
Gibberella O
[ O
25 O
]. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
endophytic O
fungi O
extracts O
may O
contain O
bioactive O
prototype O
molecules O
against O
Leishmania O
parasites O
and O
suggest O
that O
future O
chemical O
investigation O
may O
lead O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
potentially O
active O
compounds O
(Fig. O

). O

Therefore, O
there O
are O
no O
accurate O
reports O
of O
the O
incidence O
of O
hemophilia O
in O
this O
country. O
Modern O
treatment O
for O
hemophilia O
bleeding O
disorder O
started O
in O
the O
1970s, O
with O
the O
wide O
availability O
of O
safe O
plasma-derived O
coagulation O
factors O
and O
widespread O
adoption O
of O
home-administered O
replacement O
therapy O
led O
to O
the O
early O
control O
of O
hemorrhages. O
The O
optimistic O
perception O
of O
hemophilia O
changed O
at O
a O
time O
when O
plasma-derived O
concentrates O
manufactured O
from O
pooled O
plasma O
obtained O
from O
thousands O
of O
donors O
were O
invariably O
contaminated O
with O
hepatitis O
B, O
C O
virus O
and O
HIV O
and O
many O
patients O
exposed O
became O
infected O
4 O
. O
Consequent O
to O
widespread O
blood-borne O
virus O
transmission, O
the O
need O
for O
improved O
safety O
of O
treatment O
became O
crucial O
for O
the O
hemophilia O
community. O
The O
most O
important O
advance O
in O
this O
field O
was O
represented O
by O
recombinant O
gene O
technology O
which O
enabled O
the O
highly O
purified O
development O
of O
recombinant O
coagulation O
factors. O
So O
the O
evolution O
in O
the O
manufacturing O
process O
of O
recombinant O
factors O
during O
the O
last O
few O
years O
minimized O
the O
risk O
of O
pathogen O
transmission O
and O
improved O
the O
treatment O
and O
quality O
of O
life O
of O
hemophilia O
patients O
5 O
. O
Three O
pathogens O
are O
considered O
for O
most O
cases O
of O
acquired O
blood-borne O
infection: O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
(HIV), O
hepatitis O
B O
virus O
(HBV) O
and O
hepatitis O
C O
virus O
(HCV) O
6 O
. O
In O
addition, O
different O
viruses O
such O
as O
HTLV O
and O
parvovirus O
B19 O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
hemophiliacs. O
Afghanistan O
has O
a O
poor O
health O
infrastructure O
and O
accurate O
HIV O
awareness O
and O
knowledge O
among O
Afghans O
is O
low. O
Thus, O
a O
concentrated O
HIV O
epidemic O
may O
soon O
ensue O
due O
increase O
in O
high-risk O
behavior O
and O
intravenous O
drug O
use O
7 O
. O
In O
one O
cross-sectional O
study O
included O
464 O
adult O
injection O
drug O
users O
(IDUs) O
in O
Kabul, O
Afghanistan, O
from O
June O
2005 O
through O
June O
2006, O
the O
prevalence O
of O
HIV O
was O
3.0%(95% O
confidence O
interval O
[CI] O
1.7–5.1%). O

However, O
after O
vitrification, O
the O
number O
of O
these O
cells O
significantly O
decreased O
and O
the O
cell O
suspensions O
were O
partly O
enriched O
for O
the O
early-stage O
germ O
cells. O
Transplantation O
and O
incorporation O
of O
the O
cryopreserved O
spermatogonia O
To O
determine O
whether O
spermatogonia O
are O
functional O
and O
still O
have O
the O
capacity O
to O
colonize O
the O
recipient O
gonads O
and O
proliferate O
inside O
them O
after O
cryopreservation, O
fresh, O
frozen/thawed O
and O
vitrified/warmed O
spermatogonia O
from O
vasa::egfp O
transgenic O
line O
were O
transplanted O
into O
AB O
wild-type O
zebrafish O
larvae O
(7 O
dpf). O
Survival O
of O
the O
recipients O
was O
85 O
± O
5%, O
similar O
to O
the O
untreated O
control O
larvae O
(80 O
± O
3%, O
p O
&gt; O
0.05). O
Recipients O
of O
fresh O
spermatogonia O
dissected O
50 O
days O
after O
transplantation O
displayed O
a O
green O
fluorescent O
signal O
within O
their O
gonads O
indicating O
that O
donor O
cells O
had O
the O
ability O
to O
colonize O
the O
recipient O
gonads. O
Additionally, O
the O
large O
number O
of O
fluorescent O
cells O
forming O
colonies O
within O
the O
recipient O
gonads O
indicated O
that O
the O
donor O
cells O
were O
able O
to O
proliferate O
inside O
the O
recipient O
gonads O
(Fig. O
2A–C O
). O
Similarly, O
frozen O
and O
vitrified O
spermatogonia O
also O
retained O
their O
migrating O
ability O
as O
they O
incorporated O
into O
the O
recipient O
gonads, O
but O
also O
retained O
their O
mitotic O
activity O
as O
they O
also O
proliferated O
within O
the O
recipient O
gonads, O
similarly O
to O
the O
fresh O
cells O
(Fig. O
2B,C O
). O
Interestingly, O
transplanted O
spermatogonia O
incorporated O
and O
proliferated O
in O
gonads O
of O
both O
sexes, O
i.e. O
in O
both O
testes O
(Fig. O
2A,B O
) O
and O
ovaries O
(Fig. O
2C O
). O
The O
number O
of O
recipients O
containing O
incorporated O
donor-derived O
spermatogonia O
did O
not O
differ O
among O
the O
groups: O
14 O
of O
45 O
(31%) O
in O
the O
fresh O
control O
group; O
11 O
of O
45 O
(24%) O
in O
the O
frozen/thawed O
group; O
and O
10 O
of O
45 O
(22%) O
in O
the O
vitrified/warmed O
group O
(Fig. O
2G O
). O

Although O
these O
symbiotic O
associations O
seem O
not O
to O
be O
obligate, O
they O
suggest O
that O
the O
ability O
to O
engage O
in O
symbiosis O
with O
nematodes O
may O
have O
arisen O
several O
times O
during O
the O
evolution O
of O
γ-Proteobacteria O
(Husnik O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Dillman O
et O
al. O
2012 O
). O
Studies O
have O
established O
that O
the O
Photorhabdus O
and O
Xenorhabdus O
bacteria O
are O
phylogenetically O
close, O
in O
contrast O
to O
their O
EPN O
hosts O
Steinernema O
and O
Heterorhabditis, O
which O
represent O
distinct O
clades O
(Liu O
et O
al. O
1997 O
; O
Koppenhöfer O
2007 O
; O
Tailliez O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Stock O
2015 O
). O
As O
demonstrated O
by O
phylogenetic O
trees O
based O
on O
housekeeping O
genes, O
the O
Xenorhabdus O
and O
Photorhabdus O
bacteria O
form O
tight O
sister O
groups, O
while O
the O
genus O
Proteus O
is O
their O
nearest O
neighbor O
(Fig. O
2 O
). O
Current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
a O
common O
ancestor O
of O
these O
bacteria O
lived O
possibly O
about O
200–500 O
million O
years O
ago O
and O
it O
was O
able O
to O
associate O
with O
both O
Steinernema O
and O
Heterorhabditis O
nematode O
hosts. O
However, O
under O
the O
selective O
pressure O
of O
maintenance O
of O
long-term O
mutualistic O
interactions O
with O
the O
nematodes O
host, O
two O
separate O
genera O
of O
bacteria O
displaying O
host O
specific O
associations O
have O
evolved O
(Boemare O
2002 O
; O
Chaston O
et O
al. O
2011 O
). O
Studies O
have O
also O
revealed O
that O
a O
general O
trend O
in O
the O
EPN O
bacterial O
phylogeny O
is O
the O
increasing O
virulence O
associated O
with O
evolutionary O
trade-off O
between O
virulence O
and O
bacteriocin O
production O
abilities O
(Blackburn O

Further O
study O
is O
needed O
to O
investigate O
the O
origin O
and O
the O
route O
of O
the O
transmission. O
In O
cluster O
C82-II O
and O
cluster O
C82-III, O
the O
HCA O
strains O
and O
nosocomial O
strains O
showed O
the O
same O
PFGE O
profiles, O
suggesting O
the O
cross O
transmission O
of O
CRKP O
among O
HCA O
and O
nosocomial O
patients. O
CRKP O
strains O
could O
be O
introduced O
into O
the O
hospital, O
then O
spread O
within O
the O
institution O
and O
might O
cause O
nosocomial O
infections O
during O
the O
entry O
of O
HCA O
patients O
with O
CRKP O
infections, O
of O
which O
we O
should O
keep O
alert. O
Identical O

among O
HCA O
CRKP O
isolates O
implies O
the O
clonal O
spread O
of O
K. B-PATH

among O
HCA O
patients. O
It O
suggests O
the O
healthcare-associated O
transmission O
of O
CRKP O
strains O
in O
the O
local O
area. O
In O
addition, O
the O
same O
PFGE O
profiles O
were O
observed O
in O
strains O
carrying O
different O
resistance O
gene O
profiles, O
suggesting O
later O
acquisition O
of O
the O
resistance O
genes O
via O
horizontal O
transfer O
under O
antibiotic O
selection O
pressure. O
The O
main O
finding O
in O
the O
present O
study O
was O
that O
the O
antimicrobial O
resistance O
of O
HCA O
isolates O
was O
similar O
in O
severity O
to O
nosocomial O
isolates. O
This O
study O
was O
conducted O
at O
a O
tertiary O
hospital O
in O
Guangzhou O
city, O
Guangdong O
province, O
where O
more O
severe O
patients O
from O
all O
over O
the O
province O
or O
neighboring O
provinces O
had O
been O
hospitalized O
and O
approximately O
20% O
had O
been O
referred O
from O
other O
hospitals, O
which O
could O
explain O
the O
serious O
drug O
resistance O
in O
the O
HCA O
group O
in O
our O
study. O
Given O
distinct O
features O
of O
K. O

strains O
from O
different O
regions, O
more O
epidemiological O
data O
on O
nosocomial, O

are O
needed O
to O
better O
manage O

Conclusions O
HCA O
K. B-PATH

infections O
were O
similar O
to O
nosocomial O
infections O
regarding O
clinical O
features O
and O
antimicrobial O
resistance, O
and O
were O
different O
to O

CRKP O

were O
mainly O
prevalent O
in O
patients O

nosocomial O
infections, O
showing O
genetic O
diversity. O
Identical O
profiles O
observed O
in O
HCA O

nosocomial O
CRKP O

suggested O
the O
transmission O

and O
thus, O
not O
able O
to O

. O
We O
have O
previously O
described O
a O
micro-OCT O
that O
uses O
broadband O
light O
to O
produce O
images O
of O
the O
cornea O
with O
up O
to O
1–2 O
μm O
spatial O
resolution O
4 O
– O
6 O
. O
The O
micro-OCT O
was O
able O
to O
image O
corneal O
endothelial O
cells O
4 O
, O
5 O
with O
a O
much O
higher O
resolution O
compared O
to O
a O
spectral O
domain O
OCT O
7 O
. O
Corneal O
scarring O
secondary O
to O
various O
insults O
may O
cause O
permanent O
visual O
impairment, O
where O
corneal O
transplantation O
may O
be O
the O
only O
way O
to O
restore O
vision O
8 O
. O
As O
most O
corneal O
lesions O
or O
scars O
do O
not O
exist O
throughout O
the O
cornea, O
lamellar O
replacement O
of O
the O
diseased O
corneal O
layers O

, O
may O
provide O
better O
tectonic O
outcomes O
10 O
, O
or O
faster O
visual O
rehabilitation O
11 O
– O
13 O
. O
Thus, O
delineation O
of O
the O
cornea O
is O
important O
to O
allow O
for O
targeted O
treatment O
– O
while O
real-time O
AS-OCT O
guidance O
has O
now O
become O
possible O
in O
our O
surgical O
practice O
14 O
. O
However, O
current O
AS-OCT O
systems O
have O
limited O
resolution, O
which O
are O
only O
able O
to O
detect O
gross O
changes O
to O
the O
cornea O
without O
detailed O
imaging O
of O
corneal O
layers, O
especially O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
corneal O
scars O
or O
intrastromal O
lesions. O
Therefore, O
we O
performed O
a O
pilot O
study O
using O
a O
superluminescent O
diode O
array O
based O
micro-OCT O
system O
with O
~1 O
μm O
axial O
resolution O
to O
detect O
diseased O
corneal O
layers, O
i.e. O
even O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
corneal O
scarring. O
Here, O
we O
compared O
this O
in O
vivo O
micro-OCT O
to O
a O
commercially O
available O
AS-OCT O
system O
in O
an O
established O
animal O

to O
assess O
normal O

scarred O
corneas. O

The O
apparent O
lack O
of O
host–parasite O
co-evolution O
history O
just O
after O
hosts O
shifts O
(Woolhouse O
et O
al. O
2005 O
), O
may O
explain O
the O
much O
higher O
susceptibility O
of O
A. O
mellifera O
towards O
V. O
destructor O
and, O
as O
a O
result, O
the O
rapid O
decline O
of O
wild O
and O
feral O
European O
(-derived) O
honey O
bee O
populations O
globally O
since O
the O
spread O
of O
V. O
destructor O
began O
(Rosenkranz O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Villa O
et O
al. O
2008 O
; O
Kraus O
and O
Page O
1995 O
). O
Even O
though O
it O
is O
inevitable O
that O
natural O
selection O
would O
result O
in O
A. O
mellifera O
adapting O
to O
V. O
destructor O
if O
managed O
colonies O
were O
left O
untreated, O
this O
option O
was O
not O
considered O
in O
apiculture O
as O
the O
foreseen O
loss O
of O
colonies O
raised O
understandable O
concern O
over O
the O
sustainability O
of O
crop O
pollination O
and O
hence O
food O
security O
(Klein O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Aizen O
et O
al. O
2008 O
). O
Therefore, O
V. O
destructor O
has O
been O
permanently O
controlled O
in O
managed O
colonies, O
preventing O
coevolution O
processes O
(as O
predicted O
by O
Oldroyd O
1999 O
), O
leading O
to O
host O
resistance O
and O
tolerance O
or O
lowered O
virulence O
of O
the O
parasite, O
to O
take O
place O
(Neumann O
and O
Blacquière O
2017 O
; O
Brosi O
et O
al. O
2017 O
). O
There O
is O
clear O
evidence O
that O
wild O
populations O
of O
A. O
mellifera O
can O
survive O
V. O
destructor O
infestations O
by O
means O
of O
natural O
selection O
(Seeley O
2007 O
; O
Le O
Conte O
et O
al. O
2007 O
; O
Fries O
et O
al. O
2006 O
; O
see O
Locke O
2016 O
for O
a O
review). O
This O
also O
holds O
true O
for O
managed O
populations, O
which O
have O
not O
been O
treated O
against O
V. O
destructor O
(Oddie O
et O
al. O
2017 O
, O
2018 O
; O
Kruitwagen O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
Panziera O
et O
al. O
2017 O
; O
McMullan O
2018 O
). O
Therefore, O
sustainable O
beekeeping O
without O
the O
need O
to O
treat O
V. O
destructor O
is O
clearly O
feasible. O
Even O
though O
the O
mechanisms O
underpinning O
resistance O
to O
V. O
destructor O
infestation O
without O
treatment O
are O
not O
yet O
fully O
understood, O
we O
propose O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
Darwinian O
natural O
selection O
for O
adaptation O
of O
bees O
to O
this O
novel O
parasite O
as O
an O
integrated O
part O

other O

also O
acts O

Since O

[ O

exposure O

In O
conclusion, O
this O

further O
highlights O
the O
difficulty O
of O

Nonetheless, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O

are O
embryonic O
lethal O
while O
the O
Polr3a O

the O

that O

Furthermore, O
the O

During O
pregnancy, O
the O
source O
of O
plasmatic O
sHLA-G O
in O
mothers’ O
peripheral O
blood O
may O
come O
from O
the O
mother O
herself O
and/or O
from O
the O
fetal O
trophoblast O
cells. O
A O
child, O
a O
mother O
or O
both O
genetically O
committed O
to O
produce O
high O
levels O
of O
HLA-G O
could O
be O
more O
susceptible O
to O
infections. O
Therefore, O
the O
final O
sHLA-G O
production O
may O
be O
a O
combination O
of O
fetal–maternal O
HLA-G O
genotypes O
together O
with O
the O
micro-environmental O
factors O
that O
may O
modulate O
HLA-G O
expression O
43 O
. O
In O
this O
context, O
PM O
may O
influence O
both O
mother O
and O
fetus O
HLA-G O
production O
inducing O
the O
immunological O
consequences O
listed O
above. O
The O
increased O

susceptibility O
of O
infants O
born O
of O
mothers O
with O
a O
high O
level O
of O
sHLA-G O
at O
the O
first O
ANV O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
several O
nonexclusive O
mechanisms. O
Firstly, O
genetic O
variants O
of O
the O
infant O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
sHLA-G O
expression O
influence O
the O
level O
of O
sHLA-G O
in O
the O
mother O
during O
pregnancy O
(via O
trophoblast O
cells) O
and O
in O
the O
children O
during O
infancy O
43 O
. O
A O
high O
level O
of O
sHLA-G O
represents O
a O
tolerogenic O
environment O
from O
the O
infant’ O
immune O
system O
and O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
27 O
, O
28 O
. O
The O
correlation O
between O
the O
level O
of O
mothers’ O
sHLA-G O
during O
pregnancy O
and O
in O
the O
infant O
during O
the O
first O
2 O
years O
of O
life O
28 O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
these O
genetic O
factors. O
Secondly, O
high O
levels O
of O
sHLA-G O
observed O
at O
ANV1 O
are O
induced O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
pathogen O
(not O
necessarily O
malaria) O
escaping O
the O
mothers’ O
immune O
system O
and O
also O
represents O
a O
tolerogenic O
environment O
from O
the O
infant’s O
immune O
system. O
Infants O
exposed O
to O
infection O
during O
pregnancy, O
combined O
with O
a O
strong O
immune O
system O
regulation O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
mother, O
may O
develop O
an O
attenuated O
immune O
response O
towards O
pathogens. O

Introduction O
The O
use O
of O
physical O
or O
chemical O
means O
to O
remove, O
inactivate, O
pathogens O
on O
a O
surface O
or O
item O
to O
the O
point O
where O
they O
are O
no O
longer O
capable O
of O
transmitting O
infectious O
particles O
and O
the O
surface O
or O
item O
is O
rendered O
safe O
for O
handling, O
use, O
or O
disposal O
is O
termed O
as O
decontamination O
[ O
1 O
, O
2 O
]. O
Decontamination O
is O
the O
combination O
of O
processes, O
including O
cleaning, O
disinfection O
and/or O
sterilization, O
used O
to O
make O
a O
re-usable O
item O
safe O
for O
further O
use O
on O
patients O
[ O
2 O
– O
4 O
]. O
Cleaning O
is O
the O
act O
of O
removing O
visible O
organic O
residue O
(e.g. O
blood O
and O
tissue) O
and O
inorganic O
salts O
from O
patient O
care O
equipment O
and O
preparing O
it O
for O
safe O
handling O
and/or O
further O
decontamination. O
Cleaning O
also O
removes O
sufficient O
numbers O
of O
microorganisms O
to O
reduce O
risks O
for O
those O
who O
touch O
or O
handle O
the O
object O
[ O
3 O
, O
5 O
, O
6 O
]. O
In O
addition, O
it O
has O
been O
highlighted O
as O
a O
serious O
responsibility O
and O
a O
critical O
factor O
in O
the O
battle O
against O
HAIs O
[ O
7 O
]. O
Disinfection O
is O
thermal O
or O
chemical O
destruction O
of O
most O
pathogenic O
and O
other O
types O
of O
microorganisms, O
but O
not O
all O
bacterial O
spores O
[ O
3 O
, O
6 O
]. O
Whereas O
sterilization O
destroys O
all O
microorganisms O
(bacteria, O
viruses, O
fungi, O
and O
parasites) O
including O
bacterial O
endospores O
from O
inanimate O
objects O
by O
high-pressure O
steam O
(autoclave), O
dry O
heat O
(oven), O
chemical O
sterilants O
or O
radiation O
[ O
6 O
, O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
In O
this O
regard, O
strict O
compliance O
with O
the O
recommended O
decontamination O
process O
at O
all O
level O
is O
required O
[ O
9 O
– O
12 O
]. O
Since O
failure O
to O
properly O
disinfect O
or O
sterilize O
equipment O
carries O
not O
the O
only O
risk O
associated O
with O
a O
breach O
of O
host O
barriers O
but O
also O
the O
risk O
for O
person-to-person O
transmission O
(e.g., O
hepatitis O
B O
virus) O
and O
transmission O
of O
environmental O
pathogens O
(e.g., O
Pseudomonas B-PATH
aeruginosa) I-PATH
[ O
3 O
]. O
In O
Ethiopia, O
rigorous O
decontamination O
of O
reusable O
medical O
equipment O
is O
an O
important O
part O
of O
infection O
prevention O
and O
patient O
safety O
strategy O
[ O

]. O

Therefore, O
we O
performed O
a O
pilot O
study O
using O
a O
superluminescent O
diode O
array O
based O
micro-OCT O
system O
with O
~1 O
μm O
axial O
resolution O
to O
detect O
diseased O
corneal O
layers, O
i.e. O
even O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
corneal O
scarring. O
Here, O
we O
compared O
this O
in O
vivo O
micro-OCT O
to O
a O
commercially O
available O
AS-OCT O
system O
in O
an O
established O
animal O
model O
to O
assess O
normal O
and O
scarred O
corneas. O
Results O
The O
analysis O
was O
done O
across O
all O
corneal O
samples O
(10 O
control O
and O
10 O
injured). O
First, O
we O
compared O
normal O
corneal O
thickness O
measurements O
between O
established O
AS-OCT O
and O
micro-OCT O
to O
validate O
that O
the O
novel O
micro-OCT O
was O
comparable O
– O

. O
We O
found O
that O
the O
overall O
mean O
at O
baseline O
central O
corneal O

(CCT) O
was O
94.8 O
± O

using O
the O
AS-OCT O
and O
91.4 O

There O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O

measured O
under O
AS-OCT O

Oral O
metronidazole O
tablets O
are O
therefore O
often O
the O
preferred O
mode O
of O
administration, O
if O
tolerated. O
In O
this O
case, O
metronidazole O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
minimum O
inhibitory O
concentration O
of O
0.047 O
mg/L, O
approximately O
1/85th O
of O
the O
breakpoint O
concentration O
at O
which O
an O
organism O
is O
deemed O
metronidazole-sensitive, O
as O
per O
EUCAST O
guidelines O
current O
at O
the O
time O
of O
treatment O
[ O
36 O
]. O
This O
gave O
a O
good O
degree O
of O
confidence O
that O
metronidazole O
monotherapy O
would O
provide O
sufficient O
antimicrobial O
therapy. O
Although O
clindamycin O
was O
indicated O
as O
another O
possible O
therapy O
by O
sensitivity O
testing, O
it O
is O
not O
usual O
practice O
in O
the O
UK O
to O
use O
clindamycin O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
any O
bacterial O
endocarditis O
[ O
37 O
]. O
Furthermore, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
a O
prolonged O
course O
of O
clindamycin O
was O
potentially O
harmful O
due O
to O
the O
significant O
associated O
risk O
of O
Clostridium O
difficile O
infection O
[ O
38 O
]. O
This O
supported O
the O
decision O
to O
treat O
with O
oral O
metronidazole O
alone. O
In O
contrast O
to O
our O
case, O
the O
POET O
trial O
includes O
patients O
with O
endocarditis O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
heart O
caused O
by O
Streptococcus, O
Enterococcus B-PATH
faecalis, I-PATH
Staphylococcus B-PATH
aureus, I-PATH
or O
coagulase-negative O
Staphylococci O
[ O
4 O
]. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
this O
patient, O
blood O
cultures O
were O
positive O
for O
F. B-PATH
magna, I-PATH
an O
anaerobic O
organism. O
Infective O
endocarditis O
caused O
by O
anaerobic O
pathogens O
remains O
relatively O
uncommon, O
and O
accounts O
for O
only O
2–16% O
of O
all O
cases O
of O
infective O
endocarditis O
over O
the O
past O
four O
decades O
[ O
39 O
– O
42 O
]. O
The O
POET O
trial O
did O
not O
include O
patients O
in O
whom O
an O
anaerobic O
pathogen O
was O
the O
causative O
organism. O
This O
case O
has O
demonstrated O
that O
switching O
to O
oral O
antibiotic O
therapy O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
an O
anaerobic O
infective O
endocarditis O
could O
also O
be O
satisfactory, O
but O
further O
research O
is O
required O
to O
prove O
if O
this O
statement O
could O
be O
substantiated O
with O
clinical O
evidence. O

Note O
that O
although O
the O

The O

in O
terms O
of O
both O
the O

with O

In O
comparison O
with O
the O
recently O
analysed O
CLO/PXGs O
from O
the O
Viridiplantae O
[ O

], O
which O
are O
also O
quite O
variable, O
the O
fungal O
genes O
show O
even O
higher O
levels O
of O
variability. O
This O
heterogeneity O
of O
gene O
organisation O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
fungal O
CLO/PXGs O
being O
members O
of O
an O
ancient O
gene O

that O
has O
diverged O
considerably O
at O
the O
genome O
level O
while O
maintaining O
relatively O
conserved O

A O
rather O
unusual O
feature O
of O
the O
fungal O

sequences O
compared O
to O
those O

is O
the O
presence O
of O
significant O

just O
a O

are O
therefore O
classified O

Expression O

STAT-1 O

IFN-γ O
is O
known O

Here, O

In O
this O

one O
major O
source O
of O
IFN-γ O
could O
be O
the O

In O
addition, O
IL-1β O
is O
well O

with O
the O
development O

Expression O

with O
the O
cardiomyocyte O

detected O
at O
the O

(Figs O

It O
warrants O
further O
investigation O
whether O
the O
NLRP3 O
inflammasome O
is O
activated O
after O
disease O

in O
the O

Because O

no O
TNF-α O

activation O
in O
our O
orally O

cardiomyocytes O
at O

it O
is O
less O
likely O
that O
the O
apoptosis O
phenomenon O
here O
is O

pyroptosis O

. O
Altogether, O
oral O
infection O
with O
EV71 O
cloned O
virus O
F6 O
in O
this O
neonatal O
mouse O
model O
caused O
severe O
cardiomyocyte O
apoptosis O
and O
various O

mimicking O
human O
heart O
diseases. O
In O
contrast, O
i.p.-infected O

earlier O
(8 O

16 O
dpi) O
and O
presented O
only O
mild O
arrhythmia O
and O
moderate O
apoptosis O
at O
the O
moribund O
stage. O
We O
speculate O
that O
the O
cause O
of O
death O
of O
i.p.-infected O
mice O
is O
not O
related O
to O
cardiopulmonary O
collapse. O
Instead, O
one O
plausible O
cause O

could O
be O

The O
issues O
relating O
to O
sampling O
are O
not O
limited O
to O
(social) O
psychology, O
and O
similar O
concerns O
have O
been O
voiced O
in O
other O
related O
disciplines O
such O
as O
consumer O
research O
(Peterson O
2001 O
), O
education O
research O
(Usher O
2018 O
), O
behavioural O
economics O
(Levitt O
and O
List O
2007 O
) O
and O
business O
research O
(Bello O
et O
al. O
2009 O
). O
For O
example, O
Peterson O
( O
2001 O
) O
reviewed O
the O
literature O
in O
consumer O
research O
and O
found O
86% O
of O
the O
samples O
to O
be O
from O
students. O
Online O
Participants O
Perhaps O
in O
part O
as O
a O
response O
to O
these O
sorts O
of O
criticisms, O
(social) O
psychologists O
have O
increasingly O
turned O
to O
online O
platforms O
to O
recruit O
participants O
who O
are O
not O
students O
(e.g. O
Gosling O
et O
al. O
2004 O
; O
Gosling O
et O
al. O
2010 O
; O
Gosling O
and O
Johnson O
2010 O
). O
Over O
the O
past O
decade, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
strong O
increase O
in O
the O
use O
of O
participants O
crowdsourced O
via O
online O
platforms, O
such O
as O
Amazon O
MTurk O
or O
CrowdFlower O
(e.g. O
Buhrmester O
et O
al. O
2011 O
; O
Paolacci O
and O
Chandler O
2014 O
). O
Such O
expansion O
has O
benefited O
psychological O
research O
in O
many O
ways. O
For O
example, O
results O
from O
classic O
behavioural O
experiments O
(e.g. O
the O
Stroop O
Task; O
Stroop O
1935 O
) O
were O
shown O
to O
replicate O
well O
on O
these O
online O
platforms O
(Crump O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Even O
when O
studying O
political O
ideologies, O
it O
seems O
that O
MTurk O
is O
well-suited O
(Clifford O
et O
al. O
2015 O
). O
However, O
although O
Amazon O
boasts O
&gt; O
.5 O
million O
participants, O
the O
actual O
pools O
from O
which O
participants O
are O
sampled O
are O
much O
smaller, O
with O
the O
population O
estimated O
at O
around O
7300 O
individuals O
(Bohannon O
2016 O
). O
Moreover, O
while O
crowdsourcing O
platforms O
such O
as O
Amazon’s O
MTurk O
allow O
for O
sampling O
more O
diversely O
than O
typical O
student O
samples, O
for O
example O
with O
respect O
to O
age O
range, O
the O
participants O
remain O
predominantly O
WEIRD, O
with O
some O
notable O
exceptions O
(e.g. O
Raihani O
et O
al. O
2013 O
). O
Evolutionary O
Psychology O
as O
an O
Exception? O
Since O
its O
inception, O
evolutionary O
psychology O
has O
stressed O
the O
importance O
of O
human O
universals O
(e.g. O
Buss O
1989 O
, O
1994 O
, O
1995 O
; O
Cosmides O
and O
Tooby O
1997 O
; O
Tooby O
and O
Cosmides O
1990 O
). O

In O
recent O
decades, O
it O
has O
also O
been O
established O
that O
in O
many O
organisms O
cyt O
c O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
apoptosis O
[ O
8 O
, O
9 O
]. O
During O
apoptosis, O
cyt O
c O
is O
released O
from O
the O
mitochondria O
into O
the O
cytoplasm O
and O
binds O
to O
apoptosis O
protease-activating O
factor-1 O
(Apaf-1) O
thus O
triggering O
a O
caspase O
activation O
cascade O
[ O
8 O
]. O
For O
example, O
in O
humans, O
cyt O
c O
can O
activate O
caspase-3 O
in O
cell-free O
activation O
assay O
[ O
9 O
]. O
The O
first O
evidence O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
apoptosis O
in O
fungi O
came O
from O
the O
study O
by O
Medeo O
et O
al. O
of O
a O
Saccharomyces O
cerevisiae O
mutant O
that O
showed O
signs O
of O
apoptosis O
[ O
10 O
]. O
Since O
then, O
many O
homologous O
mammalian O
apoptotic O
proteins O
were O
discovered O
in O
budding O
yeast O
[ O
11 O
]. O
In O
an O
important O
finding, O
using O
deletion O
mutants O
which O
were O
unable O
to O
produce O
functional O
cyt O
c, O
Silva O
et O
al. O
presented O
the O
first O
evidence O
that O
cyt O
c O
is O
involved O
in O
hyperosmotic O
stress O
induced O
yeast O
apoptosis O
[ O
12 O
]. O
However, O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
role O
cyt O
c O
plays O
in O
apoptosis O
of O
filamentous O
fungi O
like O
R. O
arrhizus O
remains O
unknown. O
To O
characterize O
R. O
arrhizus O
cyt O
c, O
we O
cloned O
the O
gene O
for O
cyt O
c O
from O
R. O
arrhizus O
in O
E. O
coli. O
The O
purified O
cyt O
c O
was O
compared O
with O
two O
mammalian O
cyt O
c O
(horse O
and O
human). O
We O
selected O
R. O
arrhizus O
cyt O
c O
as O
a O
candidate O
for O
this O
study O
mainly O
for O
two O
reasons. O
First, O
this O
fungal O
cyt O
c O
is O
distantly O
related O
to O
mammalian O
cyt O
c O
and O
its O
biochemical O
properties O
are O
largely O
unknown. O
Secondly, O
R. O
arrhizus O
is O
a O
pathogenic O
fungus O
and O
any O
information O
gained O
on O
the O
pro-apoptotic O
activity O
of O
cyt O
c O
may O
also O
contribute O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
better O
therapeutic O
targets. O

The O
patient’s O
improving O
clinical O
condition, O
improving O
inflammatory O

and O
the O
achievement O
of O
source O
control O
through O

supported O
the O
decision O
to O
switch O
to O
oral O
therapy. O
The O
patient O
progressed O
well O
and O
was O
discharged O
on O
post-operative O
day O
13 O
to O
complete O
a O
total O
8-week O
course O
of O
oral O
metronidazole O
from O
the O
date O
of O

Discussion O
Finegoldia O
magna, O
previously O
known O
as O
Peptostreptococcus O
magnus O
[ O

], O
is O
a O
Gram-positive O
anaerobic O
coccus O
(GPAC), O
and O
like O
other O
GPACs O
is O
a O
common O
commensal O
of O
human O
skin, O
mucous O

and O
gastrointestinal O
and O
genitourinary O
tracts O
[ O
6 O
– O
8 O
]. O
Of O
the O
GPACs, O
F. O
magna O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
amongst O
the O
most O
pathogenic, O
and O
is O
a O
common O
isolate O
from O
skin O
and O
soft O

bone O
and O
joint O
infections, O
and O
diabetic O
foot O
infections O
[ O
7 O
, O
9 O
, O
10 O
]. O
Its O
particular O
virulence O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
product O
of O
a O
number O
of O
adaptations. O
Well O
described O
are: O
the O
expression O
of O
pili, O
which O
assist O
in O
adhesion O
and O
colonisation; O
the O
ability O
to O
bind O
to O
human O
albumin O
by O
way O
of O
a O
peptostreptococcal O
albumin-binding O
protein O
leading O
to O
accelerated O

rates; O
and O

B O
cells O
(the O
most O
common O
being O
Protein O

[ O
7 O
, O
11 O
, O
12 O
]. O
Whilst O
the O
infections O
above O
due O
to O
F. O
magna O
appear O
to O
be O
relatively O
common, O
confirmed O
infective O
endocarditis O
due O
to O
F. O
magna O
is O
notably O
more O
rare. O
A O
search O
of O
the O
English-language O

reveals O
eight O
previously O

cases O
of O

with O
F. B-PATH
