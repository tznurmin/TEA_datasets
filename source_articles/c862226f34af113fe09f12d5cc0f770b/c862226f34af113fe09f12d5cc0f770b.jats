This bacterium and the closely related bacterium, ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> Berkiella aquae’, have been assigned to the order <italic>Legionellales</italic> within the Gammaproteobacteria. They most closely resemble members of the genera <italic>Coxiella</italic> and <italic>Legionella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Both of these novel bacterial strains appear to invade the nuclei of their amoebal hosts. Bacterial invasion of the nucleus has been described for multiple protozoan species, most notably in the ciliate genus <italic>Paramecium</italic>, but also for flagellates and free-living amoebae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Such intranuclear invasion by bacterial symbionts can result in a range of host responses from a mutualistic or commensal association, as has been described for ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> Nucleicultrix amoebiphila’ and its <italic>Hartmanella</italic> spp. host, to a parasitic interaction as for <italic>Holospora</italic> spp. that develops a specialized infectious form ultimately lysing the <italic>Paramecium</italic> host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">While invasion of the protozoan nucleus has been reported for several groups of bacteria, including Verrucomicrobia, Chlamydia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria, invasion of mammalian cell nuclei has been limited to members of the Alphaproteobacteria, <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic>, and more recently the gram-negative Betaproteobacterium, <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Generally low frequencies of infection have been observed in cultured mammalian cells, although replication within nuclei has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For the Alphaproteobacteria and potentially <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, nuclear invasion may result from a propulsion into the nucleus via polymerized actin tails following the escape of bacteria from intracellular membrane compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Protozoan intranuclear symbionts may also rely on actin for nuclear invasion. Like <italic>Rickettsia</italic> spp. and <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, <italic>Holospora</italic> spp. also exit their <italic>Paramecium</italic> host phagosome and may utilize an 89 kD protein located at the tip of a large periplasmic space referred to as the “invasion tip.” This protein contains actin-binding motifs that influence actin-based motility of the bacterium, and actin tails have been observed to be associated with <italic>Holospora obtusa</italic> entering the host macronucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Bacteria that have escaped the phagosome might also move to the nucleus by associating with chromatin after breakdown of the nuclear membranes during mitosis and remain with it while the nuclear membranes are reformed following mitosis. This strategy has been described for <italic>Nucleicultrix amoebiphila</italic> in its amoebal hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Less information on nuclear entry is available for bacteria that do not first escape their cytoplasmic compartment. However, in <italic>Euglena hemichromata,</italic> it appears that bacteria-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles fuse with the outer nuclear membrane, releasing bacteria into the nuclear periplasmic space, which then subsequently invaginate the inner nuclear membrane for entry into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Despite the descriptions of intranuclear bacteria both in protozoan and mammalian cells, there have been few descriptions of bacteria that infect and replicate within the nuclei of multiple eukaryotic phyla. <italic>Rickettsia bellii</italic>, originally isolated from <italic>Dermacentor variabilis</italic> ticks, infects the nuclei of mammalian Vero and amphibian XTC-2 cells. <italic>R. bellii</italic> also survives within <italic>Acanthamoeba polyphaga</italic>, although nuclear invasion in the amoebae was not described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The present study is an examination of the recently described intracellular amoebal pathogen, ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis,’ with the nuclei of human cell lines and the entry of vacuoles containing this bacterium into the nuclei of host cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>‘<italic>Ca.</italic> Berkiella cookevillensis’ invades the nucleus of <italic>Acanthamoeba polyphaga</italic></title><p id="Par28">We have recently described an intracellular endosymbiont isolated from an amoeba, ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The bacterium was isolated from an amoeba found in a cooling tower, and is a coccoid bacterium of 1–3 μm diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. FISH was used to confirm the identity of the intracellular bacterium in <italic>A. polyphaga</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Because the unique sequences for ‘<italic>Ca</italic>. Berkiella cookevillensis’ were located in the class V and VI regions of the rRNA, which have low accessibility to in situ probes, helper probes were used to increase the signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. TEM shows that the endosymbiont is enclosed in a bacteria-containing vacuole (BCV) and appears to be within the euchromatin network of the nucleus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The bacteria are surrounded in the vacuole by electron-translucent space, which may indicate production of extracellular polysaccharide. Occasionally, bacteria were observed to be without an obvious surrounding vacuole or extracellular matrix (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b 24 h) indicating the potential for more than one mode of infection. TEM also confirms the gram-negative cell wall structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b 48 h inset). Evidence of dividing cells was observed for these intracellular bacteria, and increases in numbers of bacteria were also evident over a 48 h time period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1A). Bacterial-specific qPCR showed that bacteria increased by 1.5 log<sub>10</sub> over a 72 h period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). By 48 and 72 h p.i., greater than 90% of the amoebal cells had BCVs co-localized with amoeba nuclei (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1A). After 72 h, most host cells had lysed or were too fragile to stain properly. Observations of the bacteria, reveal that before 48 h, bacteria appear nonmotile (Additional file 2, part A), but by 48 h, a “jiggling” movement of bacteria within BCVs can be detected (Additional file 2, part B), which progresses to rapid, circular movement by 72 h (Additional file 2, part C). The bacteria remained motile in the infection buffer for several hours following host cell lysis, after which the bacterial cells became nonmotile and adhered to the bottom of culture flasks or plates, presumably facilitating their engulfment by grazing amoebae. The vacuolar electron-translucent space visible in TEMs suggests the presence of extracellular matrix material which might contribute to the biofilm-like arrangement of the bacteria adhering to the bottom of culture flasks. In all TEM sections of ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> Berkiella cookevillensis’-infected <italic>A. polyphaga</italic> we observed the intranuclear appearance of a BCV; however, given the two-dimensional nature of TEM sections, the possibility that these images depict the deep invagination of a BCV into the nuclear regions, as with a fist depressed into a slightly underinflated balloon, cannot be eliminated.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Growth of ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> Berkiella cookevillensis’ in <italic>Acanthamoeba polyphaga.

As with the amoebae, an electron-translucent space surrounds the individual cells with evidence of dividing cells and an increased number of bacteria by 48 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a-b). FISH confirmed the bacteria as ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ in both U937 and THP-1 human macrophage-like cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). A time course of infection in THP-1 cells using indirect immunofluorescent staining to detect ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ showed that by 6 h p.i., discrete puncta of bacteria could be detected in the cytoplasm, which by 12 h were perinuclear (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). By 24 h, larger inclusions of bacteria, indicative of replication, were perinuclear or co-localized with the nucleus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At 36–48 h p.i., large vacuoles of bacteria were either co-localized with nuclei or appeared to be within nuclei. The progressive increase in BCV size is indicative of bacterial replication within the vacuoles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 36–48 h). A confocal Z-stack of BacLight-stained bacteria in U937 cells also shows their location in the stained nucleus at 48 h p.i. (Additional file 3). Enumeration of U937 cells treated with ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ showed patterns of infection similar to those detected in THP-1 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) with 32% of cells infected and nearly 20% of cells having BCVs co-localized with nuclei at 24 h (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1B). Between 48 and 72 h p.i., infection levels in U937 cells increased from 39 to 55% with up to 42% of cells having BCVs co-localized with nuclei; however, there were no significant differences between cells with intracellular bacteria and cells with nuclear-associated vacuoles, indicating that by this time, almost all BCVs were nuclear localized (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1B). However, we also observed large cytoplasmic BCVs not associated with nucleus, suggesting that the nucleus is not a requisite for growth. After 72 h, significant cell lysis occurs so that very few intact host cells were detectable by 96 h p.i. Growth of ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ in macrophage-like cells resulted in a 1.25 log<sub>10</sub> increase over a 96-h period with the greatest increase occurring from 0 to 48 h p.i.

Similar to the macrophage-like cells, large cytoplasmic BCVs were also observed. By 96 h of infection, lysis of many of the HeLa cells had occurred. However, we did observe that the infected HeLa cells tended to persist longer in culture. This is likely due to the continued proliferation of HeLa cells, whereas differentiated THP-1 or U937 cells no longer proliferate. As a result, a more persistent infection occurred in the HeLa cells as new host cells were produced for the bacteria.

From observations of immunofluorescent stains and TEMs, we noticed repeatedly that the juxtanuclear inclusions of bacteria induce an indentation of the nuclear membranes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 48 h and Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, 24 h). To further investigate nuclear invasion by ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’, we performed indirect immunofluorescent staining with antibodies for nuclear lamin A/C. Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> depicts HeLa cells with both perinuclear and intranuclear inclusions of ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ at 24 h p.i. The juxtanuclear BCV and the indentation of the nuclear envelope (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>ai) suggest that the bacteria-rich vacuole applies a mechanical force or induces ruffling of the nuclear envelope. The HeLa cell in the 24 h view of Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> has lateral inclusions of bacteria as well as BCVs visible in the top view of the cell. Confocal imaging with lamin A/C staining (Additional file 4) shows that the BCV on the left side of the cell is invaginated into the nuclear area, as indicated by the ring of stained lamin that surrounds the bacteria, as would occur with the “fist in a balloon” scenario mentioned above. However, the BCV near the top right of the cell in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> (24 h; Additional file 4) is not encircled by nuclear lamina indicating its location within the nucleoplasm. Furthermore, it appears that the entire BCV is capable of entering the host nucleus through a break in the nuclear lamina (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>aii, Additional file 4). Breaks in the lamina can be detected only in areas where there is a juxtanuclear BCV. During and following entry of the vacuole into the nucleus, the nuclear lamina does not encapsulate the BCV nor does the vacuole acquire significant amount of the lamina as it does not stain positively for lamin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>aii and aiii). Since the nuclear lamina is tethered to the inner nuclear membrane, this suggests that the inner nuclear membrane does not associate with the BCV. Moreover, the bacteria are maintained within a vacuole through the entirety of the nuclear invasion process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>aii and aiii). Additionally, TEMs do not indicate more than a single membrane surrounding intranuclear BCVs (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Upon the successful nuclear infiltration of the BCV, the invasion-induced nuclear lamina lesion appears to be ameliorated and no protrusion or release of chromatin was detected at the site of nuclear entry (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>aiii). These observations indicate that the ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’-rich vacuole does not invade the nucleus via a method that causes general degradation of the nuclear envelope, but instead implies a regulated entry into the nucleus.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Lamin staining of ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> Berkiella cookevillensis’-treated HeLa cells.

To further analyze the nuclear lamina gap distance formed during the vacuole invasion, ZEN 2012 software was used to obtain a fluorescence profile across the lamina gap. The fluorescence profiles obtained for three examples demonstrate lamina gap distances of approximately 2000 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a), 2750 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b), and 4250 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c).

While we did not observe Rab5a-GFP associate with the BCV, the diffuse Rab5a-GFP throughout the cytoplasm provided an excellent cytoplasmic stain. Additionally, Rab5a-GFP does not passively diffuse through the nuclear pore complex, which often occurs with low molecular weight proteins like individual GFP molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Using the diffuse Rab5a-GFP as a cytoplasmic marker, we observed that cytoplasm was present between the nuclear envelope and BCV when the vacuole was pressing against the nuclear envelope (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). However, when the BCV was traversing the nuclear envelope, no diffuse Rab5a-GFP was identified between the bacteria-rich vacuole and the nucleus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b).

Furthermore, it indicates that the integrity of the nuclear envelope is maintained throughout the invasion process, suggesting a unique mechanism of entry not previously described for other intranuclear bacteria by which the bacteria pass through the nuclear envelope while enclosed in a membrane-bound vacuole.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Exclusion of cytoplasmic markers during ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> Berkiella cookevillensis’ nuclear invasion of HeLa cells.

Here we report ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ as a bacterium associated with the nuclei of mammalian cell lines, including human cells. The bacterium appears to enter nuclei of both phagocytic and nonphagocytic cell lines enclosed in a vacuole. In all host cell lines that we treated, which includes amoeba, as well as phagocytic and nonphagocytic human and murine cell lines, ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ replicates and appears to fill the nucleus, eventually lysing the host cell. Infection of the amoebal host typically resulted in 100% infection and co-localization with nuclei within 48 h, resulting in host cell lysis, whereas in human cell lines, nuclear association was not observed to be above 65%. In the human cell lines, we also observed increases in numbers of bacteria within cytoplasmic vacuoles, signifying that association with the nucleus was not necessary for bacterial replication in these cells. The intracellular association of bacteria and amoebae is thought to have led to the evolution of intracellular pathogens of humans and other vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and it is an interesting possibility that the differences between infectivity for amoebae and human cells could reflect an early stage of evolution for ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ as a human pathogen. ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ were commonly surrounded by a lucent space indicative of an extracellular matrix and were within an evident vacuole. However, occasionally bacteria that appeared to be intranuclear were not contained within a vacuole, and it is as yet unclear whether a membrane surrounds bacteria early in the infection process.</p><p id="Par41">Recent descriptions for nuclear invasion mechanisms include the escape from a phagosome by <italic>Holospora</italic> spp. and <italic>Nucleicultrix amoebiphila</italic> followed by either the use of a specialized actin-binding invasion tip or entry during nuclear envelope disintegration during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Another mechanism described for nuclear symbionts of <italic>Euglena</italic> is the fusion of the phagosome with the outer nuclear membrane in which the bacteria are released into the perinuclear space and subsequently invaginate the inner nuclear membrane to enter the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ appears to employ a mechanism that differs from those previously described. Although it is as yet unclear whether ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ escapes its initial phagosome and re-enters another membrane compartment within the cytoplasm, we typically observe bacteria enclosed within a membrane in TEMs and distinctly clustered bacteria in immunostaining. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy suggest that the bacteria traverse the nuclear envelope as an intact vacuole, providing evidence that ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ is able to enter the nucleus within a membrane vacuole. Furthermore, lamin staining indicates that a lamin-lined membrane has not formed around the bacteria as a result of a fusion-reforming event. Additionally, vacuoles appear to be pinched and elongated as they cross into the nucleus through breaks in the nuclear lamina (Figs. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b). These breaks do not result in the entry of other cytoplasmic contents into the nucleus nor the entry of detectable chromatin into the cytoplasm as has been reported during Parvovirus entry into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Although the TEM images depict ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ within a membrane in the nucleoplasm, the two-dimensionality of the images cannot exclude the possibility that the image represents a cross section of a cell in which the BCV is invaginated into the nucleus. Many of the confocal images also support an invagination or ruffling of the host nuclear envelope around the BCV. ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ possesses the genes for a type IV secretion system, and although type III secretion systems are most often associated with plasma membrane ruffling, the type IV secretion system of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> has been implicated in ruffling of the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Three scenarios might result from the ruffling and invagination of the nuclear envelope. In one scenario, both membranes are invaginated such that the BCV is surrounded by the nuclear envelope. In the second scenario, the BCV enters the perinuclear space through the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently invaginates only the inner nuclear membrane. Association of ‘Ca<italic>.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ with endoplasmic reticulum is currently being studied in our laboratory. ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ is related to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, which subverts endoplasmic reticulum membrane for its vacuole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Other bacteria, including <italic>Brucella</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> either fuse or interact with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. If the BCV was localized to the perinuclear space, then the BCV should be closely surrounded by the nuclear membranes and continuous with the nuclear envelope. While some examples of lamin protein immunostaining show the lamina around the BCV, other examples depict BCVs without any evident lamin staining (Figs. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>), seemingly indicating the lack of inner nuclear membrane surrounding the bacteria. Even if a very deep invagination were to obscure the continuity of the invaginated membrane with the nuclear envelope, the lack of lamin staining suggests the ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ vacuole is not surrounded by the inner nuclear membrane. Similarly, immunostaining of nuclear pore proteins does not suggest that nuclear envelope tightly surrounds the BCV (Additional file 6). TEM images indicate that a single membrane encloses the bacteria with chromatin evident between the BCV and the inner nuclear membrane (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). However, there is often a close association of the BCV membrane with the nuclear membranes, indicating a potential interaction between the BCV and nuclear envelope (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). A close proximity of the BCV to the nuclear envelope is also visible in the majority of confocal images and videos. This association may be the result of either a fusion or interaction of those membranes or a consequence of the limited intranuclear space for the replicating bacteria.</p><p id="Par118"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM5" xlink:title="Discussion"><media xlink:href="MediaObjects/12866_2019_1457_MOESM5_ESM.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="video-id">4DQeKMc2m65U12tiUgbbcZ</object-id><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Additional file 5:</bold> Confocal Z-stack video (mp4 file) of Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a with bacteria in HeLa cells stained with DAPI and anti-lamin A/C antibody, followed by the Z-stack with lamin immunostaining only.

The lack of both lamin and nuclear pore staining around the BCV suggests this as a possibility, although it should be noted that none of the three scenarios excludes the occurrence of the other two. Breaks in the lamina of the inner nuclear membrane are evident in Figs. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> (and Additional files 4 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>). Similar disruption of the nuclear envelope is implicated by nuclear pore staining (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S3). Nuclear envelope breakdown occurs during mitotic division. The association of the ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’-rich vacuole with nucleic acids following nuclear envelope disassembly during mitosis and subsequent reformation of the nuclear envelope upon completion of mitosis is an appealing mechanism for entry into the nucleus. However, the ability of these vacuoles to enter the nucleus in the terminally-differentiated U937 and THP-1 cells does not support the need for mitosis for intranuclear infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Many intranuclear viruses may also rely on the mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown for entry; however, other viruses are known to cross the nuclear envelope by mechanisms that do not rely on mitosis, such as entry through nuclear pore complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The 39 nm diameter size limit for translocation through the nuclear pore complex excludes these channels as a probable entry route for the ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ vacuole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; however, some viruses cross the nuclear envelope by inducing non-mitotic disruptions of the nuclear membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Parvovirues are small RNA viruses that enter the nucleus and although their entry is not well understood, recent evidence suggests that binding of viral capsids to nuclear pore complex proteins induces changes in calcium efflux that subsequently activate protein kinase C (PKC). PKC activation then activates cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2) which is further activated by caspase-3. These activation steps for PKC and CDK-2 are necessary for nuclear envelope disintegration during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Analysis of the ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] implicates several putative proteins with eukaryotic-like domains for PKC and CDK phosphorylation, as well as domains involved in caspase-3 activation and recruitment. As mentioned above, Parvovirus-induced breaks can result in leaking of components between compartments. The possibility that ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ entry into the nucleus, like viruses budding from the host cells, might subvert host ESCRT-III proteins to rapidly reseal the nuclear envelope after entry through bacterial-induced gaps also needs further exploration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The <italic>dot/icm</italic> genes of <italic>Legionella</italic> spp. and <italic>C. burnetii</italic> encode the components for a type IVB secretion system. ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ has 26 <italic>dot/icm</italic> genes with no homologous genes yet identified for <italic>icmT, icmN/dotK, icmM/dotJ, or icmX</italic>, although there are 7 hypothetical proteins in close proximity to the <italic>dot/icm</italic> gene cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Identification of ‘Ca.

We did not observe any such developmental changes in ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ in the vacuoles of their host cells. Zielinski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] also reported that as ‘Ca. E. bathymodioli’ fill the nucleus, loss of nuclear chromatin occurs suggesting the chromatin may serve as a nutrient source for the replicating bacteria. For ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’, as the BCV expands, TEM images suggest that chromatin is diminished (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), but the intravacuolar location of the bacteria may preclude them from utilizing chromatin directly. However, as similarly described for both ‘Ca. E. bathymodioli’ and <italic>N. amoebiphila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], we observed that as ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ fills the host cell, the host membranes disintegrate followed by release of the bacteria. Contrary to descriptions for the other intranuclear bacteria, before bacterial release from the cell, ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ begins to exhibit circular motility similar to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in cytoplasmic vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which increases over the next few hours before lysis, after which the bacteria remain motile for several hours following release. This motility is more pronounced in amoebae than in mammalian host cells. Whether this release from the host cell results from mechanical disruption of the membrane or effectors from the bacteria is as yet unknown.</p><p id="Par47">Nucleomodulins of bacteria have been described as a strategy for bacteria, particularly intracellular bacteria, to subvert the host processes by interfering with nuclear chromatin and proteins. Among these nucleomodulins are proteins with ankyrin repeats, a eukaryotic motif involved in protein-protein interactions. These protein motifs have been found in intracellular bacterial pathogens including <italic>Rickettsia</italic> spp. as well as <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>Legionella</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In the intracellular bacterium <italic>Ehrlichia chaffieensis</italic>, the anykyrin-repeat protein p200 binds to promoter regions in host cell DNA suggesting it may affect host cell transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ genome possesses several sequences encoding putative proteins with ankyrin-repeats, which could also be explored as potential effectors in the nucleus. Both <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> encode effectors that translocate to the nucleus. These effectors modulate histone and chromatin structure as well as affect transcription of genes involved in host defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. If a bacterium requires effector protein interaction with host nucleic acids, residing in the nucleus may provide the bacterium with greater accessibility to host chromatin.</p><p id="Par48">As noted by Schulz and Horn in their review of intranuclear bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], genomic comparisons, as well as transcriptomic and proteomic approaches will aid in understanding nuclear invasion mechanisms, although the obligate nature of this bacterium has thus far limited genetic studies. In all cell types treated with ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis,’ BCVs co-localize with the nucleus by 24 h p.i., often dotting the nucleus with multiple BCVs. We are currently characterizing the membranes that ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ acquires as it traffics to the nucleus, which will help to understand its nuclear association and entry, whether this bacterium enters host nuclei by deeply invaginating the nuclear envelope and surrounding itself with membranes or by enclosure in a membrane that remains intact as it traverses the nuclear envelope from the cytoplasm. Either association could be evolutionarily advantageous for a bacterium to evade degradation by a host cell. ‘Ca. B. cookevillensis’ thus may not only employ an as yet undescribed strategy to invade the host nucleus, but this bacterium is also without precedent in its ability to overtly use the nucleus as a growth niche, exhibiting high frequencies of infection and significant increases in numbers of bacteria within mammalian cell nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par49">The bacterium ‘<italic>Ca.</italic> B. cookevillensis’ associates with the nuclei of amoebal and mammalian host cells.

Replication of the bacteria in association with the nuclei results in host cell lysis.

Bacteria were added to host cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for amoebae and 10–200 for mammalian cells.
