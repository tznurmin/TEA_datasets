Chronic hyperglycemia, the most prominent feature of diabetes, direct the activation of intrarenal renin–angiotensin system (RAS), and increase production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to renal tissue injury and fibrosis (Urushihara and Kagami <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>; Murphy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1999</xref>; Singh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1999</xref>) .</p><p id="Par20">Angiotensin II (Ang II), a component of renin angiotensin system (RAS), mediate the development of diabetic nephropathy through various mechanisms (Ni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>; Onozato et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2002</xref>; Yadav et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>). Ang II could increase ROS production through activating reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOXs) enzyme (Ushio-Fukai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2009</xref>), resulting in a state of oxidative stress and altered redox signaling, manifested by damage to macromolecules, eventually lead to inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular dysfunction (Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2009</xref>; Weidinger and Kozlov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). Of the seven NOXs isoform, NOX4 is abundantly expressed in <italic>mesangial and tubular cells</italic> and is considered the major source of ROS production in renal cells in diabetes (Sedeek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Previous studies had shown that Ang II, ROS, and hyperglycemia could activate the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in different types of renal cells, including podocytes and mesangial cells (MCs) (Gorin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>; Lakshmanan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>; Teng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>). ERK plays a key role in the intracellular signaling pathway that integrates the transcription of genes involved in numerous cellular responses in DN (Ni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>; Cheng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>).

In the present study, we investigated the effect of valsartan on the prognosis of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes rat model, induced by single STZ injection (Wu and Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2015</xref>). The kidneys of diabetic non-treated rats developed advanced pathological changes that were implicated on the kidney function parameters. This diabetic group was characterized by a highly significant increase in proteinuria which considered as a major parameter for monitoring progression of DN, and attributed mainly to glomerular filtration barrier damage (Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">On the other hand, after 4 weeks of valsartan administration, it was evident that it restored the kidney function parameters to nearby normal levels compared to untreated group. In addition, these findings were confirmed by the histopathological study; it was noted that some histopathological changes were comparable to mild DN (class IIA) (Tervaert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>), manifested by minimal glomerular fibrosis, absence of interstitial fibrosis, nominal sclerosis, and minimal inflammation in treated diabetic rats renal tissues compared to advanced DN (class IV) in non-treated rats. Several studies reported such a beneficial effect of valsartan and other ARBs with different underlying molecular mechanisms. Wang et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2014</xref>) found that valsartan treatment was beneficial in protecting kidney injury in diabetes, including improvement of structural and functional changes and inhibition of fibrosis, inflammation, lipid accumulation, and ER stress in the kidney. Gao et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>) reported structural and functional improvement associated with inhibition of Notch pathway and Zhou et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>) related improvement to reduction in podocyte injury and renal NOX-mediated oxidative stress and inflammation. While Chen et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>) relate beneficial effects of irbesartan in DN to its ability to suppress RANKL/RANK and the downstream NF-<sub>k</sub>B pathway and for olmesartan, Lakshmanan et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>) reveal advantageous effect by modulating MAPK cascade and NOX2 with attenuation of oxidative stress (Lakshmanan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2014</xref>; Hartner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>; Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>; Gao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">In the present study, the molecular mechanisms mediated such effects could be due to the modulation of the activity of NOX4 and pERK in the renal tissues of treated rats; diabetic non-treated rats had significantly elevated NOX4 activity evidenced by a significant increase in the gene expression and the protein concentration, accompanied by high ROS production and high MDA level in renal tissues compared to control group. Surprisingly, valsartan administration maintains NOX4 activity and MDA level within their normal values.</p><p id="Par51">Previous studies confirmed that <italic>NOX4</italic> gene expression has been increased in diabetic rodent model animal, along with elevated MDA level and increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production with subsequent activation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways were previously observed in other studies and such effects were antagonized by NOX4 gene knock down by siRNA and GKT136901 <italic>NOX</italic> inhibitor (Sedeek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2013</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>; Ding et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>; Etoh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2003</xref>; Yaribeygi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2018</xref>). In addition, He et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>) found that ROS generation induced by high glucose concentration was mainly derived from NOX4 but not NOX1 or NOX2 in NRK-49f cells and animal model which was reversed by resveratol treatment (He et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">Jha et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>) showed that genetic deletion of <italic>NOX4</italic> prevent the development of glomerular injury via reduction of renal ROS in diabetic mice (Jha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>). In addition, in a study on podocyte-specific deletion of <italic>NOX4</italic>, it was found that <italic>NOX4</italic> deletion attenuated albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, mesangial expansion, and ECM protein deposition and decreased ROS production (Jha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>), illustrating the role of <italic>NOX4</italic> in the development of renal fibrosis.</p><p id="Par53">The ability of valsartan to restraint the expression of <italic>NOX4</italic> in renal tissues of type 1 diabetes rodent model was reported by Zhang et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>), in valsartan-treated group, which points to the role of Ang II receptor blockers in inhibiting <italic>NOX4</italic> expression in diabetic models. However, Zhou et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>) observed that valsartan treatment had no effect on the elevated <italic>NOX4</italic> expression in <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> mice and only reduce <italic>NOX2</italic> expression and activity. The reason for this discrepancy may be related to the different animal models used (Zhou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par54">In the present study, valsartan-treated rats develop significant reduction in blood glucose level compared to non-treated DN group. The hypoglycemic effect of valsartan was observed in other studies and could be attributed to increase glucose utilization in peripheral tissues, especially muscles, through upregulation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) (Guan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>; Chan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>), along with reduction in both hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis via reduce activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) via the downregulating effect of valsartan on NOX4-derived ROS and ERK1/2 (Winiarska et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>). Conversely, several studies reported that valsartan had no effect on blood glucose level in treated compared to non-treated group; one proposed explanation for the controversy regarding valsartan effect on blood glucose may be due to experimental changes to model used (Zhou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2014</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>; Gao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>; Sun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">Previous data declared that hyperglycemia could increase the expression of <italic>NOX4</italic> mRNA in both direct and indirect pathways. The direct effect is through activation of the NF-kB pathway, mediated by p62/PKζ interaction (Xi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>). The indirect effect achieved through induction of Ang II, that affect the mitochondrial K<sub>ATP</sub> channels thereby simulates the expression of mitochondrial Nox4, results in abrupt production of mitochondrial superoxide and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in renal tubular cells (Kim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>). Similarly, ERK pathway is considered as one of the redox signaling sensitive pathways that could be activated by ROS directly or via hyperglycemia (He et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>; Robinson and Cobb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1997</xref>; Fakhruddin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>; Manda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediate ligand-independent phosphorylation and activation of epidermal growth factor receptors, leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase (MAP3K), which results in ERK activation (Meves et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">Another possible mechanism for ERK activation by ROS may comprise the inactivation and degradation of the mitogen kinase phosphatase (MKPs) that keep the pathway in an inactive state (Kamata et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>). In addition, Choi et al., showed that hyperglycemia, through glutamate-induced oxidative stress, induces sustained activation of ERK pathway through a mechanism that involves degradation of MKP-1 (Choi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par57">It was previously reported that ERK1/2 was the main mediator of renal fibrosis, ECM deposition, inflammation, and proliferation in high glucose environment through regulation of TGF-B and SMAD pathways (Ni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>; Cheng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>; He et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>; Abe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2002</xref>), and has an important role in glomerular-endothelial-mesenchymal transition that characterizes DN (He et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>; Shang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">In the present study, the <italic>ERK1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mRNA expression as well as pERK1/2 protein concentration were significantly elevated in diabetic non-treated group compared to control.

Moreover, following valsartan administration, <italic>ERK1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mRNA expression and pERK1/2 protein concentration were significantly reduced, and such an effect was most likely mediated through Ang II blockage, NOX4-derived oxidative stress reduction, and the hypoglycemic effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par60">In conclusion, valsartan could protect the kidney from the deleterious effect of type 1 diabetes-associated nephropathy progression through decreasing oxidative stress, ERK1/2, and NOX4 activity.
