Although subdominant in the core intestinal microbiota and relatively harmless for healthy humans, under certain circumstances enterococci can cause infections such as bacteraemia, peritonitis, endocarditis, and urinary tract, wound, and device-related infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The successful survival of enterococci in the hospital environment can be attributed to multidrug resistance and pathogenic traits. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecium</italic> are the <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species most commonly associated with infection and vancomycin resistance. Enterococci are now ranked as the third most common type of nosocomial pathogen, with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> accounting for 60 to 80% of enterococcal infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Despite increasing epidemiological evidence that intestinal domination by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) precedes human bloodstream infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, it remains to be established whether <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> blooming upon antibiotic treatment leads to translocation and subsequent human bloodstream infection.</p><p id="Par3">Pioneering work using mouse models highlighted the effect of antibiotic treatments on enterococcal colonisation and translocation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Enterococcal translocation has since been reported after antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, coinfection, severe inflammatory conditions, severe burn injuries and acute irradiation, and after disruption of intestinal mucosal barrier function in various mouse genetic backgrounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Miyazaki <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> showed that mice after treatment with antimicrobial agents and cyclophosphamide displayed increased susceptibility to VRE bacteraemia, leading to death in one-third of the mice following oral VRE inoculation. Amongst the 13 mouse lines tested under these conditions, C57BL/6 mice were identified as the strain most susceptible to VRE infection after oral inoculation. However, whether higher susceptibility of C57BL/6 mice correlates with a higher translocation efficiency remains to be established. Enterococcal translocation has also been investigated in some studies combining deficiency of mucosal immunity and intestinal dysbiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice have been shown to display increased levels of bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes, with <italic>Enterococcus</italic> being the predominant genus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">This study aimed to examine the interrelationships between <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> overgrowth, spreading within the gut tissues and dissemination to extra-intestinal sites. Our previous studies, together with those of others, have shown that clindamycin treatment favours the overgrowth of enterococci in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract of CF-1 mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Here, we examined the overgrowth and translocation of indigenous enterococci in C57BL/6, CF-1 and CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice and that of an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> clinical isolate, VE14821, in clindamycin-treated C57BL/6 and CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. We also studied the passage of VE14821 from the lumen to the lamina propria in nonantibiotic-treated gnotobiotic mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clindamycin-treated C57BL/6 mice were more permissive for enterococcal translocation than CF-1 mice</title><p id="Par5">To evaluate the effect of clindamycin treatment on the levels of enterococcal translocation in C57BL/6 mice, we first assessed the induction of indigenous enterococcal overgrowth by clindamycin treatment in C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice, the two main substrains derived from the ancestral C57BL/6 mouse line. The levels of overgrowth in these substrains were then compared to the levels observed in CF-1 mice. The levels of viable enterococci in the contents of the lumens of the small intestine (cSi), caecum (cCA) and colon (cCO) were assessed by counting colony-forming units (CFUs). Untreated C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice were differentially colonised by indigenous enterococci. The median values of indigenous enterococci reached ∼5 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFUs/g of cSI, ∼10<sup>5</sup> CFUs/g of cCA and ∼10<sup>5</sup> CFUs/g of cCO in C57BL/6J mice and ∼10<sup>6</sup> CFUs/g of cSI, ∼10<sup>7</sup> CFUs/g of cCA and ∼10<sup>8</sup> CFUs/g of cCO in C57BL/6N mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). After three days of clindamycin treatment, the enterococcal population in the cSI, cCA and cCO of both C57BL/6 substrains increased, with the largest increase of ∼5-log being observed in the cCA and cCO of the C57BL/6J mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). As expected, enterococcal overgrowth occurred in the gut lumen of clindamycin-treated CF-1 mice (Supp. Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1A</xref>). The level of enterococci in the cCA and cCO after clindamycin treatment was ∼10 to 100 times lower in the CF-1 mice than in the C57BL/6 mice substrains. These results confirmed that clindamycin treatment led to enterococcal overgrowth in the gut lumen of both C57BL/6 substrains, and also indicated that the baseline levels of enterococci were higher in the C57BL/6N mice than in the CF-1 mice, at least in the lumen of the caecum and colon. Enterococcal spreading within the gut in the small intestine (SI), the caecum (CA) and the colon (CO), and dissemination to extra-intestinal sites in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), the mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT), the spleen (SP), the kidneys (KDs), the liver (LV) and the heart (HR) were then assessed in both C57BL/6 substrains and in CF-1 mice. In the absence of clindamycin treatment, no or very few enterococci were detected in the gut tissues, lymphoid organs or deeper tissues, suggesting either that the levels of translocation of the indigenous enterococci in untreated mice were very low or that the host immune system was highly efficient (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>, and Supp. Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1B,C</xref>). In contrast, upon clindamycin treatment, enterococci in the C57BL/6 substrains reached median levels of 10<sup>5</sup> CFUs in the SI, and 10<sup>6</sup> CFUs in the CA and CO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Enterococci reached lower levels of ∼10<sup>4</sup> CFUs in the SI and ∼5 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFUs in the CO of CF-1 mice (Supp. Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1B</xref>). Enterococcal translocation to extra-intestinal organs was detected in both C57BL/6 substrains, especially in the MAT and the LV, where levels reached 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> CFUs/organ and 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> CFUs/organ in the C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Translocation to the MLNs, SP, KDs and HR was barely detectable in the C57BL/6N mice, whereas median levels of ∼10<sup>3</sup> CFUs/organ or just above were observed for the MLNs, KDs and SP, and median levels of just over 10<sup>2</sup> CFUs/organ were observed for the HR in C57BL/6J mice. Although no statistically significant differences between the two substrains were observed under our conditions, these findings indicate that the levels of enterococcal translocation were higher in C57BL/6J than in C57BL/6N. Enterococci were detected in the MAT, LV and HR of clindamycin-treated CF-1 mice, with the LV being preferentially targeted (Supp. Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1C</xref>). Together, these data show that clindamycin-induced enterococcal overgrowth in the gut lumen led to higher levels of enterococcal translocation in the C57BL/6 mice than in the CF-1 mice.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effect of clindamycin on the levels of indigenous enterococci in the intestinal lumen and tissues, and translocation to organs in C57BL/6 mice.

Together, these data highlight the variability amongst <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> strains regarding efficiency of internalisation within colonic epithelial cells. Of the eight candidate strains, VE14821 demonstrated the most enhanced invasive properties in both colonic epithelial cell types. Using T84 cells in a two-chamber transcytosis system, the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) through the cell monolayer was measured to evaluate monolayer integrity. The ability of VE14821 to cross the monolayer was compared with that of VE14518, OG1RF and JH2-2. Eight hours after infection, TEER was similar in the uninfected control monolayer and in the infected cells, regardless of the strain being used. These findings show that infection did not alter the integrity of the monolayer and suggest that the translocation involved a transcellular mechanism (Supp. Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2B</xref>, left panel). The level of translocated bacteria recovered from the lower chamber indicated that all strains translocated across the cell monolayer with equal efficiency (Supp. Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2B</xref>, right panel). These results show that, in addition to its propensity to invade colonic epithelial cells, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> VE14821 was also able to cross a cell monolayer.

Enterococcal counts were analysed 13 hours after inoculation. As observed with the indigenous enterococci, VE14821<sub>cm</sub> was mainly located in the distal regions of the gut lumen in each of the mice strains, with overgrowth levels of ∼10<sup>8</sup> CFUs/g of cCA and cCO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). VE14821<sub>cm</sub> was found within the gut tissues at a median level of ∼10<sup>3</sup> CFUs in the SI, ∼10<sup>5</sup> CFUs in the CA and ∼10<sup>4</sup> CFUs in the CO of CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice; levels were 10-times higher than those observed in the corresponding gut tissues from the C57BL/6 mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Although only low levels of VE14821<sub>cm</sub> translocation to the deeper organs were observed all three types of mice, levels of translocation of VE14821<sub>cm</sub> to the LV tended to be higher in the CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice than in the C57BL/6 substrains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). No significant differences in the levels of total indigenous enterococci were observed between C57BL/6J, C57BL/6N and CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, in either the absence or presence of VE14821<sub>cm</sub>, indicating that VE14821<sub>cm</sub> affects neither the colonisation nor the translocation of indigenous enterococci (Mann-Whitney’s test; data not shown). VE14821<sub>cm</sub> counts were lower than those for total enterococci in the lumen and the gut tissues of C57BL/6 mice, indicating that VE14821<sub>cm</sub> did not compete with indigenous enterococci in the C57BL/6 substrains. Similar results were observed for the gut lumen in CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice.

In agreement with the well-established role of the microbiota in colonisation resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, this level was 10 to 1000-fold higher than that observed in conventional C57BL/6J mice. VE14821<sub>GFP</sub> was localised by immunohistological examination of the colonic section, using classic double labelling of the claudin-1 tight junction protein and the nuclei to differentiate between mucosae from the submucosa and muscularis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>).

The course of these events was then examined at higher magnification by transmission electron microscopy of the same colonic samples, and of sections from the SI and the CA.

However, the low efficiency of enterococcal translocation in mice in the absence of intensive treatments has not allowed studies to take full advantage of this model to decipher the mechanisms involved in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> pathogenesis originating from the gut. Here, we quantitatively assessed the relationship between clindamycin-induced overgrowth and translocation. Overgrowth led to spreading of enterococci in the CA and CO – with ∼10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> CFUs per tissue – and then to subsequent dissemination to peripheral organs, especially to the MAT and LV to levels of ∼10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> CFUs in C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice exhibited the highest level of enterococci in the gut lumen after clindamycin-treatment and were more permissive to enterococcal translocation than CF-1 and CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. These results definitively established the higher susceptibility of C57BL/6 mice to enterococci, strengthening previous data obtained by Miyazaki and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Our findings show that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> translocation is only triggered once a threshold of overgrowth has been reached, rather than gradual translocation occurring conjointly with overgrowth in the lumen. In keeping with this conclusion, Chakraborty <italic>et al</italic>. recently reported that intestinal proliferation is required for translocation of enterococci upon ceftriaxone treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Epidemiological studies have also reported an association between VRE intestinal domination and bloodstream infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The results of these previous studies, taken together with our finding support that enterococcal overgrowth may increase the risk for subsequent infection.</p><p id="Par12">The CX3CR1 receptor and CX3CR1-expressing cells are involved in regulating bacterial translocation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Steady state levels of bacterial translocation have been found to be high in CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, with <italic>Enterococcus</italic> being the predominant genus translocating to the MLNs, suggesting a role for CX3CR1-expressing cells in restricting translocation of bacteria from the microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Conversely, CX3CR1<sup>hi</sup> cells have been shown to carry out trafficking of non invasive bacteria to the MLNs during antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, and this migration was found to be tightly regulated by the microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In antibiotic-treated mice, translocation of commensal bacteria – including that of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> – occurs through colonic goblet cell-associated antigen passages or GAPs; however, this pathway has been shown to be abolished in the absence of CX3CR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Taking into account the important role played by CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> cells in transporting commensal bacteria to the MLNs, our findings suggest that abolition of CX3CR1 expression restricts the level of enterococci in the gut lumen, thereby limiting <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> translocation to extra-intestinal sites after antibiotic therapy.</p><p id="Par13">We found that the clinical isolate VE14821 was able to colonise the gut lumen and enter into the intestinal tissue of both C57BL6 and CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. In the CX3CR1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, VE14821 competed with indigenous enterococci in the gut tissues. However, translocation of VE14821 was inefficient, as the optimal threshold of enterococci in the intestinal lumen had not been reached. VE14821 is a strain of human origin and may not be as well-adapted to the murine gut as the indigenous enterococci, which could have delayed or limited VE14821 overgrowth. Our in-depth analysis of the gut tissues of VE14821-inoculated gnotobiotic C57BL/6 mice provided clear evidence of the passage of VE14821 from the lumen and its internalisation in the epithelial cells before reaching the lamina propria. Once at the lamina propria, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> was found in a free state outside cells in the extracellular matrix, a finding consistent with reports indicating that enterococci have the ability to bind extracellular matrix proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Remarkably, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> was also found intracellularly in a free state in the cytosol, supporting findings from previous studies indicating that bacteria are able to hijack lysosomal degradation pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

Further statistical analysis or post-hoc comparisons were done using the Tukey test and the GraphPad Prism software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>T84 translocation assay</title><p id="Par21">Translocation experiments were performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Briefly, T84 cells were seeded in a 12-well Transwell system with 3 μm-pore size polycarbonate membranes (Corning). Formation and integrity of the cell monolayer was monitored by measuring the TEER with the Millicell® Electrical Resistance System (ERS-2, Millipore). Translocation assays were performed when the TEER was stable and had reached 1500 Ω or higher, which usually occurred within 14 days. The day before the experiment, the cells were washed and fresh medium was added. Cells were then infected by adding the bacteria to the upper chamber (8 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFUs in 50 μl). Viable bacteria in the lower chamber were counted at four and eight hours post-infection after serial dilutions of an aliquot were transferred to BHI agar plates. Experiments were performed in duplicate wells for at least four independent assays. The difference in TEER between the infected cells and an uninfected control was analysed using the unpaired Student’s t-test. Differences in the levels of translocation between the strains were tested by a non-parametric one-way ANOVA using the GraphPad Prism software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Histology and immunostaining</title><p id="Par22">Flushed intestines were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated and then embedded in paraffin. Slide-mounted sections were prepared with a rotary microtome. Immunostaining was performed according to standard protocols. The sections were deparaffinised in xylene and rehydrated using a descending alcohol series. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the sections in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.5, in a heated water bath at 97 °C for 40 min. Following a further one-hour incubation at room temperature in 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS, the sections were transferred to a blocking solution (BSA 1% in PBS buffer). Anti-GFP antibodies were used to reduce green autofluorescence emitted from the tissue and allow detection of GFP-expressing VE14821. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: mouse anti-claudin 1 (Invitrogen, diluted 1:100) and rabbit anti-GFP (Roche, diluted 1:200). Fluorescence-labelled anti-mouse DyLight 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, diluted 1:500) and anti-rabbit A568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, diluted 1:2000) were used as secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Sections were scanned with a digital slide scanner (Pannoramic Scan 3DHistech).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p id="Par23">All samples were treated using a protocol similar to that described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Briefly, individual intestinal segments from the SI, CA and CO were ligatured on both sides. Fixation was performed by injecting within the closed segment a 1:1 mix of 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M Na cacodylate buffer, pH 7.5, followed by incubation for 3 h at room temperature. Thin sections (70 nm) were collected onto 200 mesh cooper grids, and counterstained with lead citrate. Grids were examined with Hitachi HT7700 electron microscope operated at 80 kV (Elexience – France), and images were acquired with a charge-coupled device camera (AMT). Microscopic observations were performed on samples from two independent experiments, each performed on one mouse.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank A.
