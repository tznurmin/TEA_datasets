id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">It has been widely accepted that inflammation is central to the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). This disorder of glucose control in diabetics can cause inflammation and cellular stress, causing functional deterioration seen in DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Studies have shown that macrophage polarization occurs in renal inflammation and plays a decisive part in DN, and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators by macrophages after activation contributes to deterioration of DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Macrophages are subdivided into two subpopulations: the classically-activated or M1 phenotype macrophages and the alternatively-activated or M2 macrophages. M1 phenotype macrophages are observed to deliver higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines to deal with infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Macrophages can re-programme their metabolism and differentiate into pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Inflammatory macrophage activation involves metabolic adaptation towards glycolysis, videlicet, M1 macrophages mainly utilize glycolysis to provide energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) is a specific protein that interacts with transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). TAB1/TAK1 can activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in high glucose (HG)-induced BMMs, regulating macrophage activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Studies suggest that activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway upregulates HIF-1α activity and enhances glycolytic metabolism in an autonomous fashion, HIF-1α may be considered as a novel therapeutic target for DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. HIF-1α has been reported to be closely involved in energy metabolism and it increases the activity of glycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase-1 (HK1), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, TAB1 may be involved in macrophage glycolysis and activation through NF-κB/HIF-1α, which is a principal link in the genesis and evolution of DN.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we used siRNA and lentiviral vector technology to knock down TAB1 in HG-induced macrophages and STZ-induced diabetic mice, then evaluated glycolysis, polarization of macrophages and levels of inflammation, thereby exploring the relationship between the TAB1/NF-κB/HIF-1α signaling pathway and glycolysis in polarization of macrophages in the DN microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials and reagents</title><p id="Par8">The following materials and reagents were used in this study: mouse fibroblast cell line (L-929) was obtained from the cell bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; lipofectamine RNA iMAX transfection and Trizol reagent were obtained from Thermo Scientific (USA); HiScript II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR and AceQ qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix were obtained from Vazyme (Vazyme, Nanjing, China); A3500 Reverse Transcription System was obtained from Promega (Promega, Madison, USA); FITC anti-mouse F4/80, APC anti-mouse/human CD11b, FITC rat IgG2a κ isotype control and APC rat IgG2a κ isotype control were obtained from BioLegend (San Diego, California, USA); iNOS Monoclonal Antibody (CXNFT), APC were from eBioscience™ from Thermo Fisher Scientific (USA), anti-NF-κB p65 antibody and anti-NF-κB p65 antibody(ChIP) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA); anti HIF-1α, anti-HK1, anti-TAB1 and anti-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were obtained from Abcam Biotechnology (Cambridge, UK); anti-PFKFB3, anti-LDHA and anti-P-P65 were from Wuhan Sanying Biotechnology Inc (Sanying, Wuhan, China); anti-CD68 and anti-TNF-α were from Arigo Biolaboratories Corp (Arigo, Taiwan, China); anti-IL-1β from ABclonal Technology (Wuhan, China) and ELISA kits for mouse IL-1β, MCP-1 and TNF-α were obtained from R&amp;D (USA) and MULTI SCIENCES(Hangzhou, China).

Increasingly, research has suggested that inflammation is a critical factor activated by metabolic, hyperglycaemic, AGEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and haemodynamic derangements. Macrophages may be pivotal to this process and unexplained inflammatory cells are known to mediate kidney inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Research has shown that macrophage infiltration is closely involved in regulation of serum creatinine, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Macrophages have two major subtypes: the M1 macrophage (or classically activated) is involved in inflammation by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to pathogens or other immune stimuli (including but not limited to DN). Conversely, the M2 macrophage exhibits anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In vivo, M1 macrophage polarization and proinflammatory cytokine expression increase, and M2 macrophage polarization and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression decrease in DN mice. The imbalance of M1/M2 macrophages reflects the pathogenesis of DN. In vitro, DN microenvironmental products, such as high glucose and AGEs tend to differentiate macrophages into the M1 phenotype, secreting more iNOS and pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α and MCP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our study suggests that expression of iNOS in HG-induced BMMs is markedly enhanced. The mRNA expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines MCP-1 and IL-1β, were significantly elevated in the HG group. The result that HG induces polarization of BMMs towards the M1 phenotype is consistent with recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, we found that TAB1-siRNA can suppress the polarization and inflammation caused by HG—levels of INOS, MCP-1 and IL-1β in macrophages under high glucose were inhibited by TAB1 siRNA. CD68 is used as a valuable cytochemical marker for immunostaining monocytes/macrophages in histochemical analysis of inflammation of tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our in vivo results showed that CD68 and iNOS were overexpressed in the kidney after STZ treatment of mice. Inhibition of TAB1 by lentivirus lead to a reduction in infiltration and activation of M1 macrophages. In addition, TAB1 lentivirus markedly attenuated the upregulation of IL-1β and TNF-α induced by STZ. Additionally, the results of our study indicated that TAB1 lentivirus noticeably prevented the progression of DN—TAB1 lentivirus reduced the albuminuria excretion, tubulointerstitial damage index and glomerular mesangial expansion index in diabetic mice. These results indicate that TAB1 regulates the occurrence of macrophage polarization and inflammation, improving DN. However, the mechanisms behind this remain unclear.</p><p id="Par41">It has been reported that many cancers have an altered metabolism, called the Warburg effect. These reports propose a neoteric form of metabolism. Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose through glycolysis, thereby producing lactic acid as an end product without using oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Under this transformation, tumor cells survive with optimized utilization of glucose. Increasing evidence suggests that the Warburg effect occurs in other situations. Activated inflammatory immune cells also exhibit metabolic features similar to glycoclastic cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. M1 macrophage, which have a high energy demand, obtain energy from glycolysis to apidly provide ATP to promote inflammation. So macrophages activated by pro-inflammatory factors switch towards glycolysis, ignoring oxygen. For example, as a classical activator of M1 phenotype macrophages, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been reported to be involved in metabolic reprogramming of macrophages through increasing translation of HIF-1α mRNA, increasing expression of u-phosphofructokinase2 and inhibiting expression of Adenosine 5‘-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase, which contribute to macrophage glycolysis. Conversely, M2 phenotype macrophages appear to be more inclined towards oxidative phosphorylation—numerous processes that activate the glycolytic process in pro-inflammatory macrophages are decreased in M2 macrophages, which increasingly flux through OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, imbalance in glycolytic metabolites, such as succinate and lactate, can also interferes with inflammatory phenotypes via activating signalling pathways, post-translational mechanisms, epigenetic landscape and pos-transcriptionally regulate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As the rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, PFKFB3, HK1 and LDHA play a critical role in glycolysis and are over-expressed in glycoclastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Recent studies report that M1 macrophages express high levels of glycolytic enzymes and that HK1 regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which subsequently regulates the production of IL-1β. PFKFB3 participates in the anti-viral response of macrophages. Current research also suggests that LDHA may be a key metabolic enzyme involved in regulation of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Glycolysis promote the inflammation through multiple mechanism, metabolic reprogramming of macrophages promises to be a new target for macrophage-mediated inflammatory diseases. In our study, lactic acid production and glucose absorption test results showed that lactate production and glucose uptake in the HG group were significantly higher when compared with the control group. Compared with the HG group, lactic acid production and glucose absorption capacity of the TAB1 siRNA + HG group were decreased, and this difference was statistically significant. In the HG group, we also observed stronger staining for HK1, PFKFB3 and LDHA when compared with controls, and HG-induced BMMs treated with TAB1 siRNA showed a reduction in HK1, PFKFB3 and LDHA staining. Results of Western blots and RT-PCR also showed the same trend. The protein levels and mRNA of glycolytic enzymes HK1, PFKFB3 and LDHA in HG-induced BMMs were distinctly higher than the levels in the control group. In the TAB1 siRNA + HG group, they were significantly weaker than those in the HG group, which proved that the glycolysis of HG-induced M1 macrophages was enhanced and expression of glycolytic enzymes HK1, PFKFB3 and LDHA were up-regulated in an HG environment. TAB1 silencing inhibited the enhancement of glycolysis under HG conditions. Similarly, in vivo, immunohistochemical and Western blotting demonstrated that STZ-induced diabetic mouse kidneys showed higher levels of HK1, PFKFB3 and LDHA, and these STZ-induced glycolytic enzymes were notably inhibited by TAB1 lentivirus. Focusing on macrophages in renal tissue, immunohistochemical double-staining revealed that TAB1 inhibition decreased STZ-induced glycolysis of renal macrophages. Therefore, Macrophages enhance glycolysis upon activation by glucose dysregulation, and silencing of TAB1 inhibits macrophage glycolysis while reducing inflammation in vivo and in vitro.</p><p id="Par42">NF-κB is a recognized downstream signaling target molecule of TAB1/TAK1. After Toll-like receptor signal transduction, TAK1/TAB1 mediates NF-κB p65 nuclear entry through IKKα/β, inducing further inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Emerging evidence points to NF-κB control over the HIF signaling pathway and interaction between the HIF signaling pathway and the NF-κB signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has been confirmed that NF-κB controls HIF-1α transcription in macrophages activated by LPS through ChIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. High expression of specific transcription factors, principally HIF-1α, NF-κB and Octamer Binding Transcription Factor 1, contribute to the Warburg effect. In other words, HIF-1α is involved in regulating the energy metabolism of cells and makes cells more inclined to utilize glucose through glycolysis. Simultaneously, studies have shown that patients with DN have higher HIF-1α levels and sodium-dependent glucose transporters 2 inhibitors, recently used to treat DN, also target HIF-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the classical inflammatory cells, HIF-1α is involved in glycolysis and has a role in inflammation. But whether HIF-1α can be driven by high glucose via NF-κB has not been studied in depth. Therefore, it is worth exploring thoroughly whether TAB1 regulates macrophage glycolysis through TAB1/NF-κB/HIF-1α and mediate inflammation in M1 phenotype macrophage. In our study, we observed that the green fluorescence of NF-κB p65 in the control group was mainly located in the cytoplasmic region. In the HG group, the fluorescent of NF-κB p65 was mostly found in the nuclear region, and treatment with TAB1 siRNA significantly inhibited the presence of green fluorescence in the nucleus. Western blotting revealed that the levels of TAB1, NF-κB p65 and HIF-1α were increased significantly in the HG group. In the TAB1 siRNA + HG group, TAB1, NF-κB and HIF-1α protein expression both decreased, in contrast to the HG group. In vivo, the expression of TAB1, p-p65 and HIF-1α were measured in mouse kidneys. Western blot results showed that although the protein level of p65 remained unchanged, the expression of p-p65 was increased in STZ-induced diabetic mice, while TAB1 lentivirus decreased its expression significantly—this is consistent with the results of P65 nuclear expression in vitro. The same is true of the expression trends for TAB1 and HIF-1α. Results from ChIP showed specific binding of NF-κB to HIF-1α in HG-induced macrophages, confirming the potency of TAB1/NF-κB regulating HIF-1α. The above results suggest that TAB1 is involved in the regulation of NF-KB and HIF-1α to a certain extent, and this may be closely related to glycolysis and activation of macrophages.</p><p id="Par43">At present, new developments in the treatment of DN include treatment options such as MCP-1 inhibitors that inhibit macrophages and inflammation, but more precise treatment targets are still urgently needed. Our study demonstrates that glucose dysregulation can initiate macrophage glycolysis and M1 polarization, causing the release of inflammatory factors. These effects are closely related to aggravation of DN. Downregulation of TAB1 signaling reverses glycolysis and M1 polarization of macrophages, reducing inflammation, improving the clinical and pathological manifestations of DN. In summary, our study proposes that the TAB1/NF-κB/HIF-1α signaling pathway mediates the glycolysis and polarization of macrophages to promote inflammation in DN.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.81600568; No. 81770722).
