id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Transposable elements, or transposons, are DNA elements vertically transmitted in eukaryotes, from parents to offspring and ancestral to descendant species. In some cases however, a transposon might be horizontally transferred between different species, that is, transferred between species by other means than vertical transfer. BovB (Bovine-B), a non-LTR retrotransposable element present in ruminants and squamates, has been extensively studied as the first case of a horizontal transfer of a retrotransposable element between eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recently, two other cases of horizontal transfers of non-LTR elements have been reported: AviRTE has been detected in birds and human parasitic filarial nematodes including the eye worm <italic>Loa loa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and LINE-1 has possibly been transferred between marine eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that transposons survive longer if they escape host silencing mechanisms through horizontal transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the mechanisms of HTTs are still unclear, they could be facilitated by parasites and pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Parasites have long lasting, physical contact to their hosts, which increases the chances of HTT either directly or through a secondary pathogen. There have been numerous reports of HTT between parasites and their hosts. In nematodes, in addition to the previously mentioned AviRTE, the DNA transposon <italic>bandit</italic> has possibly transferred between hookworms and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In ectoparasites, ticks are the likely intermediate for the spread of BovB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], but the bed bug (<italic>Cimex lectularius</italic>) and the leech (<italic>Helobdella robusta</italic>) have also been indicated as potential vectors of BovB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The kissing bug (<italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic>), blood feeder and vector of Chagas’ disease, harbors multiple horizontally transferred transposons: DNA transposons SPIN and OC1 share over 95% consensus sequence identity between the kissing bug and its hosts, opossums and squirrel monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>After being horizontally transferred, transposons can have significant impacts on the recipient organisms. They can proliferate in the host genome and increase the genome size significantly. The genome of the strawberry poison frog (<italic>Oophaga pumilio</italic>) is 6.76 Gb large, 4.76 Gb of which are repetitive elements. These include transposons which continued to proliferate after horizontal transfer from other species, possibly lizard and fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Transposons and their intra-genomic movement can lead to changes in a species’ genotype and phenotype (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). Transfers of transposons between species have been shown to support the creation of new genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In tomatoes, insertion of a retrotransposon called Rider into the PSY1 gene leads to a yellow phenotype of the fruit, while duplication of the SUN gene mediated by Rider leads to the elongated fruit shape of Roma tomatoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Rider was horizontally transferred between the lineages of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato plants.</p><p>It is important to distinguish horizontal transfer from contamination of genetic material for example during sample collection. This is not a simple task but necessary if we are to understand if and how frequent horizontal transfers occur, and what the involved species are. Contamination has been previously erroneously identified as horizontal transfer in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The close physical and molecular association between a parasite and its host makes determining horizontal transfer a great challenge. We developed a new approach to distinguish between contamination and horizontal transfer that is similar in concept to existing methods. A common strategy to test for contamination is to examine flanking regions of transposon insertions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. If the flanking region does not originate from the organism, the transposon is also considered as contamination. Another strategy is to compare the coverage of sequence reads at the transposon and in flanking regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To remove the factor of genome assembly issues that arise with repetitive regions, we devised a simple strategy to directly determine contamination at the read level. In contrast to genome assemblies, read pairs and long reads are derived from a contiguous strand of DNA. Our approach takes reads that code for an RTE, and identifies the origin of the non-repetitive part of the read pairs or long reads (see Methods).</p><p>Given the previously documented horizontal transfers of BovB and AviRTE, the question arises whether RTEs are prone to horizontal transfer between parasites and hosts. We investigated RTEs in 33 mammalian and 10 nematode - free-living and parasitic - species, to identify potential horizontal transfers. We found RTE1_Sar from <italic>S. araneus</italic> and BovB from ruminants in parasitic nematodes, and with subsequent analysis confirmed RTE1_Sar as the only HTT case. BovB has been analyzed previously in multiple studies, but is has not been reported in nematodes: in fact, Ivancevic and colleagues reported BovB explicitly as absent in 12 nematode species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This raised the question of whether the finding of RTE1_Sar in <italic>S. araneus</italic> and BovB in several nematodes resulted from misassemblies due to contamination from/to endoparasites. We developed a simple approach to test for contamination based on long or paired-end reads, and confidently showed that BovB in <italic>H. contortus</italic> is likely derived from a contamination, and that RTE1_Sar is a true endogenous element in the <italic>S. araneus</italic> genome. We tested for horizontal transfer of RTE1_Sar between <italic>S. araneus</italic> and nematodes by estimating a phylogeny and relative RTE1_Sar copy ages. We found that RTE1_Sar was probably horizontally transferred between an unsampled parasitic nematode and <italic>S. araneus</italic> after the split of the lineages leading to <italic>S. araneus</italic> and the hedgehog (<italic>Erinaceus europaeus</italic>, ca. 60 million years ago (mya) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Horizontal transfer of RTEs between parasitic nematodes and their hosts is not common</title><p>To detect potential cases of horizontal transfer of RTEs between parasitic nematodes and their hosts, we performed reciprocal sequence similarity searches. We used BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] to compare 33 mammalian RTEs (Repbase2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]) to 81 nematode genomes (WormBase ParaSite6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), and in addition 10 nematode RTEs to 98 mammalian genomes (RefSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], List of RTEs and genomes in Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>). To reduce false positives, at least 10 RTE hits were required per species. We detected RTE1_Sar originally described in the genome of the common shrew (<italic>S. araneus</italic>) in nine nematode species, and BovB from cattle (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) and sheep (<italic>Ovis aries</italic>) in two nematode species (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Table S1). We subsequently tested the different scenarios of horizontal transfer, contamination, and vertical transfer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Contamination in the <italic>S. araneus</italic> genome assembly does not confound RTE1_Sar HTT</title><p>Contamination of genome assemblies must be considered when searching for HTT. To determine whether nematode DNA, possibly including RTE1_Sar, may have contaminated the library preparation of the shrew genomic DNA, we assessed the general assembly quality and tested for any contamination from other organisms. If the <italic>S. araneus</italic> genome assembly contains other genes from nematodes with RTE1_Sar, it is more likely that RTE1_Sar is a contaminant of the genome.</p><p>We used BUSCO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to determine the assembly quality of <italic>S. araneus</italic> by testing for the presence of conserved genes. The assembly had a completeness score of 88% (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Table S2), above the average of vertebrates in Ensembl (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1).</p><p>To identify potential contamination of the <italic>S. araneus</italic> assembly, we assigned taxa of origin to the sequence reads from <italic>S. araneus</italic> with BlobTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We aligned the sequence reads to the reference assembly with Bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and compared the reads with DIAMOND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] against a UniProt reference proteomes database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Of the 2.5 billion sequence reads, 74% mapped to the <italic>S. araneus</italic> assembly. BlobTools estimated that 67% of the aligned reads are from Chordata, and that 7% are of nematode origin (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S2). The nematode species are from the distantly related orders of Trichocephalida and Strongylida (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Over 90% of the reads assigned to the Trichocephalida order mapped non-TE sequences, the rest of the reads mapped to TEs other than RTE1_Sar. In contrast to the reads of Trichocephalida origin, all but 0.8% of the Strongylida aligned reads matched the RTE1_Sar sequence. These 0.8% of reads from <italic>Angiostrongylus</italic> and <italic>Heligmosomoides</italic> aligned slightly better to RTE-5_CPB (<italic>Chrysemys picta bellii</italic>, the western painted turtle), but when submitted to the web-based version of the repeat annotation tool CENSOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] - using a different program to screen against repetitive elements - they were annotated as RTE1_Sar. Overall, this finding is consistent with contamination from <italic>Trichuris/Trichinella</italic> genomic DNA, but not with contamination from the Strongylida species.

This is accomplished by matching the mate of the read, or parts of a long read that do not code for the transposon, to either a donor (“non-self”) or recipient (“self”) database (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). If matched to a different taxon, the reads are contaminants. If the reads belong to the tested species/taxa, the transposon has possibly been horizontally transferred.

A second database (blue: “non-self”) contains genomes of the taxon of the species from which the RTE originates. 3. Depending on the comparisons of the reads to the databases, a decision is being made whether the reads containing the RTE belong to the tested species (hit “self” database) and are based on horizontal transfer (cyan), or if the complete long reads/read pairs belong to another taxon (hit “non-self” database) and are based on contamination (blue).

The three approaches, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, are based on long reads, or short reads with or without a reference assembly. The overall workflow is the same for all three approaches: First step: Identification of RTE coding reads was accomplished by 1) comparison to the RTE sequence directly (long reads and non-reference paired reads), or 2) by alignment to a reference assembly. Second step: Reads coding for RTEs are selected and masked for any repetitive sequences with RepeatMasker. Third step: Comparison of (partially) masked sequences to two databases, “self” and “non-self”. The “self” database includes genomes from the taxon of interest, and the “non-self” database includes genomes from species of potential HTT or contamination.</p><p>We used AviRTE as positive control and BovB as negative control after testing it first with the long reads method. PacBio long reads were available for <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic>, <italic>Loa loa</italic> and Anna’s hummingbird (<italic>Calypte anna</italic>), and Illumina read pairs and reference assemblies were available for <italic>S. araneus</italic>, <italic>H. contortus</italic> and the white-throated tinamou (<italic>Tinamus guttatus</italic>).</p><p>We tested if BovB, a transposable element of mammalian origin which we found in <italic>H. contortus</italic> and <italic>O. ochengi</italic>, results from contamination and hence can be used as negative control. We suspected that the observation of BovB in these nematode assemblies was a consequence of contamination with host DNA of sheep (<italic>O. aries</italic>) and cattle (<italic>B. taurus</italic>), respectively. PacBio long reads of <italic>H. contortus</italic> were publicly available. We identified reads with BovB, masked them for repeats with RepeatMasker, and mapped them to the two databases, “non-self” and “self”. Of all BovB-containing long reads, 97% (5309 of 5478) have better hits to mammalian genomes after masking than to nematode genomes. The remaining 3% that mapped against nematode might be the result of contamination of parasite genome assemblies. These results show that BovB transposons in the <italic>H. contortus</italic> assembly are most likely resulting from contamination by the sheep host.

A lower percentage of reads maps to nematodes (8.5% with reference genome, 14.8% without reference).

The first clade, including both <italic>Angiostrongylus</italic> species, <italic>Ancylostoma ceylanicum</italic> and <italic>Necator americanus</italic>, shows multiple small replication bursts over time, with increasingly young copies.

Some species are more prone for HTT than others, such as parasites that might facilitate HTTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Two cases of horizontal retrotransposon transfer include parasites either directly (AviRTE) or as a vector (BovB). Here, our aim was to identify potential horizontal RTE transfer between parasitic nematodes and their hosts in order to better understand the frequency of HTT between hosts and parasites. Out of 43 RTEs compared across 197 genomes, we identified a third RTE, RTE1_Sar, that has been horizontally transferred between parasites and their hosts. When testing <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and their wasp parasites, Ortiz et al. did not find strong evidence of HTT between parasites and their hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Instead, they found horizontal transfer between different <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. In our study, only a low amount of nematode RTEs were available, which were classified as RTEs from <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> and <italic>Pristionchus</italic>, which are free-living nematodes. In contrast to the study of Ortiz et al., we found one horizontal transfer between host and parasite, and no cases of HTT between free-living species.</p><p>Distinguishing between horizontal transfer and contamination is not easy. Analyses in the tardigrade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] over-turned earlier suggestions of horizontal gene transfer. We identified RTE1_Sar in parasitic nematodes, and have shown with subsequent analysis that it is not a contaminant in either nematodes or shrew. We designed a protocol to differentiate between contamination and horizontal transfer with long and short reads. The guaranteed continuity of long reads is more reliable that a region assembled from short reads. In the absence of long reads for <italic>S. araneus</italic>, we used paired-end short reads and validated them with PacBio long read libraries from <italic>H. contortus</italic>, <italic>L. loa</italic> and <italic>C. anna</italic>, including positive and negative controls. Our paired-end reads approach provides the same answers as the long read approach, which demonstrates it is a reliable method to test for contamination when no long reads are available.</p><p>We exclude a scenario of vertical inheritance and purifying selection coupled with loss of the TE in all other species than the ones included in this study. RTE1_Sar shows an extremely patchy taxonomic distribution, being only present in one mammal and nine parasitic nematodes. In a scenario of vertical inheritance, we would expect to see the transposon in more mammalian species, especially since it is highly abundant in the shrew. However, neither did we detect RTE1_Sar in the genomes of any other mammal, nor in raw reads of close relatives of <italic>S. araneus</italic>. In addition, to conserve the sequence similarity, there must have been purifying selection. We have shown that RTE1_Sar is evolving neutrally, and thus rule out the possibility of vertical transfer. <italic>S. araneus</italic> shares the highest sequence identity of RTE1_Sar with <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>: their consensus sequences are 80.1% identical. The sequence identity between <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and its closest related species included in the analysis, <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, is 80.6%. This suggests, together with the phylogenetic analysis, that RTE1_Sar was not transferred between <italic>S. araneus</italic> and one of the included nematodes, but that an unsampled nematode species was involved. This unsampled species could be an extant species related to <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, or a common ancestor. While all of the nematode species with RTE1_Sar are parasites of mammals, <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> and <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> have been found in the asian house shrew <italic>Suncus murinus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which, with <italic>Sorex</italic>, is a member of the family Soricidae. Rats are the common host of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic>, <italic>A. costaricensis</italic>, <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> and <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>, which does not exclude parasitism of shrew, as seen in the case of <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>. The other species included in this study are parasites of hamsters (<italic>A. ceylanicum</italic>), humans (<italic>A. ceylanicum</italic>, <italic>N. americanus</italic>) and ruminants (<italic>H. contortus</italic>, <italic>H. placei</italic>). Snails and slugs are the intermediate host of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> and <italic>A. costaricensis</italic>. Although both <italic>Angiostrongylus</italic> species have high RTE1_Sar copy number and sequence similarity to <italic>S. araneus</italic> RTE1_Sar, phylogenetic analysis on both nucleotide and amino acid level suggests that RTE1_Sar in <italic>S. araneus</italic> is closer related to the <italic>Nippostrongyloides</italic>/<italic>Heligmosomoides</italic> lineage. Three species of the <italic>Longistriata</italic> genus, which is closely related to <italic>Heligmosomoides</italic>, have been recorded as parasites of <italic>Sorex spp.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Another parasite of <italic>S. araneus</italic> is <italic>Soboliphyme soricis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], which is closely related to <italic>Trichinella</italic> and <italic>Trichuris</italic> and could explain the contamination we have observed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><p>The most parsimonious solution of the horizontal transfer of RTE1_Sar is a direct transfer between <italic>S. araneus</italic> and an unsampled nematode. In this case, the sequence identity between those species would be much higher than the observed sequence identities between the sampled species. In a different scenario, the transfer could have happened indirectly, facilitated by a vector such as a virus or a bacterium. Gilbert et al. demonstrated that transposons can transfer from insects into virus genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Other suggested vectors are endosymbiontic bacteria such as Wolbachia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which infect a number of filarial nematodes and insects, but none of the species described here.</p><p>The taxonomic distribution of RTE1_Sar, supported by the phylogeny would suggest the direction of the transfer from nematodes to an ancestor of <italic>S. araneus</italic>. We were unable to detect the element in the most closely related sequenced species to <italic>S. araneus</italic>: hedgehog, solenodon and star-nosed mole; but it is present in nine nematode species. A previous study showed that RTE1_Sar is more closely related to insect and nematode RTEs than to mammalian RTEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Copies in the <italic>S. araneus</italic> are highly abundant. Although not proof, this is consistent with horizontal transfer from nematodes and subsequent replication as opposed to vertical inheritance and loss in the other species. As for timing, the transfer must have occurred after the split of the lineages leading to <italic>Sorex</italic> and <italic>Erinaceus</italic>, since we did not detect the element in <italic>E. europaeus</italic>, the closest related species to <italic>S. araneus</italic> with a sequenced genome. The split of the lineages occurred ca. 60 million years ago (mya) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The uncertainty of the direction of the HTT and thus the origin of the element also shows that the transposon annotation in Repbase does not necessarily represent the species or lineage of origin, but the species in which the transposon was first identified. This needs to be considered in future studies, especially those investigating horizontal transfers.</p><p>We have analyzed the relative ages of RTE1_Sar copies across all species to describe the RTE1_Sar landscape and to discover potential replication bursts that might follow horizontal transfers. We did not observe sudden replication bursts of older copies in the shrew. Replication bursts indicate a horizontal transfer: genomes newly exposed to a transposon would not have any specific defense mechanisms, which allows for faster replication. The absence of replication bursts could be explained by pre-existing defense mechanisms from similar transposons.</p><p>The mechanisms of horizontal transposon transfer are still unclear, but there is a higher chance of HTT between physically or spatially connected species, such as parasites and their hosts. The study finding the highest amount of HTTs so far was conducted in insects, and found that transposons are more likely to be transferred to species sharing closer habitat space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We are still lacking truly comprehensive studies encompassing possible transmission routes between classes or even kingdoms. Venner et al. suggested the use of networks to find transposon transmission routes between interacting species, including parasites and pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Both viruses and endosymbiontic bacteria have been suggested as vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. With respect to nematodes, horizontal gene transfers from prokaryotes have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Beneficial plant cell wall-degrading enzymes were transferred from prokaryotes to plant parasitic nematodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. By knowing the organisms involved in HTT, including parasites and pathogens, we will be able to narrow down possible transfer mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>By understanding horizontal transposon transfers we get one step closer to understanding host-parasite interactions and their consequences on genome evolution.

The databases consisted of the genomes from nematodes and mammals (as described above) or birds (RefSeq, <italic>n</italic>=97) respectively, and the blast parameter for database size was adjusted to the largest genome of the two compared databases. The hits were ranked by bitscore. Since genomes were assembled from reads and thus contain the reads of their own species, hits of reads against the species’ own genome were discarded. The best hit for each read was used to specify the origin of the read as either “self” or as “non-self”, depending on if the best hit was against a species of the species’ taxon or against a species of a different taxon. For example, if the read of a nematode hits its own genome best, this hit is disregarded.

Second, we created RTE1_Sar consensus sequences for each species from the species-specific alignments of previously identified fragments with hmmbuild and hmmemit (HMMER v3.1b2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]). Third, we aligned the species-specific consensus sequences of RTE1_Sar with MAFFT. Last, this alignment was used to estimate the phylogenetic tree of RTE1_Sar with MrBayes v3.2.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We used the GTR model with gamma distribution (default: lset nst=6 rates=invgamma). We ran the MCMC for 12 million generations until convergence, with the potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) close to 1 for all parameters. We used RAxML on the same data set under the GTRGAMMA model with 1000 bootstraps. To construct trees based on amino acids, ORFs were identified in each RTE1_Sar consensus sequence using the NCBI ORFfinder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. For <italic>S. araneus</italic>, we could not identify a full-length ORF. Hence, we additionally identified the longest individual copy ORF. We extracted the ORF amino acid sequences and estimated their phylogenies using RAxML with the PROTGAMMAGTR model and 1000 bootstraps. Additionally, we constructed a tree with RAxML based on RTE1_Sar copies. Copies were identified using the species specific consensus sequence for searches with RepeatMasker and subsequent de-fragmentation using OneCodeToFindThemAll [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (–unknown –strict –fasta). The result was sorted by length (descending) and divergence (ascending), and the top 100 copies were extracted from the fasta files for each species. These copies were then aligned with MAFFT. We did not use an outgroup for the phylogeny, and left the tree unrooted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Relative age distribution</title><p>We calculated the Kimura 2-parameter distance (excluding CpG sites) using the package calcDivergenceFromAlign.pl from RepeatMasker for all RTE1_Sar copies to their species-specific consensus sequence as estimation of the relative age of each copy compared to the species consensus sequence. For raw values, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>. We then plotted the age distributions with R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>We are grateful to Dr. Alexander Suh for helpful discussions and suggestions.
