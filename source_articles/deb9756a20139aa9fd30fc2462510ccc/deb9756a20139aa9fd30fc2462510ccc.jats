Interestingly, patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or with non-CF bronchiectasis also show similar susceptibility to such infections. This may be due to the limited availability of immunoglobulins from the systemic circulation in the conductive airways, resulting in local immunodeficiency. Topical application of nebulized plasma-derived immunoglobulins may represent a means to address this deficiency. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of nebulizing plasma-derived immunoglobulins and delivering them into the airways of rats and non-human primates.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Distinct human plasma-derived immunoglobulin isotype preparations were nebulized with an investigational eFlow® nebulizer and analyzed in vitro or deposited into animals. Biochemical and immunohistological analysis of nebulized immunoglobulins were then performed. Lastly, efficacy of topically applied human plasma-derived immunoglobulins was assessed in an acute <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> respiratory infection in mice.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Characteristics of the resulting aerosols were comparable between preparations, even when using solutions with elevated viscosity. Neither the structural integrity nor the biological function of nebulized immunoglobulins were compromised by the nebulization process. In animal studies, immunoglobulins levels were assessed in plasma, broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) and on lung sections of rats and non-human primates in samples collected up to 72 h following application. Nebulized immunoglobulins were detectable over 48 h in the BAL samples and up to 72 h on lung sections. Immunoglobulins recovered from BAL fluid up to 24 h after inhalation remained structurally and functionally intact. Importantly, topical application of human plasma-derived immunoglobulin G into the airways of mice offered significant protection against acute pneumococcal pneumonia.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Taken together our data demonstrate the feasibility of topically applying plasma-derived immunoglobulins into the lungs using a nebulized liquid formulation.

In many PID patients, plasma immunoglobulins (Igs) are present at low levels or absent, leading to a high susceptibility to severe bacterial infections such as pneumonia. To overcome reduced antibody production, PID patients receive plasma-derived IgG as first line therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">While pneumonia events have decreased under optimized IgG substitution therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], recurrent and persistent infections in the airways are still widely observed in PID patients and can eventually contribute to the development of chronic lung disease, one of the main causes of mortality in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">While plasma proteins, including IgG, can reach the alveoli through transudation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], movement of plasma-derived Igs into the conducting or upper airways has not been described. Surveillance of these regions is mainly conducted by local components of the mucosal immune system. Thus, assuming that PID patients under IgG substitution therapy would still suffer local immunodeficiency, we hypothesized that protection of these areas of the respiratory tract might be best achieved by direct application of Igs via inhalation.</p><p id="Par36">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have normal systemic immunity. However, as a consequence of the disease, tissue remodelling of the bronchi has been associated to a reduction in secretory IgA (sIgA) levels at the mucosal surfaces of these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, sIgA from submucosal glands are snared into mucus plugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These processes may then result in local immunodeficiency of the airways of COPD patients.</p><p id="Par37">Several approaches are used to deliver proteins into the lungs. Nebulizers are the most commonly used inhalers as they allow the delivery of a higher dose of drug into the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, there is limited information on the aerosolizing of Igs with nebulizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Building on recent improvements in both device technology and drug formulation, we have assessed the feasibility of nebulizing highly concentrated plasma-derived Igs (50 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml) using a state-of-the-art active membrane nebulizer. Following the demonstration that the nebulization process left the antibody molecules intact and active, we topically applied these aerosols into the lungs of rats and non-human primates and recovered intact and functional Igs 24 h and 48 h, respectively, from lung washes of treated animals. In addition to IgG, we also compared IgA and IgM preparations as these Ig isotypes are also important effectors of pathogen neutralization at mucosal sites. At last, we assessed the efficacy of human plasma-derived immunoglobulins for preventing acute respiratory infection in mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of human plasma-derived Igs</title><p id="Par39">Human plasma-derived Igs were prepared as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. IgA and IgAM are obtained from an ion-exchange chromatography step used in the large-scale manufacture of IgG from human plasma. IgAM contains IgA and IgM in a 2:1 mass ratio. Elution fractions containing IgA (IgA and IgAM, respectively) were concentrated and to 50 mg/ml protein in PBS by tangential-flow filtration (TFF; Pellicon XL Biomax 30, Merck Millipore) and subsequently re-formulated at 50 mg/ml protein in 125 mM proline. Of note, IgG products are composed of 97% monomeric IgG and concentrated at 100 mg/ml (IgPro10, Privigen®). For some experiments IgPro10 was diluted with water to obtain a 50 mg/ml final concentration. IgA preparation is 98% IgA. IgAM contains at least 98% of Ig. 50% of IgA in IgAM preparation are of dimeric form. IgM is of pentameric form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aerosol generation and characterization</title><p id="Par40">Nebulization of Ig preparations was performed with an investigational electronic vibrating membrane nebulizer (eFlow®; PARI Pharma GmbH, Germany). The nebulizer used for the study is based on the eFlow® technology and includes an optimized membrane designed to generate a high output rate as well as a big mixing chamber (not yet commercially available). Droplet sizes (Mass Median Diameter (MMD)) and the droplet size distribution (Geometric Standard Deviation (GSD) measurements were conducted at PARI Pharma GmbH (Graefelfing, Germany) using laser diffraction (Malvern MasterSizerX). Test conditions were as followed: airflow: 20 L/min ± 1.0 L/min; temperature: 23 °C ± 2 °C; relative humidity: 50% ± 5%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>SEC and SDS-page</title><p id="Par41">Aerosol droplets were collected in polypropylene tubes. Structural integrity and multimerization of nebulized Ig preparations were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SDS-PAGE was performed using the Mini-Cell system of Life Technologies, according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Samples were denatured in sample buffer under reducing or non-reducing conditions, respectively. Electrophoretic separation was carried out on pre-cast gradient gels, NuPAGE Novex™ Bis-Tris 4–12% 1.0 mm 15 well, using NuPAGE™ MES electrophoresis buffer (Life Technologies). After electrophoresis, proteins in the gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie G-250 (SimplyBlue Safestain™; Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The protein staining pattern was digitally recorded using an ImageQuant™ LAS 4000 system (GE Healthcare Lifesciences).</p><p id="Par42">For SEC analysis, 2 μL of undiluted samples were injected into an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity™ HPLC system for size exclusion chromatography at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min over a TSK gel G3000SWxl 7.8 mm ID × 30 cm column (Tosoh Bioscience). From the resulting chromatograms the relative contents of Igs polymers/high molecular weight structures, dimers, monomers and fragments were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ig functions</title><p id="Par43">Fc activity: Respiratory burst was measured in purified human neutrophils. Rabbit erythrocytes (5 × 10<sup>6</sup>/ml) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with increasing amounts of the different Ig preparations (0–800 μg/ml). After washing they were added to purified human neutrophils (~ 5 × 10<sup>5</sup>/ml). Respiratory burst was measured by chemiluminescence after adding a luminol solution (Luminol Na-Salt, Sigma) to the cells and recording at 37 °C over 90 min. The area under the signal-to-time curve was calculated and translated as RLU (relative light units). In parallel, the amount of Ig binding the erythrocytes was determined by flow cytometry (anti-human IgG (Nordic), FACS Canto II, Becton Dickinson). Binding and chemiluminescence data were then represented on the Y and X axis of a graph, respectively. For every sample, the amount of Ig bound to the erythrocytes to induce half-maximum respiratory burst of the (pre-nebulisation) control sample was determined. Fc activity was calculated as a ratio of the control sample according to the formula: Fc activity (sample) = half maximum chemiluminescence control/half maximum chemiluminescence sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Antigen binding assay</title><p id="Par44">Nebulized and non-nebulized Igs were assayed against Influenza A Haemaglutinin (H1) (Abcam), Influenza A Neuraminidase (N1) (Abcam), Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Type 1(PnP1) (ATCC; 161-X), Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Type 3(PnP3) (ATCC; 32-X) and Tetanus Toxoid Antigen (TTA). H1 (1μg/ ml; 3 h at 37 °C), N1 (1μg/ ml; 3 h at 37 °C), PnP1 (5 μg/ ml; 1 h at 37 °C), PnP3 (5 μg/ ml; 1 h at 37 °C) and TTA (5 μg/ml; 1 h at 37 °C) were coated into wells of a 96 well plate for the indicated times. After wash with PBS-Triton X100 (0.05%), wells were blocked as followed. For H1 and N1, Smart Block (Candor) was used for 2 h at 37 °C. For PnP1 and PnP2, 2,5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (GIBCO) was used for 1.5 h at RT. At last, for TTA, Superblock (Thermo scientific) was used for 1 h at 37 °C. Following additional washing steps with PBS-Triton, diluted Ig samples (50 μg/ml in PBS) were added to the wells and incubated at RT for 1 h and further washed three times with PBS-Triton.</p><p id="Par45">For detection, HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG/A/M F(ab)‘2 HRP (1:2000 in PBS, Novex) was added for 2 h. Following five consecutive washes with PBS-Triton, chromogenic substrate (TMB, Fitzgerald) was added for 3-10 min and reaction was stopped with 50 μL HCl 1 M (Merck). Absorbance was read at 450 nm with reduction at 630 nm using an ELISA Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, Envision Xcite).</p><p id="Par46">Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples from the rat and NHP studies were selected for their equal content in IgG (50 μg/ml) to facilitate their comparison in an ELISA. Samples from vehicle-treated animals were used as negative control and as positive control, when spiked with 50 μg/ml non-nebulized IgG. Samples were measured in triplicates in TTA and PnP ELISAs as described above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> A66.1 type 3 (Spn3) binding assay</title><p id="Par47">To determine the total anti-Spn3 titer in the various preps, a PolySorp plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific #475094) was coated with 5x10<sup>7</sup>CFU/ml <italic>Strep pneumoniae</italic> A66.1 and incubated overnight at 4 °C.

Therefore, we tested the integrity and functionality of Ig samples recovered from rat BAL fluid 24 h, and from NHP BAL fluid 48 h after nebulization. No degradation of Igs was observed in either species (data not shown) indicating that Igs remained structurally sound in situ. To test antigen binding capacity of nebulized Igs we used ELISAs specific for tetanus toxoid or streptococcal polysaccharide as described above. IgG recovered from rat BAL fluid (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c) or NHP BAL fluid (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d and e) yielded an equivalent signal than the same amount of non-nebulized IgG spiked into fresh BAL fluid.

Delivered dose was measured by collecting the nebulized product on an inhalation filter, which was placed between the nebulizer mouth piece and the pump. Respirable dose (RD) was further calculated by applying the frequency of droplets with a size below 5 μm to the delivered dose values. As expected from the aerosol characteristics reported in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, delivered doses obtained for the 5% formulations were comparable, with values ranging from 49.36 to 50.92 mg (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). With a 2-fold higher concentration, the delivered dose of the 10%-formulated IgG was almost double that of the 5%-formulated IgG. However, when the delivered dose was expressed as a percentage of the total amount used in the assay, 10 and 5% formulations gave close results (45.4 to 51.4%). Respirable dose was also very similar for all formulations. These data suggest that around 35% of the Igs (RD &lt; 5 μm) could potentially deposit into human lungs (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).

Current therapies for COPD or PID patients do not completely protect against respiratory tract infections. To address this, we investigated the feasibility of the topical delivery of plasma-derived Igs directly into the lungs of patients via nebulization. Polyclonal, plasma-derived Igs manufactured from plasma pools of more than 1000 donors contain antibodies against a wide variety of bacterial and viral antigens. IgG-replacement therapy, for example, has been shown to be efficient at decreasing severe bacterial infections in PID patients, thus supporting the rationale for developing an inhaled version of the product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">The majority of plasma-derived Ig products on the market contain highly purified IgG. Other Ig isotypes that are naturally present in the respiratory tract, such as monomeric IgA and polymeric Igs (i.e. dimeric IgA and polymeric IgM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] are usually excluded from these products but can be obtained by plasma sub-fractionation. While their relative efficacies at preventing respiratory tract infections remain to be addressed, our data provide important insights into the feasibility of nebulizing several Ig isotypes, including polymeric forms, and into the extent of their deposition into mammalian lungs.</p><p id="Par80">Plasma-derived Igs are prepared in highly concentrated formulations (5–20%) for intravenous and subcutaneous delivery. The successful nebulization of low concentration IgG (up to 4%) has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] but, to our knowledge, we are the first to describe the robust and reproducible generation of aerosols from polyclonal Ig formulations at concentrations of 10% IgG. Moreover, the total output rate obtained for each formulation was high, which allowed for the rapid nebulization of Igs (2 ml within 3.5 min). Importantly, polymeric Igs (IgAM) at 5% final concentration could also be nebulized, despite the higher viscosity (3.74 mPa.s) of these preparations than a 10% IgG solution (3.20 mPa.s). In particular, the structure of a huge protein such as IgM was not affected. At last, nebulization is dependent on viscosity, and other devices have been unable to nebulize solutions with a viscosity higher than 2.74 mPa.s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par81">Optimal lung deposition is obtained for droplets with a diameter comprised between 5 and 1 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We showed that aerosol clouds generated from 4 different Ig formulations displayed similar, if not identical characteristics. Importantly, MMD obtained for each formulation was below 4 μm but above 1 μm, with a respirable fraction above 69%. Using 2 ml of each formulation (100–200 mg Ig) in breathing experiments, we extrapolated that the respirable dose would be approximately 35% in humans, which corroborate published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. While this number may seem low compared to the 100% dose available in systemic circulation after intravenous injection, it reflects a very good outcome with current state-of-the-art nebulizing technology. For instance, with older jet nebulizers only ~ 12% of the delivered dose reach the lung and best nebulizer achieve up to 41% delivered dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Several factors explain this outcome; presence of dead volume in the reservoir which account for a certain loss of the product, limitation to droplets below 5 μm to enter the lungs (bigger droplets will impact the mouth or throat), and exhalation of some of the aerosol droplets during breathing.</p><p id="Par82">Animal studies were performed to explore the feasibility of topically applying plasma-derived Igs using nebulizers into the upper and lower airways of normally breathing, conscious animals, without invasive tubing. Both rat and NHP studies successfully demonstrated the deposition of human IgG- and IgA-containing preparations into the conducting airways as well as the alveoli of treated lungs. Interestingly, the amount of human Igs found in the BAL of NHP were higher, which certainly points out the differences in breathing physiology and the size of the airways between the two species. Rodents are obligate nose-breathers while NHP can breathe through both the nose and mouth.</p><p id="Par83">The detection of human Ig in the BAL of NHP 48 h post-inhalation is a significant observation as inhaled particles are normally cleared rapidly from the lungs. Mucociliary clearance and alveolar macrophages are primarily involved in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Mucociliary clearance functions by moving the mucus present in the bronchi out of the respiratory tree and alveolar macrophages act as a primary barrier to macromolecule absorption in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Human Igs were detected in the BAL from rats and NHP at 24 h and 48 h post-inhalation, respectively, as well as on sections 72 h post-dose, and indicate the successful deposition of large amounts of Igs into the lungs of these animals. Nevertheless, weekly inhalations did not lead to an accumulation of nebulized Igs when measured immediately post-dose. This suggests that the amount of nebulized Igs remaining in the lungs 7 days post-inhalation was negligible, in line with published results obtained in mice with an inhaled anti-VEGF antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par84">As mucus turnover is considered to take place over 24 h, it is not clear whether the nebulized Igs detected in the BAL of rats and NHP at 24 h and 48 h post-dose, respectively, account for the Igs remaining in the alveolar space or the bronchi. IHC data from the rat study suggest that there are still detectable amounts of human IgG in the terminal bronchi 24 h post-deposition. This may be a result of the mucociliary clearance in rats not being able to remove all the deposited human Ig present on the bronchi within 24 h, or it may reflect the presence of xenoreactive antibodies in the formulations, which would remain bound to the epithelium. Future studies should assess the clearance rate of inhaled Ig from the human bronchi.</p><p id="Par85">The amount of nebulized Ig that was absorbed through the lung epithelium remains uncertain. From the IHC data, IgG could not be detected in the epithelium of the lungs at 24 h post-dose. Bioavailability of nebulized Igs in the systemic circulation was also addressed. No human IgG1 nor IgA1 could be detected in all serum samples collected from NHPs (LLOQ values for IgG1 and IgA1 being of 5.64 μg/ml and 16.09 μg/ml respectively). Nevertheless, the absence of detectable Ig levels suggests that, if at all, only small amounts of Ig were systemically absorbed after nebulization.</p><p id="Par86">The hydrophilic and lipophilic properties of proteins render them susceptible to adsorption or aggregation at interfaces. In this present study, we did not detect any increase in aggregates after nebulization despite the use of Ig preparations that were highly concentrated. Nevertheless, potential immune-complex mediated adverse effects will need to be carefully monitored in initial human studies, especially in patients with underlying lung damage and lung inflammation.</p><p id="Par87">At mucosal surfaces, Igs prevent pathogen adhesion and invasion through immune exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Using antigens from respiratory tract pathogens or a specific <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> infection model, we showed that antigen binding was unaffected after nebulization, despite nebulizing highly concentrated Igs of monomeric or polymeric forms, and that nebulized polymeric Igs retained their ability to bind and agglutinate bacteria. Finally, the Fc portions of nebulized Ig preparations were also found to be fully functional at triggering respiratory burst in human neutrophils in complexed form. Overall, these results demonstrate that nebulization of monomeric and polymeric Igs at high concentrations with the eFlow® nebulizer had no impact on their structure or function.</p><p id="Par88">To obtain further support for administering nebulized plasma-derived Igs into patients, we assessed the ex vivo activity of nebulized Igs recovered from the BAL of NHP and rats using ELISAs measuring the binding of human IgG to tetanus toxoid antigen and pneumococci polysaccharides, to lower endogenous Ig (e.g. in vehicle-treated animals) background signal. We could verify that nebulized Igs appeared fully functional in the lungs of the animals, even when their activity was assessed 48 h post-deposition, suggesting a low catabolic activity in the lungs. Altogether, we showed that highly concentrated Igs retain their functions upon nebulization and in situ for at least 48 h.</p><p id="Par89">Respiratory tract infections affect millions of patients each year, with at-risk groups including COPD, NCFB and PID patients. To prevent these infections in PID patients, prophylactic use of antibiotics is often prescribed in combination with IgG replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. While antibiotics have proven to be efficacious at reducing bacterial infections, the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains is a concern particularly in PID patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Passive immunization with topically applied plasma-derived Igs may be an attractive alternative to antibiotics to prevent respiratory tract infections from bacterial as well as viral origins.</p><p id="Par90">In this study, we show that human plasma-derived immunoglobulin G given prophylactically display a high degree of protection against an acute <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> respiratory infection in mice. <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is a human pathogen, which remains a leading cause of serious illness among infants, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It infects the host mainly through the respiratory tract and can cause life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis when reaching the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The large number of pneumococcal serogroups is a hurdle for the design of effective vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Alternative approaches such as the use of plasma-derived immunoglobulins may represent an optimal protection strategy against this pathogen. The model of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection in mice was chosen for its close mimic to the human disease. Innate immunity provides protection against low doses of bacteria (up to 10<sup>5</sup> in mice). However, higher doses escape immunity with the bacteria becoming invasive and leading to fatal sepsis. In support of this fact, 90% of vehicle treated animals died 6 days after receiving the bacteria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).</p><p id="Par91">Topical application of nebulized drugs into the airways of mice is challenging as rodents have complex turbinates, which efficiently filter aerosols. Moreover, accurate dosing of mice in nebulization chambers is not feasible as aerosols will also deposit on their fur and can be potentially licked. To investigate the efficacy of human-plasma derived immunoglobulins in our infection model, we therefore directly deposited the Ig preparations into the nares of anesthetized mice using a pipette.</p><p id="Par92">IgA-containing preparations did not show efficacy in this model. IgA showed slightly lower titers against the A66.1 bacteria than IgG, which could explain this outcome. However, IgAM had similar titers as IgG. Severity of the infection model or the type of pathogen used may account for this difference in efficacy, particularly since IgG-mediated opsonophagocytosis has been described as the optimal correlate of protection against pneumococcal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Secretion of IgA1 proteases by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains could also potentially explain the lack of protection by human-plasma-derived IgA, which are mainly IgA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Further evaluation of the efficacy of these immunoglobulins to protect against respiratory pathogens is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par93">We are demonstrating the feasibility to nebulized highly concentrated plasma-derived immunoglobulins into animal lungs without loss of their functions. Nebulization of a 10% (100 mg/ml) protein solution such as IgG has, to our knowledge, never been shown before. In addition, we showed that nebulization process did not harm multimeric immunoglobulins (dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM), an information which was unknown until now. At last, and importantly, our study did not use any artificial delivery system or procedure (e.g. microsprayer or intra-tracheal delivery) to increase deposition in animal. Data on deposition and distribution of inhaled plasma-derived immunoglobulins in animal lungs reflects real breathing conditions and therefore real deposition. We showed that nebulized Immunoglobulins could be distributed in both rat and NHP lungs from the bronchi to the alveoli. Topically applied immunoglobulins also protected mice against an acute bacterial respiratory infection. This indicated that the approach to use nebulized immunoglobulins topically into the lungs to prevent infections in human is feasible. Formal non-clinical safety studies to determine the maximal tolerable dose followed by cautions first-in-human safety studies will be the logical next development steps.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>We thank Dr. Blaise Corthésy and Dr. Samuel Hou (CSL Behring) for advices and critical reading of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par94">Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par95">The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>CV, MOS, IC and AZ wrote the manuscript.

PBS and proline formulations of diverse Ig preparations were nebulized side by side. Mass median diameter (A), total output rate (B) and respirable fraction (C) were measured using laser diffraction. <bold>Figure S2.</bold> Chromatograms of IgA and IgAM separated by size exclusion. A.B. Chromatograms of IgA (5%) (A) and IgAM (5%) (B) separated by size exclusion are represented. Blue chromatograms refer to the nebulized (N) formulation. Red chromatograms refer to the non-nebulized, or control (Co), formulation. <bold>Figure S3.</bold> Nebulized Igs retain their function in an in vitro model of Shigella infection. Polarized Caco-2 cell monolayers were infected overnight with Shigella flexneri alone or in presence of nebulized or non-nebulized Ig formulations. A. Quantitative analysis of infected areas was determined from laser scanning confocal microscopy pictures using ImageJ software. B-D. Basolateral secretion of TNF-α (B), CXCL8 (C), and CCL3 (D) was measured by ELISA. Non-infected Caco-2 cell monolayers served as a control. <bold>Figure S4.</bold> Lung tissue from IgG, IgA, IgAM- and vehicle-treated animals (NHP) were collected 72 h post-exposure (4th inhalation) and were fixed and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were analyzed for IgG (A) and IgA (B) using specific secondary antibody coupled to HRP. For each detection antibody, detection of lung tissue obtained from a vehicle-treated animal is shown. It represents the level of background of the detection antibody.
