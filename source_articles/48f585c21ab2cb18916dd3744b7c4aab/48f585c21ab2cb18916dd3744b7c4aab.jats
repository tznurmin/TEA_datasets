The human gastric pathogen <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, which is known for its extreme genetic diversity, possesses highly efficient transformation and recombination systems to achieve this diversity, but it is unclear to what extent these systems influence ICE physiology. In this study, we have examined the excision/integration and horizontal transfer characteristics of an ICE (termed ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic>) in these bacteria. We show that transfer of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> DNA during mating between donor and recipient strains is independent of its conjugation genes, and that homologous recombination is much more efficient than site-specific integration into the recipient chromosome. Nevertheless, ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> excision by site-specific recombination occurs permanently in a subpopulation of cells and involves relocation of a circularization-dependent promoter. Selection experiments for excision indicate that the circular form of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> is not replicative, but readily reintegrates by site-specific recombination. Thus, although ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> harbours all essential transfer genes, and typical ICE functions such as site-specific integration are active in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, canonical ICE transfer is subordinate to the more efficient general DNA uptake and homologous recombination machineries in these bacteria.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bayerische Forschungsstiftung (Bavarian Research Foundation)</institution><institution-id

They are typically integrated into the host chromosome and get replicated and transferred to daughter cells during cell division, but they can also excise from the host chromosome and spread horizontally by conjugative transfer to a recipient cell. Subsequently, transferred circular ICE intermediates can integrate into the recipient cell’s chromosome, thus completing a canonical ICE life cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

It is not uncommon that individuals are co-infected with two or more distinct strains. Therefore, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> genomes evolve during long-term infection not only by accumulating mutations, but also by import and recombination of larger DNA fragments from co-infecting strains, which may amount to significant fractions of the corresponding genomes, making recombination the most important driver of diversification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. DNA uptake is mediated by a natural transformation system, comprising the ComB type IV protein transport system and the ComEC cytoplasmic membrane DNA channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, which reaches enormous uptake rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Apart from uptake and homologous recombination of extracellular DNA fragments, mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, phages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and ICEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> may contribute to increased strain diversity. The <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> ICEs (ICE<italic>Hptfs3</italic> and ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic>), which are sometimes located in regions of genome plasticity, but have a variety of possible integration sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, generally contain complete sets of genes required to produce type IV secretion machineries, as well as genes encoding different DNA-processing proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Several ICE genes have been suggested as disease markers, for instance <italic>dupA</italic> as a marker for duodenal ulcer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, or <italic>jhp950</italic> as a marker for marginal zone B-cell MALT lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, virulence-associated phenotypes of individual ICE-encoded proteins have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, but the functions of the ICEs within the infection process are currently not well-understood.</p><p id="Par5">We have previously reported that a resistance gene marker inserted into the ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> element of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strain P12 could be transferred from donor to recipient bacteria co-cultivated in the presence of DNase I to prevent natural transformation, suggesting that conjugative transfer of the whole genome island takes place<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, such a transfer was only achieved when recipient strains harboring at least a part of a similar ICE element were used. Here, we have characterized this transfer as well as the excision step from the chromosome further, and we show that none of the genes on ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> is essential for transfer of the resistance marker under standard mating conditions. We have further characterized the requirements for excision of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> from the chromosome, and we show that transfer of this 41 kb ICE is independent of the presence of integration sites or the XerT recombinase. Thus, although comparative genomic analysis strongly suggests a transfer activity of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> in a classical, ICE-like manner, this mechanism is superimposed in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> by the much more efficient recombination machinery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Horizontal transfer of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> fragments is mediated by homologous recombination</title><p id="Par6">ICEs are generally transferred horizontally by conjugation of circular intermediates excised from the chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. When ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> was provided with a chloramphenicol resistance (<italic>cat</italic>) gene, transfer of this resistance could be shown by co-cultivation with a recipient strain in the presence of DNase I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, since heterologous recipient strains lacking ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> failed to take up the resistance gene in such transfer experiments, we were previously unable to show transfer of the complete ICE. Thus, we could not exclude partial ICE transfer and integration via homologous recombination rather than site-specific integration. To be able to estimate the size of transferred DNA segments, we first performed transfer experiments in a homeologous system, i.e. with the P12 [ICE<italic>Hptfs4::cat</italic>] donor and a kanamycin-resistant G27 recipient strain. Individual double-resistant clones were analysed by sequencing the region surrounding the insertion site of the <italic>cat</italic> gene, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms between donor and recipient strains were used to identify recombination breakpoint regions. Such breakpoints were typically located 400–4,000 bp away from the <italic>cat</italic> insertion site (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Since these import lengths are typical for DNA introduced by natural transformation and subsequent homologous recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, this indicates that most transfer events under the applied conditions are indeed mediated by homologous recombination into a pre-existing ICE, rather than by transfer and site-specific integration of the complete element. To check for strain dependence, we conducted a reverse mating experiment with a chloramphenicol-resistant G27 donor and a kanamycin-resistant P12 recipient, and found similar, or slightly elevated, import lengths that ranged up to 13500 bp (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Such higher import lengths (&gt;13 kb) were also detected previously for transfer experiments between homologous strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and were interpreted as transfer of the complete island, but the present data suggest that an exchange of smaller ICE fragments occurs preferentially.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Determination of transferred fragment sizes in a homeologous system.

In fact, when a mutant lacking all putative type IV secretion genes (P12ΔICEmid; Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>), was used as a donor strain, it was still able to transfer its chloramphenicol resistance to a wild-type recipient at a slightly reduced rate, which did not reach statistical significance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

To characterize horizontal transfer of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> further, we therefore performed mating experiments with recipient strains lacking genes required for DNA uptake or processing. DNA uptake is considered a two-step process, in which transport across the outer membrane is mediated by the ComB system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and transport across the cytoplasmic membrane by the ComEC channel protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Interestingly, when we used a Δ<italic>comB</italic> recipient strain for transfer experiments, we obtained ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> transconjugants at a strongly reduced rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting that the ComB apparatus is not strictly required, but supports DNA uptake during ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> transfer, as previously reported for plasmid DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To our surprise, however, no transconjugants were ever obtained with a Δ<italic>comEC</italic> recipient strain, indicating that ComEC is strictly required not only for DNA uptake by transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, but also during conjugation. During transformation, DNA taken up is integrated into the chromosome via homologous recombination, which is driven by the RecA recombinase and supported by the loading protein DprA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. To check whether chromosomal integration of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> occurs independent of homologous recombination, we therefore used Δ<italic>recA</italic> and Δ<italic>dprA</italic> mutant strains as recipients. Surprisingly, the Δ<italic>recA</italic> mutant was unable to integrate ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> DNA, while integration was still possible in the <italic>dprA</italic> mutant, albeit at minimal rates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

First, control experiments in which the recipients were incubated with donor strain DNA instead of the strains themselves were clearly susceptible to DNase treatment (data not shown). Second, when the mating experiments were performed in the absence of DNase I, transfer rates were increased by roughly two orders of magnitude for both plasmid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and ICE transfer (data not shown). Third, there seems to be, at least to some degree, a dependence of transfer rates on type IV secretion system genes in the donor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, arguing for a certain contribution of a conjugation-like process. Fourth, ICE transfer is still possible with a <italic>comB</italic> deletion in the recipient strain, which renders this strain fully transformation-deficient. Remarkably, the reduction of transfer efficiency from the wild-type donor to the Δ<italic>comB</italic> recipient strain is much stronger as from the conjugation-deficient (ΔICEmid) donor to the wild-type strain, suggesting a convergence of different pathways into the ComB, and subsequently the ComEC, pores. One possible explanation for <italic>comB</italic>-independent (or also conjugation-independent) transfer would be a close contact between donor and recipient cells in the mating experiments, which might facilitate DNA transfer in a DNase-insensitive manner. This has been discussed previously as ADR (alternative DNase-resistent) transfer in the case of plasmid conjugation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, it is possible that transformation is responsible for a major part of the <italic>comB</italic>-dependent transfer events observed here, with DNA provided by the donor bacteria in a state protected from DNase degradation. Other ways to reduce natural transformation, such as decreasing the extracellular pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, might be applied to clarify this point in future studies.</p><p id="Par21">Further support for a non-classical ICE transfer mechanism comes from the observation that excision of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> from the chromosome, and thus generation of a circular ICE intermediate, is not a prerequisite for transfer. Both a deletion of the <italic>xerT</italic> gene, or mutation of the integration site, result in a loss of ICE excision, but not in a reduction of ICE transfer, even under conditions where full-length ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> is transferred. This strongly suggests that a pathway for mobilization of chromosomal DNA fragments must exist, a conclusion that is also supported by an early report of antibiotic resistance marker transfer between <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Currently, it is not clear whether ICE DNA can be mobilized directly from chromosomal <italic>oriT</italic> sites by a rolling circle replication mechanism, or which other mechanisms might be involved. Rolling circle replication is usually assumed to occur from circular ICE intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and two possible nicking sites for the ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic>-encoded relaxase HPP12_451/Rlx2 ((T/C)ATCCTG(C/T)) have already been identified in the ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> sequence, as well as in a few other chromosomal locations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Since one HPP12_451/Rlx2 nicking site was identified in ICE<italic>Hptfs3</italic>, ICE<italic>Hptfs3</italic> and ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> relaxases (Rlx1/Rlx2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> might be able to replace each other, so that Rlx1 (HPP12_1353) might be involved in ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> relaxation as well. In the same context, we cannot rule out that other ICE<italic>Hptfs3</italic> genes are able to take over corresponding functions in the ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> gene knockout strains, but it should be noted that strain P12 harbors a truncated ICE<italic>Hptfs3</italic> variant lacking a <italic>virB6</italic> ortholog<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In any case, mobilization is clearly RecA-independent, since all donor strains were <italic>recA</italic>-deficient.</p><p id="Par22">Transfer of full-length ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> furthermore shows that DNA fragments with a size of more than 40 kb can be recombined into the recipient chromosome, which is not commonly observed for DNA fragments integrated after transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The reduced efficiency of full-length ICE integration can thus easily be explained by the size of the fragment to be exchanged, as also evident in the case of the ΔICEmid donor strain, where a fragment of only 5 kb needs to be recombined in the ΔICE recipient strain. Consistent with the finding that large heterologous DNA fragments are prone to degradation by restriction enzymes, while genomic integration of homeologous DNA is permitted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, we were able to show transfer of full-length ICE only in a homologous system, but not in a homeologous system, where shorter fragments were exchanged. Nevertheless, site-specific integration of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> via the canonical mechanism must have occurred as well during <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> evolution, since homologous recombination alone cannot explain ICE integration in many chromosomal locations, as observed in strains from different <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In comparison to the recombination events described here, however, such a canonical integration seems to be rare. Therefore, we expect that coinfection with different <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains will frequently lead to reshaping pre-existing ICEs by gene transfer and homologous recombination, or even to integration of full-length ICEs at predefined genomic positions (similar to integration of the <italic>cag</italic>PAI, for which we could show homologous recombination), but only rarely to <italic>de novo</italic> ICE integration by site-specific recombination.</p><p id="Par23">Although ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> excision is not required for its transfer, we show that excision constitutively occurs at a rather low rate (in the order of 10<sup>−5</sup>), and that it depends on <italic>xerT</italic>, the AAGAATG integration sequence, and the <italic>xerT</italic> upstream region. Excision of ICEs can be replicative, generating a second, circular copy of the element, but in most cases, excised forms do not replicate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We did not find any evidence for stable excision of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> from the chromosome. Thus, we were unable to isolate circular forms using plasmid preparation protocols. Even an enforced excision of the chloramphenicol-selectable ICE variants did not result in stable circular products. Instead, tandem ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> integration by site-specific recombination seems to be the preferred way of dealing with the selective pressure. Remarkably, the chloramphenicol-resistant clones did not revert to the wild-type arrangement when selection was terminated (data not shown), suggesting that this tandem integration is not particularly unstable.</p><p id="Par24">An intriguing feature of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> is that its excision involves relocation of a promoter, with subsequent transcription of genes adjacent to the ICE RJ. This represents one possibility for achieving an excision-dependent switch in the ICE transcriptional profile. It is not clear how many genes are expressed by the relocated promoter; in principle, transcription could go as far as the coupling protein gene (<italic>virD4</italic>/<italic>hpp12_454</italic>) and include almost all type IV secretion genes, similar to the situation in Tn916<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. On the other hand, an independent transcriptional start site has previously been identified upstream of the <italic>hpp12_471</italic> ortholog <italic>hp0444</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and in an ICE<italic>Hptfs4b</italic> variant, this gene is indeed co-transcribed with several <italic>virB</italic> orthologs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In any case, transcription of <italic>hpp12_473</italic> and <italic>hpp12_472</italic> is very likely switched on in the excised version of ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> only. These genes are well conserved in ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> elements, although their functions are currently unclear. The principle of a terminal ICE gene which is put under the control of a promoter upon circularization has been described previously for other ICE elements, for example as a means to express the transfer genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, or as a mechanism for ICE maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Generally, ICE activation is subject to complex regulatory networks, which respond to conditions such as DNA damage, cell density, nutrient deprivation, or the presence of antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Although several ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> genes have been reported to be upregulated at pH 5 or upon contact with eukaryotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, it is currently unclear how ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> activation is regulated. Introduction of a chloramphenicol resistance gene, as in P12 [RJ-cat] or P12 [mini-RJ-cat], and selection for ICE excision simulates in this regard constitutive activation of the ICE, which is generally considered to be deleterious to the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As discussed above, ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> evades this constitutive excision by tandem integration, which does not change the location of the P<sub>LJ</sub> promoter in comparison to the circular form. Theoretically, site-specific integration into any other permissive AAGAATG motif located in proximity to an appropriate promoter would be possible as well, but was not observed. In any case, tandem integration is most likely a consequence of the inability of circularized ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> to replicate.</p><p id="Par25">In conclusion, despite the fact that ICE<italic>Hptfs3</italic> and ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> possess all canonical ICE features and have evolved to integrate into many possible chromosomal sites, they are subject to horizontal transfer and integration mechanisms by different pathways, as <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> plasmids and possibly other chromosomal regions are. Even in an environment containing DNases, these pathways are much more efficient than the classical ICE transfer mechanisms involving conjugation and site-specific integration. Site-specific excision is always detectable in a fraction of the bacterial population, suggesting that rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions is occasionally required. It will be intriguing to identify the environmental cues that lead to ICE<italic>Hptfs4</italic> activation, and thus to better understand the functions of these ancient genome islands.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p id="Par26"><italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains were grown on GC agar plates (Oxoid) supplemented with vitamin mix (1%) and horse serum (8%) (serum plates) and cultured for 16 to 48 h in a microaerobic atmosphere (85% N<sub>2</sub>, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, 5%O<sub>2</sub>) at 37 °C. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains were grown on Luria–Bertani (LB) agar plates supplemented with antibiotics, as appropriate.
