The United Kingdom has persistent problems with yield instability, but the underlying causes remain unclear. We tested whether temperature plays a role in UK winter oilseed rape (WOSR) yield variation through analysis of aggregated country-wide on-farm yield data and in annual Recommended List variety trial data run by the UK Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB). Our analyses of the two independent datasets both show that mean temperature in early winter is strongly and uniquely linked to variation in WOSR yield, with a rise in mean temperature of 1 °C associated with an average reduction of 113 (+−21) kg ha<sup>−1</sup> in yield. We propose that understanding the mechanism by which early winter chilling affects WOSR yield will enable the breeding of varieties with a more stable and resilient yield in Western Europe as climatic variation increases.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>RCUK | Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">BB/P012574/1</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">BB/R004196/1</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">BB/P013511/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>James K.

Extreme environmental events such as heat, drought and flooding have important effects on global crop yields and are being exacerbated by environmental change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, even in the absence of extreme weather events inter-annual variation in yields can remain substantial. In oilseed rape normal variation in temperature and rainfall have important effects on yields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In European winter oilseed rape (WOSR), yield variation caused by weather was much larger than that attributable to differences between cultivars in multisite trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and the genotype by environment (G × E) interaction was small. This indicates a lack of variation in yield stability traits in modern hybrids. Although advances in breeding have increased global rapeseed yields, this has not been accompanied by gains in yield stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. For instance, in Europe increases in yield stability have only been found in environments that cause low overall yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Several studies have linked developmental stages of rapeseed production with environmental variables such as light levels, photoperiod, temperature and rainfall, revealing those important for crop yields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In central Europe temperature during seed filling is most strongly linked to yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, whereas in Argentina, precipitation rates are limiting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Studies at different sites therefore have the potential to uncover yield contingencies that may be masked at other sites through lack of weather variation at specific growth stages. Recent UK winter rapeseed harvests have shown high variability and thus it has become important to understand the mechanisms by which this yield variation occurs, and how this yield variation might be being affected by climate change.</p><p id="Par4">To understand sources of yield instability in the UK rapeseed crop we sought to analyse the effects of temperature during 36 20-day windows of WOSR development. This analysis focusses on aggregated UK-wide yield data, and resulted in the identification of temperature windows with potentially important relationships with WOSR yield. The importance of highly correlated temperature windows was then tested in a separate dataset from 15 years of trials run by the UK Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB). We show that across the two independent datasets, low temperatures at the end of November and beginning of December have a large association with UK rapeseed yields which is independent of genotype and trial location. Because low temperatures during this period are associated with higher yields, we conclude that December chill is a major determinant of UK rapeseed yields.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aggregated UK winter rapeseed yield analysis</title><p id="Par5">Aggregated UK-wide statistics for on-farm yields are published annually by the government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) for England, accessed on 08/02/2016 and 01/02/2018: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/agriculture-in-the-united-kingdom" ext-link-type="url">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/agriculture-in-the-united-kingdom</ext-link>. We chose to focus on data since 1990 because yield data prior to this time are marked by substantial rises and falls and because it coincides with widespread adoption of so-called ‘double low’ germplasm in the United Kingdom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. After 1990 steadily increasing on-farm yields over time can be approximated by a simple linear model. To approximate UK-wide mean temperature we used daily mean temperature data from the Met Office Hadley Centre Central England Temperature (HadCET) Series available at the NCAS British Atmospheric Data Centre, accessed on 08/01/2016 at the UK Met Office website<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Data are reported as the yield (in tonnes ha<sup>−1</sup>) for each variety as a mean of two trial plots at each site. Yield data from all trials was collated resulting in a dataset with 6378 individual data points on yield, covering 15 years, 86 named trial sites and 252 varieties. Trial sites which were within 15 km of each other, in similar geographic situations and run by the same trialling company were grouped into locations for the purpose of data analysis (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). We analysed two subsets of data. The main analysis was of yields from 21 trial locations (sites or groups of sites) used in at least five years and 29 varieties trialled over at least five years, giving a total of 1685 data points. An additional analysis included data from a total of 36 locations used in at least two years and all 251 varieties grown in those trials, with a total of 6314 values of yield. Data from 14 sites which were used in only one year and were not near another location were omitted from the analysis. Daily mean temperature data was not reported at all trial locations so we used the UK Meteorological Office MIDAS Land and Marine Surface Station Data UK daily temperature dataset (<ext-link xlink:href="https://services.ceda.ac.uk" ext-link-type="url">https://services.ceda.ac.uk</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, the frequency of large deviations from the mean yield has been high since 2010.

Both December and October temperature had a significant relationship with yield, whatever the order in which the different monthly temperatures were added to the model (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). December temperature in particular had a strong negative correlation with yield, and December temperature and year explained 60% of yield variation in the dataset (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). There was a negative correlation between October and December temperatures (P = 0.01) implying that these effects are partially aliased.</p><p id="Par9">Winter temperature in the UK is strongly affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; 19), and recent variation in the mean temperature between December 1<sup>st</sup>–20<sup>th</sup> correlates with the winter NAO index for the corresponding year (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Data were available for the years 2002–2016 (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). In the RL trials, mean yield also increased on average between 2002 and 2016, as in the aggregated national data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), and the national on-farm dataset and RL trial dataset shared features such as increased variation in yield measurements in later years (Figs <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). A key difference between the two datasets is that because the RL trial data is listed by variety, we can separate yield variation achieved through breeding from that which results from other factors. Thus we assembled a dataset with 6378 individual yield measurements, using 21 trial locations used at least twice across 15 years and omitting 415 data points from isolated trial sites used only in one year. Each trial was associated with a mean October and mean ‘December’ temperature, with December referring to the period between November 25<sup>th</sup> and December 21<sup>st</sup> for that WOSR growing season (see methods). Initial analysis showed that October and December temperature were cooler at higher latitudes, and thus we could observe a positive relationship between October and December temperature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C–E</xref>). However, there was no clear relationship between latitude and mean trial yield (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>), despite the fact that lower temperatures appeared to be associate with higher yields (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4G,H</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>WOSR yield relationships in the AHDB National List trials dataset.

Therefore, rapeseed yield relationships with October temperature are not stable over time in UK on-farm data, and currently are not associated with yield variation. Furthermore, we cannot rule out that a link between October temperature and yield appears only when October mean temperature is negatively-correlated with December mean temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>), which would indicate that the October temperature has a correlative rather than causal relationship with yield.</p><p id="Par17">Trial location had an important relationship with yield (P &lt; 0.001), with the highest-yielding location, Wardington, yielding on average 2042 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> higher than the lowest-yielding site, Owmby-by-Spital.

With on-farm yields showing inter-annual variation of up to 0.8 tonnes ha<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), understanding the factors that cause yield variation could lead to improvements in predicting yield variation and allow us to understand how climate change is affecting WOSR yields.</p><p id="Par22">We tested the effects of temperature variation on UK rapeseed yields, and found strong correlations with temperature during October and even more so, the first 20 days in December for time-series including 25 years starting in 1990 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, in a second larger dataset from 2002 to 2016 we could confirm the strong effect of December temperature, but not the effect of October (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The important period from late November through December coincides with the period of growth cessation which separates growth stages BBCH19 from BBCH31, after the completion of vegetative development but before elongation of the inflorescence begins. During this period the early developmental events that determine canopy characters occur, and canopy area is known to be highly correlated with WOSR yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Analysing the same time window in the national dataset also does not yield a strong correlation with October mean temperature, suggesting that temperature during this period has become less associated with yields in recent years (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). This analysis resembles that observed for wheat grain characters in the long term Broadbalk experiment, where a positive relationship between NAO and Hagberg falling number was stable over short timescales, but varied in decadal timescales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The effect of December temperature variation was to reduce yields by 78 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> in the UK farm yield dataset and 116 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> in the Recommended List field trials for each 1 °C increase in mean temperature. The difference in the size of the effect probably reflects the nature of crop management in the two situations, because RL Treated Yield trials aim to reveal varieties’ yield potential under optimal crop management. Therefore, improvements in agronomy on UK farms using current knowledge may increase yields, but is unlikely to improve yield stability. Scaling for UK cropping area and price, on-farm yield variation attributable to December temperature has led to large fluctuations in national income from the rapeseed harvest, with the gap between the lowest and highest income years exceeding £150 million. Previous work has identified a link between photosynthetically active radiation during pod filling and yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Here we show that the effects of chilling are also associated with high yields.</p><p id="Par23">Temperature in December period correlates strongly with the NAO index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, suggesting that the NAO is a major driver of UK winter rapeseed yields. Indeed, we found that winter NAO index is negatively-correlated with the yield anomaly, i.e. the deviation of WOSR yield from its 10-year average (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). This is consistent with known effects of the NAO on phenology in natural ecosystems in Northern Europe, where the NAO explains between 9 and 28% of variation in flowering dates and 63% of variance in boreal phenology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, invertebrate population behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and fish spawning time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This has implications for future yields because climate change is interacting with the NAO to increase variation in mid-latitude temperatures during winter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">There is some variation between WOSR varieties in the extent to which their yields fall as mean temperature during the critical period of December rises. The variety with the strongest yield response to temperature, DK Cabernet, was predicted to have a difference in yield of 2,083 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> between the years with the highest and lowest mean December temperatures (10.47 °C and −2.9 °C respectively; mean yield predicted across sites) while the least responsive variety, Castille, was predicted to have a yield difference of only 789 kg ha<sup>−1</sup>. From these results, we predict that substantial, unforeseen yield losses may be caused by warmer Decembers in highly temperature-responsive varieties. The lack of a significant correlation between varieties’ responses to temperature and their predicted mean yield across years and sites indicates, however, that the two traits are not necessarily under common genetic control (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>), so it should be possible for breeders to select varieties with high, stable yields by trialling their genotypes at a range of sites with diverse environmental conditions, particularly temperature in early winter.</p><p id="Par25">The reason that temperature during a short early winter time period has a major association with yield in winter rapeseed remains unclear. Previously it has been suggested that cold periods could supress the effects of pests or pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, but no specific effect has been proposed, and such a theory does not explain why cold only in this period has the yield-promoting effect, rather than cold later in winter. In our view these effects are unlikely to be mediated by agronomy, because RL trials are always substantially superior in agronomy and yield outcomes than commercial farms, yet are subject to similar inter-annual yield instability. In wheat the winter NAO has been shown to be associated with grain quality, including specific weight and Hagberg Falling Number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Thus winter weather is known to have strong associations with yield and grain quality components in other species.</p><p id="Par26">In Europe it has been predicted that climate change will affect rapeseed growth by limiting water availability, particularly in France, Germany and the United Kingdom by 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Our study shows that extremes of warmth in December are also impacting farm incomes, and further work will be required to understand how future variation in December temperatures in Europe will affect WOSR crop values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par27">Our study shows that temperature variation in late autumn and early winter is associated with yield instability in WOSR harvests in the United Kingdom, with lower temperatures between 27<sup>th</sup> November and 21<sup>st</sup> December correlated with higher crop yields at harvest. Further work is required to determine if this is due to the effects of weather on crop development, or on other factors that may influence WOSR yield. Warmer temperatures can also negatively affect semi-winter rapeseed yields in some regions of China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, so the implications of this study may impact other oilseed rape growing regions with unreliable winter chill. Further work will be needed to uncover whether yield variation is likely to known chilling responses in winter annuals, such as vernalisation requirement, play a role in this yield variation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Jenna Watts of the UK Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board for her assistance with obtaining yield data.
