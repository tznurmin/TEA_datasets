In this study, we found that PKM2 was highly expressed in patients with ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer (CRC). We then investigated the effectiveness of conditionally ablating PKM2 in Lgr5<sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cells (ISC) using a mouse model of colitis-associated CRC (AOM plus DSS). Tamoxifen-inducible Lgr5-driven deletion of PKM2 in ISC (PKM2<sup>ΔLgr5</sup>-Tx) significantly promoted tumor incidence and size in the colon and lower body weight compared with findings in vehicle-treated mice (PKM2<sup>ΔLgr5</sup>-Veh). Histopathologic analysis revealed considerable high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in the colon of PKM2<sup>ΔLgr5</sup>-Tx mice while PKM2<sup>ΔLgr5</sup>-Veh mice had low- and high-grade dysplasia. Loss of PKM2 was associated with dominant expression of PKM1 in Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC and their progeny cells. Further, the organoid-forming efficiency of whole cancer cells or Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells obtained from colon polyps of PKM2<sup>ΔLgr5</sup>-Tx mice was significantly increased when compared with PKM2<sup>ΔLgr5</sup>-Veh mice. Cancer organoids from PKM2<sup>ΔLgr5</sup>-Tx mice exhibited increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and a shift of metabolites involved in energy metabolism. These findings suggest that loss of PKM2 function in ISC promotes colitis-associated CRC.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_42707.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Pyruvate kinase (PK) is involved in the final step of glycolysis by transferring the phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP and producing pyruvate and ATP. It has four isozymes (L, R, M1, and M2), which exhibit different kinetic properties at the expressing tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Among them, the M2 isoform of PK (PKM2) has received the most attention due to its involvement in the Warburg effect in cancer. Most cancer cells utilize aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, to facilitate the synthesis of cellular building blocks (amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Previous studies suggested that PKM2 is a key glycolytic enzyme that is involved in aerobic glycolysis and anabolic metabolism in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Lower activity of PKM2 in tumor cells, which exists in a dimeric form, could allow the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates to enter the glycolysis branch pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In addition to its metabolic function, PKM2 can promote transcriptional activities through interactions with Oct-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, HIF-1α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, STAT3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and β-catenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These PKM2 functions might support metabolic reprogramming and progression of cancer.</p><p id="Par3">Although the critical role of PKM2 in cancer development is well known, recent studies have yielded conflicting results about the requirement for PKM2. Loss of PKM2 in a mouse model of breast cancer resulted in accelerated tumor growth and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In another study, knockdown of PKM2 led to impairment of tumor cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and had no effect on <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor xenograft growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, a recent study showed that depletion of PKM2 did not affect c-MYC-induced liver tumor formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These results challenge the idea that PKM2 is essential in tumorigenesis.</p><p id="Par4">PKM2 is the dominant isoform in normal colon tissues and is overexpressed in tumor-induced colon tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Also, PKM2 levels in serum and feces were elevated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Patients with IBD, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC).

Despite its elevation in IBD and CRC, the exact role of PKM2 in pathogenesis remains to be determined.</p><p id="Par5">Intestinal epithelium undergoes continuous cell renewal throughout adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The self-renewing of intestinal epithelium is mediated by intestinal stem cells (ISC), which exist at the base of intestinal crypts.

To elucidate which factors are involved in UC, we performed genomic analysis of previously reported gene expression data [GSE14580, GSE36807, and GSE47908; Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) in the National Center for Biotechnology Information]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. To explore for genes differentially expressed in UC, we compared normal colon to UC samples by applying class comparison analysis. We found 893 genes that were potentially UC correlated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). As expected, since UC is highly correlated with inflammation, genes (MMPs, CXCLs, STATs, and IL-8) associated with inflammation were significantly up-modulated in UC patients. Genes involved in glycolysis such as PFKFB3, PKM, and PFKP were highly increased in UC patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Previous reports demonstrate that PFKFB3 is associated with UC and CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, there has been little characterization of the function of PKM in inflammation-induced CRC. We thus focused on PKM function in UC and CRC. First, we examined PKM expression in the colon tissues of CRC patients. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, PKM expression in those tissues was significantly higher than in normal tissue. We next investigated the clinical relevance of PKM and CRC. Patient cohorts from the GEO were dichotomized according to PKM expression. Patients with higher PKM levels had poor clinical outcomes and vice versa across multiple sample sets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), consistent with an oncogenic function of PKM in CRC. Others have reported that PKM2 is the predominant isoform in normal colon epithelial cells and colon cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We also found that mRNA levels of PKM2, but not PKM1, were highly expressed in both human normal and cancer colon tissues (data not shown). Thus, we can speculate that PKM from gene expression profile data represent PKM2 rather than PKM1. To determine whether PKM2 expression is changed during inflammation and colon oncogenesis, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to validate expression of PKM2 in UC and CRC. Indeed, PKM2 expression was increased in UC tissues and greater yet in dysplastic tumors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Moreover, in CRC patients, the expression of Lgr5, the cancer stem cell marker, was positively correlated with PKM expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). These results suggest that PKM2 expression is increased during inflammation-induced CRC development, either as a consequence of oncogenic transformation or as a metabolic oncogene.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>PKM2 expression and clinical implication in ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC).

This discrepancy might be related to the fact that cancer organoids were in relatively higher glucose culture conditions than the cancer tissues, which were in low-glucose tumor microenvironment conditions.

In addition, cancer tissues elevate some intermediates in the pentose phosphate pathway. In another recent study, downregulated PKM2 resulted in an increase of the NADPH/NADP ratio in pancreatic cancer cells during hypo-glucose conditions, suggestive of activation of the pentose phosphate pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

Dehydrated tissues were then embedded in frozen section compound, frozen, and sliced into 6-μm sections. Tissue sections were fixed with −20 °C acetone for 5 min, blocked with PBS containing 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature (RT), and stained with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were washed in PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies at RT for 1 h, stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Fisher) for 2 min at RT, and mounted with PermaFluor mountant (Thermo Fisher). For staining, organoids seeded in an eight-well chamber (Thermo Fisher) were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min at RT. After organoids were washed in PBS and subsequently permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min at RT, they were blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT. After staining, images were captured on an LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-PKM1 (clone D30G6), rabbit anti-PKM2 (clone D78A4), rat anti-Ki67 (clone 11F6), and mouse anti-β-catenin (clone 14). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 546 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa fluor 594 goat anti-rat IgG.

After collection of supernatant, H<sub>2</sub>O was added and centrifuged. For metabolomics analysis, organoids were washed and lysed using cold methanol/H<sub>2</sub>O (80/20, v/v) by vigorous vortexing, and then centrifuged. Aqueous phase samples were dried by vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted with 50% methanol. Metabolites were analyzed with an liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system equipped with a 1290 high-performance liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), Qtrap 5500 (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA), and reverse-phase column (Synergi fusion RP 50 × 2 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Multiple reaction monitoring was used in negative-ion mode and the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) corresponding to the specific transition for each metabolite was used for quantitation. The area under the curve of the EIC was normalized to that of the EIC of the internal standard. The peak area ratio of each metabolite to internal standard was normalized using the protein concentration or the weight of each sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Measurement of OCR by XF24 Flux Analyzer</title><p id="Par27">Organoids were dissociated with TrypLE Express for 10 min at 37 °C.
