In this study, the intracellular activities of the NZ2114 derivative peptide H18R (H2) against methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant bovine <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains were investigated in bovine mammary epithelial MAC-T cells and mouse mammary glands. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of H2 against <italic>S. aureus</italic> were 0.5‒1 μg/ml; H2 displayed a lower cytotoxicity than its parental peptide NZ2114 (survival rates of MAC-T cells: 100% [H2 treatment] vs 60.7% [NZ2114 (256 μg/ml) treatment]). H2 was internalized into MAC-T cells mainly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and distributed in the cytoplasm. The intracellular inhibition rates against MRSA ATCC43300, the mastitis isolates <italic>S. aureus</italic> CVCC 3051 and E48 were above 99%, 99%, and 94%, respectively; these were higher than those in case of vancomycin (23–47%). In the mouse model of <italic>S. aureus</italic> E48-induced mastitis, after treatment with 100 μg of H2 and vancomycin, bacterial numbers in each mammary gland were reduced by 3.96- and 1.59-log CFU, respectively. Additionally, similar to NZ2114 and vancomycin, H2 alleviated the histopathological damage of the mammary tissue and polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration in the alveoli. These results suggest that H2 can be used as a safe and effective candidate for treating <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced mastitis.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.31672456, No.31872393, No. 31572445, 31372346, No.31572444, and No.31601968), the Project of the National Support Program for Science and Technology in China (No. 2013BAD10B02), and the AMP Direction of National Innovation Program of Agricultural Science and Technology in CAAS (CAAS-ASTIP-2013-FRI-02, 2013&amp;amp;#x2013;2017), and its Key Project of Alternatives to Antibiotics for Feed Usages (Grant CAAS-ZDXT2018008).</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_44459.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="AuthorContribution"><p>Xiao Wang and Da Teng contributed equally.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">As an opportunistic pathogen with a broad range of hosts, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> can lead to the acute and chronic infections in humans or farm animals worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>; bovine mastitis is one of the most serious concerns with regards to milk production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In China, the average incidence rate of bovine mastitis is about 33%; it leads to annual economic losses of ¥15–45 billion, which seriously affects the development of the dairy industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, accumulating evidences have demonstrated that <italic>S. aureus</italic> can internalize into host cells, such as mammary gland epithelial cells, and form an intracellular pathogen pool, which destroys the epithelial barrier and causes further damages, finally leading to the recurrence of bovine mastitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Although antibiotic therapy is a common method to eliminate intracellular <italic>S. aureus</italic> reservoirs in bovine mastitis-infected tissues, they have a low treatment efficiency and are associated with a high infection recurrence rate due to their low permeation ability in mammary glands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, the overuse of antibiotics in developing countries can trigger a series of serious problems, such as the destruction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and immune function in mammary glands, as well as enhanced bacterial resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In a recent investigation in China, among 219 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains those were isolated from bovine mastitis cases from six provinces (Beijing, Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Zhejiang), more than 70% showed resistance to various antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains isolated from mastitis-infected samples in other countries such as North and South America, Asia, and Malta, have been reported to be resistant to different antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find effective antibiotic alternatives for the treatment of bovine mastitis.</p><p id="Par4">Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising antibiotic alternative candidates, owing to their multiple modes of action such as membrane permeabilization, binding to DNA, and inhibition of protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The first fungal defensin-plectasin, isolated from <italic>Pseudoplectania nigrella</italic>, displays a potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria including <italic>S. aureus</italic> by binding to the cell wall precursor-lipid II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Both NZ2114 (D9N, M13L, and Q14R) and MP1102 (D9Q, M13V, and Q14R), which are derivatives of plectasin, have a stronger activity than their parent; this may be due to their more positive net charges and higher hydrophobicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, similar to daptomycin and vancomycin, NZ2114 and MP1102 display a potent intracellular activity against <italic>S. aureus</italic> in THP-1 monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, RAW 264.7 macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and mammary epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and can reduce the <italic>S. aureus</italic> load in the mammary glands of mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, NZ2114 and MP1102 are more toxic towards mouse macrophages than vancomycin due to their high hydrophobicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, in our previous study, H2 (H18R), a novel NZ2114-derived peptide, was designed by replacing the histidine at position 16 with arginine to reduce its cytotoxicity; the results showed that H2 almost retained its original antibacterial activity against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and showed high stability in different environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Analysis of the preliminary mechanisms of drug internalization by using different endocytosis inhibitors showed that the internalization of H2 and NZ2114 was mainly blocked by low temperature and chlorpromazine (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C,D</xref>).

Accordingly, it was deduced that H2 and NZ2114 can enter MAC-T cells mainly in an energy- and temperature-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In this work, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the major route of internalization of peptides in MAC-T cells, which is different from the case for certain cell-penetrating peptides (such as Tat11, α1H and α2H)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and NZ2114, which were internalized in RAW264.7 cells by both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis, and from the entry of polyhexamethylene biguanide into cells, which occurs via dynamin-dependent endocytic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

Additionally, in order to investigate the efficiency of H2, in this study, the mouse mastitis model was treated with a lower dose (100 μg per mammary gland) of H2 than that in previous studies (100–1200 μg per mammary gland).

The lower efficiency of vancomycin <italic>in vivo</italic> may be associated with the presence of body fluids such as milk and serum, which may reduce the antibacterial activity of drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, after treatment with the peptides or vancomycin, polymorphonuclear neutrophils disappeared from the alveoli (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), which is consistent with the findings from previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Meanwhile, no obvious damage to the bacterial cells was found following treatment with the peptides and vancomycin in mammary cells and tissues, indirectly revealing that NZ2114 and H2 have no toxicity at the concentration of 100 μg/gland. This indicated that the plectasin-derived peptide H2 is more promising for use as a topical injection than in transitional therapy for bovine mastitis. Additionally, in some previous studies, it has been demonstrated that the synthetic peptide Bac2A (RLARIVVIRVAR), which is derived from bovine bactenecin, displays potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (MICs of 0.25–16 μg/ml); meanwhile, it has minor effects on host immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, making it appealing as a therapeutic alternative to antibiotics for mastitis treatment.
