Previous studies have revealed that the coronaviruses develop various strategies to evade the host innate immunity through the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. However, the ability of TGEV to inhibit the host innate immune response by modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway is not clear.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this study, a dual luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the inhibition of NF-κB by TGEV infection and to identify the major viral proteins involved in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify the mRNA expression of inflammatory factors. The deubiquitination of Nsp3 domains and its effect on IκBα and p65 were analyzed by western blotting. The ubiquitination level of IκBα was analyzed by immunoprecipitation.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In ST and IPEC-J2 cells, TGEV exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of NF-κB activity. Individual TGEV protein screening revealed the high potential of non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) to inhibit NF-κB signaling, and leading to the downregulation of the NF-κB-induced cytokine production. We demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of Nsp3 was mainly mediated through the suppression of IκBα degradation as well as the inhibition of p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the amino acid residues at positions 590–1,215 in Nsp3 were demonstrated to inhibit the degradation of IκBα by inhibiting the IκBα ubiquitination.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">TGEV infection can inhibit the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is mainly mediated by Nsp3 through the canonical pathway. The amino acid residues at positions 590–1,215 in Nsp3 compose the critical domain that mediates NF-κB inhibition. We speculate that this inhibitory effect is likely to be related to the structure of PLP2 with deubiquitinating enzyme activity of the amino acid residues at positions 590–1,215 in Nsp3. Our study provides a better understanding of the TGEV-mediated innate immune modulation and lays the basis for studies on the pathogenesis of coronavirus.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group

gastroenteritis (TGE), an acute swine enteric disease, is caused by the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Pigs that are infected with TGEV usually present symptoms such as vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhea. Among the piglets aged less than 2 weeks old, the mortality rate of TGEV infection is as high as 100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Globally, TGE causes enormous economic loss to the swine industry. TGEV was first identified in the United States in 1946 as an etiological agent of TGE in swine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. TGEV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 28.6 kb. The virus belongs to the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> in the order Nidovirales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The virus genome comprises 5′-untranslated region (UTR), at least nine open reading frames,and 3′-UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. ORF1 comprises two ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins, respectively. The polyproteins are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-Nsp16) by the virus-encoded papain-like protease (PL pro) and 3C-like protease (3CL pro). These non-structural proteins have various functions in the viral life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">The host innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infections. Various transcription factors, such as interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) are activated during the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Among these transcription factors, NF-κB is the key regulator of the proinflammatory and antiviral responses. The NF-κB family comprises of five members: p65/RelA, RelB, cRel, p50, and p52. These transcription factors share an N-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain, which is known as the Rel homology domain. This domain plays a crucial role in the formation of homodimers and heterodimers. NF-κB dimers can bind to various target DNA sequences called κB sites and modulate the gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The canonical pathway for the activation of NF-κB has been extensively studied. The pathogen pattern recognition receptor on the cell surface recognizes various pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathogen molecules, resulting in the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is mediated by the IKKβ subunit. The phosphorylated IKKβ subunit phosphorylates the amino terminus of repressor IκB (mainly IκBα) at the Ser32 and Ser36 residues. Subsequently, repressor IκB is ubiquitinated and targeted for protein degradation by the proteolytic enzymes. The degradation of IκB exposes the nuclear localization signal (NLS), which promotes the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. NF-κB within the nucleus promotes the transcription of several chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Many viruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are known to activate the host innate immune response through NF-κB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the virus particles may still replicate and cause disease in vivo. This suggests that the virus employs various strategies to inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway for evading the host immune response. The Orf virus (ORFV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) can evade the antiviral innate immunity by inhibiting the NF-κB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additionally, some viruses, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), have a dual role in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As both PEDV and TGEV belong to the genus <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> within the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, we explored whether the effect of TGEV on NF-κB signaling is similar to that of PEDV. Our previous experimental results have demonstrated that TGEV infection can activate the NF-κB and induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via the NF-κB signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which concurred with the results of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, whether TGEV exerts an inhibitory effect on NF-κB signaling pathway is still unknown.</p><p id="Par32">In this study, we demonstrated that TGEV infection exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the NF-κB signaling pathway in both intestinal epithelial cell lines J2 (IPEC-J2) and swine testicular (ST) cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that Nsp3 was the key viral protein that is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling through the canonical pathway and in the suppression of NF-κB-induced cytokine production. The amino acids at positions 590–1,215 in Nsp3 play a critical role in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling by inhibiting IκBα ubiquitination as well as the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65. These effects appear to be related to the papain-like protease 2 (PLP2), which is located between amino acids at positions 606 and 901. Our findings provide useful insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of coronavirus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Viruses, cells, and reagents</title><p id="Par33">Intestinal epithelial cell lines J2 (IPEC-J2) and HEK-293 T, were available in our laboratory.

The antiviral effect of poly(I:C) against TGEV was evaluated by treating the IPEC-J2 cells with poly(I:C) for 12 h before inoculation with the TGEV.

Although poly(I:C) inhibited TGEV replication in the cells, the virus could not be completely inactivated.

These results indicate that Nsp3 can induce deubiquitination and that the amino acids at positions 590–1,215 in Nsp3 may inhibit the degradation of IκBα by decreasing the IκBα ubiquitination levels, which results in the suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Nsp3 causes deubiquitination and Nsp3 (590–1215 aa) can inhibit the ubiquitination level of IκBα. <bold>a</bold> HA-tagged ubiquitin eukaryotic expression plasmid (pCMV-HA-Ub) and the Myc-tagged Nsp3, or its truncated gene fragments, were co-transfected into the IPEC-J2 cells or HEK-293 T cells.

The NF-κB signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the innate immune response regulatory network and is highly active during viral infections. This pathway activates the transcription of genes encoding several cytokines and chemokines, which are involved in the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A variety of viruses evade the host immune response by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. Earlier studies have reported that SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 can impair NF-κB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Similarly, the ORF4b-encoded accessory protein (p4b) of MERS-CoV is known to facilitate innate immune evasion by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, knowledge regarding the signal transduction mechanisms of host cells after TGEV infection is incomplete.</p><p id="Par48">Our earlier study revealed that infection with TGEV can activate the NF-κB signaling pathway in both ST and IPEC-J2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, we used poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), to induce an innate immune response via the activation of NF-κB signaling. This strategy enabled the detection of NF-κB signaling pathway inhibition post-TGEV infection. Our results indicated that TGEV infection inhibited NF-κB activity and that this inhibitory effect can be correlated with infection time and inoculum titer in both ST and IPEC-J2 cells.</p><p id="Par49">As proteins are the ultimate performers of biological functions, we examined the TGEV proteins that play an important role in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling. As the transfection efficiency in ST cells was low, we chose HEK-293 T and IPEC-J2 cells for subsequent experiments. The dual luciferase reporter assay analysis revealed that all TGEV proteins, except Nsp2, can inhibit the NF-κB pathway to varying degrees. However, the inhibitory effect of Nsp1 and Nsp3 on NF-κB signaling was higher than that of other TGEV proteins. Further, we explored the underlying mechanisms of Nsp1-mediated NF-κB pathway inhibition. Unfortunately, the expression level of the Nsp1 plasmid was too low in the HEK-293 T and IPEC-J2 cells to complete our analysis. Hence, we only demonstrate the mechanism of action of TGEV Nsp3 in inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.</p><p id="Par50">The multi-domain Nsp3 protein is the largest protein encoded by the coronavirus genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Several studies have reported that Nsp3 of coronavirus can inhibit multiple signaling pathways. Nsp3 of MHV-A59 can inactivate IRF 3 and consequently inhibit type I IFN response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Similarly, PEDV Nsp3 was reported to be an NF-κB antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. SARS Nsp3 is reported to bind to the viral or host cell RNA and regulate the viral replication and evade the immune response of the infected host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. TGEV is a typical α-type coronavirus. However, the role of TGEV Nsp3 in the regulation of NF-κB signaling is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that Nsp3 can inhibit the NF-κB activation and that the inhibitory effect was positively correlated with the expression level of Nsp3.</p><p id="Par51">In most cells, NF-κB complexes are inactive and predominantly reside in the cytoplasm in a complex with inhibitory IκB proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Upon activation of the signaling pathways, the IκB protein is degraded and the NF-κB dimers enter the nucleus to modulate the expression of target genes. NF-κB signaling pathway is activated through the canonical or noncanonical pathway and depends on the phosphorylation-induced ubiquitination of IκB proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the expression of IκBα and p65 in the HEK-293 T and IPEC-J2 cells transfected with Nsp3. We observed that Nsp3 could dose-dependently inhibit IκBα degradation, as well as the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65. Thus, our data demonstrated that TGEV Nsp3 can suppress the NF-κB signaling through the canonical pathway.</p><p id="Par52">NF-κB signaling is a central pathway that regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that NF-κB is essential in priming inflammasome activation for the production of cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Several viral proteins play an important role in the regulation of inflammation via NF-κB signaling. The HBeAg protein of HBV suppresses the lipopolysaccharide-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1b production via the inhibition of NF-κB phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Similarly, BVDV infection was reported to trigger NF-κB signaling and enhance IL-8 transcription, as the transcription level was observed to be markedly increased after the viral infection, and the immediate early response 3 (IER3) was also reported to inhibit NF-κB activity and downregulate IL-8 expression by approximately 65% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Our experimental results indicated that Nsp3 can downregulate the expression of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α through the inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway. These results suggest that Nsp3 plays a vital role in the TGEV-mediated inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.</p><p id="Par53">The domains of Nsp3 involved in the degradation of IκBα and phosphorylation of p65 was examined using the SMART database to predict the possible functional domains of Nsp3. Nsp3 was truncated into four fragments without affecting its original functional domain, and the truncated genes were screened with a dual luciferase assay. The two truncated gene fragments, Nsp3 (1–418 aa) and Nsp3 (590–1,215 aa) strongly inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway, with the inhibitory effect of Nsp3 (590–1,215 aa) being significantly higher than that of Nsp3 (1–418 aa). The SMART database predicted that both Nsp3 (1–418 aa) and Nsp3 (590–1,215 aa) contain PLPs (154–406 and 606–901 aa). PLPs exhibit deubiquitinating activity, removing the ubiquitin moiety from the signaling molecule in the innate antiviral pathway to inhibit the host innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Coronavirus PLPs are reported to be the suppressors of innate immune response. SARS-CoV PLP inhibits IFN induction and NF-κB signaling pathways by regulating the activation of important signaling proteins in the IRF3 and NF-κB signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Similarly, HCoV-NL63 uses PLPs to evade the innate antiviral response of the host through the inhibition of p53-IRF7-IFNβ signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We hypothesized that Nsp3 may utilize the deubiquitination effects of PLP to inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway by suppressing IκBα ubiquitination. Our results demonstrated that Nsp3 (590–1,215 aa) had markedly deubiquitination activity in the HEK-293 T and IPEC-J2 cells, so Nsp3(590–1,215aa) was used to verify our hypothesis. Consistent with our expected, the amino acid residues at positions 590–1,215 of Nsp3 can inhibit the degradation of IκBα by reducing its ubiquitination level. This phenomenon is likely associated with the deubiquitinating enzyme activity of PLP2, which exists within Nsp3 amino acid residues 606–901.</p><p id="Par54">Previous studies have demonstrated that TGEV infection can activate the NF-κB signaling pathway by inducing the degradation of IκBα, and the degradation of IκBα is mainly caused by ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These results indicated that the level of IκBα ubiquitination was not decreased in TGEV-infected cells. Hence, it can be presumed that deubiquitination effects of IκBα that is induced by Nsp3 could not inhibit the activation of NF-κB completely during TGEV infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par55">TGEV infection was demonstrated to inhibit the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in both ST and IPEC-J2 cells. Moreover, our results indicate that TGEV Nsp3 inhibits NF-κB signaling through the canonical pathway. However, whether Nsp3 simultaneously affects both NF-κB signaling pathway and other pathways warrants further study. The amino acid residues at positions 590–1,215 in Nsp3 have the ability to inhibit the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 by inhibiting the ubiquitination of IκBα. We speculate that this may be due to the presence of a PLP2 domain with deubiquitinating enzyme activity at amino acid residue positions 590–1,215 in Nsp3. Our study provides a better understanding of the TGEV-mediated innate immune modulation and lays the basis for future studies on the pathogenesis of coronavirus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>LW and YL conceived and designed the study.
