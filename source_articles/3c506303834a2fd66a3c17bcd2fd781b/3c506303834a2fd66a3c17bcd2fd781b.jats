These phenotypes are of particular concern in persistent and relapsing infections, since cells resume to normal growth after cessation of the stressful condition. In this context, we found persisters and unstable SCVs as phenotypic variants of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> that were able to survive ciprofloxacin exposure. A high heterogeneity in persister levels was observed among <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> isolates grown under planktonic and biofilm conditions and exposed to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime, which may indicate persistence as a non-multidrug-tolerant phenotype. Nevertheless, a comparable variability was not found in the formation of SCVs among the isolates. Indeed, similar proportions of SCV in relation to normal colony phenotype (NCP) were maintained even after three successive cycles of ciprofloxacin exposure testing colonies from both origins (SCV or NCP). Additionally, we found filamentous and dividing cells in the same scanning electron microscopy images from both SCV and NCP. These findings lead us to hypothesize that besides variability among isolates, a single isolate may generate distinct populations of persisters, where cells growing under distinct conditions may adopt different and perhaps complementary survival strategies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Coordena&amp;amp;#x00E7;&amp;amp;#x00E3;o de

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> comprises pathogens adapted to infect and survive inside human and animal epithelial and phagocytic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, including some non-host adapted serovars that are among the most important zoonotic pathogens worldwide. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> infection can result in diseases that range from gastroenteritis to enteric fevers. In the midst of this scenario, millions of foodborne outbreaks caused by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> are reported every year, wherein the majority are due to consumption of food derived from animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Enteric fevers are life-threatening febrile illnesses requiring antibiotic therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and fluoroquinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, are the chosen drugs. However, fluoroquinolones block DNA replication by inhibiting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and are not suitable to treat infections in children and pregnant women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, in those cases, the treatment is performed using third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftazidime, whose mechanism of action is the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Most <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> serovars are able to adhere to abiotic surfaces and persist in the environment for long periods, especially when growing as biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In fact, biofilms are recognized as major contributors to food processing cross-contamination due to the difficulty in removing them from contaminated surfaces. This makes them an important public health concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, biofilms can also prevent antimicrobial diffusion and block the entry of immune system components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, the higher bacterial survival levels in biofilms could be explained by the presence of persister cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, a non-heritable phenotype that comprises a small subpopulation of cells derived from an isogenic bacterial culture, which displays high antibiotic tolerance by entering in a transient slow or non-growth state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. It is postulated that all bacteria can form persisters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, including <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, as well as archaea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and fungi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Persister cells can be stochastically formed in a microbial population, or induced by stressors such as antimicrobials. Indeed, persisters can survive exposure even to high levels of bactericidal antibiotics without undergoing any genetic change, unlike drug resistant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, eradication of persisters has become a challenge to avoid recurrent treatment failures and recalcitrance of chronic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Molecular mechanisms behind persister cell formation have been studied, but they have not yet been fully elucidated. The trigger for persisters phenotype formation may involve a down or up-regulation of molecules related to stringent response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, energy production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, phosphate metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, SOS response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, acting whether alone or overlapped<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. <italic>Salmonella</italic> may form persisters in host macrophages when induced by vacuolar acidification and nutritional deprivation, and TA systems are presumed to be responsible for this microorganism’s physiological state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Another phenotypic switching found in response to harsh environments are the small colony variants (SCV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. SCVs are characterized as slow-growing cells forming pin-prick-sized colonies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> that can revert to wild-type-like colonies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, or even be stably kept<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, which enable survival to diverse environmental pressures, such as antimicrobial exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and intracellular host defense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, isogenic bacterial populations may present heterogeneous phenotypes such as persisters and SCVs.</p><p id="Par5">We found persisters and unstable SCVs as phenotypic variants of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> that were able to survive ciprofloxacin exposure. In addition, a high heterogeneity in the levels of persisters was observed among <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> isolates cultured under planktonic and biofilm conditions after ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime exposure, therefore not indicating persistence as a multidrug-tolerant phenotype. However, a similar variability was not found in the proportion of SCVs formed among the isolates, which was maintained even after successive treatments. Importantly scanning electron microscopy analysis allowed us to observe division septum and filamentous cells from both SCV and normal colony phenotype (NCP) images. Thus, our findings contribute to the characterization of these adaptive strategies to survive stressful environments, and may help to explain treatment failure and relapsing infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bacterial isolates</title><p id="Par6"><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> isolated between 1995 and 2012 from poultry by-product meals, poultry carcass, food, porcine faeces and food handler in Southern Brazil were used in this study as follows: <italic>Salmonella</italic> Schwarzengrund (n = 1), <italic>Salmonella</italic> Agona (n = 2), <italic>Salmonella</italic>.

It is important to highlight that the planktonic cells evaluated here were from a mid-exponential phase, since levels of persisters from bacterial cells growing in a stationary phase have been described as similar to or even higher than those found in biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Bacteria growing in biofilms can face stressful conditions related to persistence, such as starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, oxygen deprivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> and limited metabolic flux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, triggering a stringent response, which, in turn, may activates the SOS response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The SOS response allows survival after exposure to β-lactams and fluoroquinolone antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, and has been proposed as necessary for biofilm ofloxacin tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Quorum sensing had also been associated with persister formation in biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>; however, we found that both biofilm and planktonic cultures with higher initial densities did not have the highest persister levels (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>), which we had previously reported in <italic>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</italic>-<italic>baumannii</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Additionally, initial cell density, i.e., the population before antibiotic exposure, was higher in planktonic cultures than in biofilms. Therefore, we were not able to corroborate that quorum sensing is playing a major role in the generation of persisters in biofilms; once we detected up to a 10-fold variation in biofilm persister levels when initial cell densities were similar. Indeed, an important aspect to take into account is the physiological states of cells growing in different conditions, which would be involved with the ability to respond to stresses and transport substances across membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">In addition to isolates with distinct behaviours that are related to persister levels when exposed to different antimicrobials and/or cultured under different conditions, heterogeneity was observed among isolates facing a same situation, which highlights a wide individual variation in antimicrobial tolerance, as also described in other bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">Phenotypic switching to SCVs has also been recognized as a strategy for antimicrobial tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Here, we reported SCVs among persisters surviving after ciprofloxacin treatment in all <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> isolates, and a stable SCV phenotype was not found even in three consecutive cycles of ciprofloxacin exposure, regardless of whether the origin of the colony was small or normal, since all SCVs reverted to the wild-type-like phenotype when sub-cultured under stress-free conditions. This can indicate that SCVs, like persisters, represent a transient phenotype originating from stress responses and possibly coordinated by epigenetic changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we also confirmed that the formation of persisters in <italic>S. enterica</italic> is a non-heritable mechanism, since the fractions of persisters remained approximately the same during repeated cycles.</p><p id="Par30">All unstable SCVs we detected maintained the same ciprofloxacin MIC values of their ancestors, as already described in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, SCVs have been reported to be less susceptible to aminoglycosides and β-lactams antimicrobials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, especially in stable SCVs, which may be due to mutations in genes involved in pathways required for the antimicrobial actions independent of those involved in the small colony size phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">Despite the wide variation of persister levels found between the isolates, the ratios of SCV:total colonies were not different among them. Another important aspect to be highlighted was the detection of more SCVs in planktonic cultures than in biofilms, unlike what is usually found in persisters, which allow us to speculate that cells growing under distinct conditions may adopt different and perhaps complementary survival strategies. Nevertheless, no fluctuation in SCV rates among serovars could be seen, leading us to assume that serovars do not influence in SCV rates.</p><p id="Par32">We also investigated the cell morphology of cells forming SCVs and NCPs, since SCVs from <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. have been described as cells with different sizes, smaller or larger, when compared to those of NCPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. However, we observed similar shapes and sizes when comparing all cells, regardless of the culture conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A,C,E,G</xref>). Nevertheless, filamentous cells were seen among cells forming both SCVs and NCPs. These have been reported in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> after exposure to ciprofloxacin due to the inhibition of cell division resulting from the induction of SOS response and raise of DNA-repair capability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. In opposite, several cells showed septum division, which lead us to suggest that different behaviours can be found among cells forming distinct colonies morphologies, where cells may exhibit metabolic activity at different levels resulting in different growing speeds.</p><p id="Par33">Both SCV and persisters are thought to be part of a bacterial bet-hedging strategy for the survival under stress. So, could SCVs comprise a phenotypic variant of persisters characterized by slow growth? If we consider these phenotypes as independent variants in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> that randomly generate unstable SCV regardless of antibiotic exposure, we should also have found SCV after exposure to ceftazidime, which did not happen. Can we postulate that the diversity of strategies may be greater or that there is an overlap of physiological strategies depending on the challenging stress? Thus, elucidating the mechanisms involved in phenotypic switching of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> isolates in an isogenic population is essential for the development of methods for an effective treatment of chronic infections, which may be of special concern in infections caused by invasive <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the laboratory technicians for preparing materials, and to the Central Laboratory of Microscopy and Microanalysis (LabCEMM) for preparing and assisting in the interpretation of microscopic analyses.
