id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par18">Termites are social cockroaches, a monophyletic clade nested within the Blattodea, that evolved eusociality more than 150 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Termites live in complex societies that are characterized by a caste system in which few individuals (reproductives including a queen and a king) reproduce, while the large majority (non-reproductives, including workers and soldiers) perform tasks such as foraging, brooding and defence. The reproductive division of labour, with overlapping generations and cooperative brood care, is one of the major evolutionary transitions in termite biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which leads to the rapid development of termite colonies. Recent findings demonstrate that termite nests can increase the robustness of dryland ecosystems to climatic change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Lower termites are characterized by a unique flexibility in development. The worker’s potential to differentiate into neotenic reproductives (replacement reproductives) remains one of the great mysteries of termite biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The diverse and flexible breeding systems found in termites pre-adapt them to invade new or marginal habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the genus <italic>Reticulitermes</italic>, caste differentiation bifurcates into two pathways: the nymphal (sexual imaginal) pathway, which develops into reproductives (alate adults as primary reproductives and brachypterous neotenic reproductives), and the apterous pathway, which leads to workers and soldiers. Reproductives and soldiers die without workers’ help, and all soldiers are sterile. However, workers have unique flexibility in that a worker has the capability to develop into apterous neotenic reproductives that develop in the absence of reproductives to provide for continued growth of the colony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The female workers are not able to produce mature eggs unless they moult into conspicuous reproductive females, whereas the male workers can copulate with queens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Strikingly, workers can exploit new food resources outside the natal nest and will move to a new nest site when food supplies are low, and then the reproductive development of the female worker can be triggered in the new nest site (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The reproductive plasticity of workers provides colonies with tremendous flexibility to respond to environmental changes and the deterioration of the nest and food resources. Therefore, this caste system of termites is considered to be the basis for their evolutionary and ecological success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

The workers exploited new food resources outside the natal nest and moved to a new nest site. The differentiation of female workers into NRs was triggered in the new nest site. <bold>b</bold> In the laboratory, A group of workers from their natal colony was isolated in a Petri dish with moist sawdust. After 4 weeks, the NRs appeared in the group of isolated workers, indicating that a new colony was created.

Differences in the complex traits among castes are not the result of the presence or absence of particular genes but arise from changes in the mechanisms of gene regulation affecting when and where a gene or an entire regulatory module is expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The transition of workers into reproductives is caused by specific gene expression that depends on environmental and social stimuli. Current evidence demonstrates that chemical communication by a queen prevents the development of worker reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The worker caste is seen as a neuter caste whose sexual development is suppressed due to counterbalanced maternal and paternal imprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A group of above 12 isolated workers from their natal colony of <italic>Reticulitermes</italic> can produce a female reproductive after 4 weeks, and then a new colony is founded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In termite caste differentiation, the differentiation of the workers into reproductives may be the most difficult process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], in which the specific expression of genes is induced. However, this specific expression profile remains unclear.</p><p id="Par21">In the present study, to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the reproductive plasticity of workers, we induced the female workers that transformed into reproductives by using the groups of isolated workers of <italic>R. labralis</italic>, and then sequenced the transcriptomes of individuals at three stages: female workers in natal colonies in which there were queens, isolated female workers from their natal colonies (IWs) and female neotenic reproductives (NRs) differentiated from isolated workers. First, we identified transcripts undergoing significant abundance changes during worker development into reproductives and identified 38,070 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, including upregulated and downregulated genes). Second, we found a pattern of gene expression involved in the differentiation of workers into reproductives by a trend analysis of the DEGs enrichment. Third, 25 signal transduction pathways classified into environmental information processing were involved in the differentiation of workers into NRs in the absence of queens, and then we performed qRT-PCR analysis of five Ras signalling pathway-related genes. Lastly, the differential expression of the Catalase gene related to longevity were found in the female workers, isolated workers and NRs. This is the first comprehensive study on the gene expression of differentiation of workers into reproductives.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Morphological changes of the workers developing into neotenic reproductives</title><p id="Par22">The differentiation of neotenic reproductives (NRs) was induced by isolating late instar workers of <italic>R. labralis</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The abdomen length significantly increased after the female workers moulted into NRs. The heads of the female NRs had brown pigmentation stripes. No male NRs emerged in experimental colonies. Moreover, the ovaries of the workers produced degenerate follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the ovaries of the workers, a conspicuous feature was that each oocyte was surrounded by a thin layer of follicle cells in which the elongated follicle cells were degenerated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f).

All colony members share the same genetic background, and differences in the caste are caused by differences in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this study, we identified genes that were specifically overexpressed in isolated female workers (IWs) of <italic>R. labralis</italic>. Of 17,405 DEGs, 16,910 (97.2%) genes were upregulated in IWs compared with that of workers in natal colonies. After isolated workers developed into reproductives, most of the DEGs (27,741, 91.5%) were downregulated. These results confirmed that the isolated workers had the most distinctive gene-expression pattern, with the vast majority of genes were being specifically overexpressed in the absence of queens. Therefore, we suggest that when workers leave the natal colony or a queen dies, the expression of stage-specific genes is induced in workers, which leads to the differentiation of workers to reproductives.</p><p id="Par37">We confirm that profile 5 of the DEGs shows a pattern of gene expression that is involved in the differentiation of the workers to reproductives. In this study, although the 38,070 DEGs from the workers in natal colonies, IWs and NRs of <italic>R. labralis</italic> were clustered into 8 profiles, only the expression of genes in profile 5(12,543 DEGs) were not detected or were very low in workers, and then were specifically upregulated in IWs and downregulated in NRs. Therefore, it is conceivable that the expression of genes in profile 5 in female workers was affected by the presence or absence of queens. The most surprising finding is that, according to the KEGG pathways analysis, five signal transduction pathways in profile 5 were classified into environmental information processing, which indicated that these signal transduction pathways were involved in the transition of workers into reproductives after the workers were isolated from their natal colonies.</p><p id="Par38">Our transcriptome analysis showed that a Ras gene was only expressed in IWs and was not detected in the workers and NRs. Moreover, the qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that the relative expression level of Ras in the IWs was 131-fold and 20-fold higher than that of the workers and NRs, respectively, which indicated that Ras was especially overexpressed in workers in the absence of queens. β-Subunit of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel Cav1.2 drives signaling to the nucleus via H-Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. All Ras biology occurs in membranes, and Ras genes act as molecular switches. Ras subfamily members work with certain membrane receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases. When these receptors accept extracellular signalling factors, such as hormones and growth factors, signalling cascades start via the phosphorylation of proteins. Ras acts as a switch in the middle of such signalling cascades to regulate downstream signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Chemical communication by a reproducing queen prevents worker reproduction in termite colonies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A queen-produced volatile pheromone consisting of n-butyl-n-butyrate and 2-methyl-1-butanol has been identified in <italic>R. speratus</italic>. This queen pheromone inhibits the differentiation of workers into neotenic reproductives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, the female workers transform into reproductives via moulting. Previous studies have confirmed that the activity of Ras in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> prothoracic gland induces precocious ecdysone release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Obviously, the signal of queen death combined with the receptor in workers can activate Ras on the cell membrane, and then Ras transmits the signal to the downstream pathway, which leads to the specific expression of genes. We suggest that Ras proteins are binary switches that cycle between ON and OFF states during the signal transduction of worker reproductive options.</p><p id="Par39">We infer that Ras stimulated the Ras-ERK MAPK signalling pathway to induce and promote the ovary growth of workers in the absence of queens. Ras is a key component of growth signalling pathways, because it functions as a relay switch between upstream growth receptors and downstream effector pathways, such as MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Gonadal development during the development of the workers into neotenic reproductives appears to be the most significant biological process that leads to the formation of caste-specific differences in tasks and statuses. In the termite <italic>R. speratus</italic>, the average size of the ovaries from all of the emerged female neotenic reproductives in isolated worker groups was significantly larger compared to females that retained their worker status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our previous study showed that the mean length and width of the ovaries of <italic>R. labralis</italic> increased 2.5-fold and 3-fold longer, respectively, during the differentiation of isolated workers into reproductives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Degeneration of the follicles in the workers was found, particularly, when compared with the nymphs. Degenerate follicle cells that fail to support further development of oocytes is an important reason for the absence of vitellogenesis during oogenesis in the workers, which is a leading cause of reduced fertility in the workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To survive and propagate, organisms must respond to changes in the environmental condition by altering their physiology and behaviour. Reproductive development is particularly well-tuned to changes in environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The germ line utilizes the well-conserved Ras-ERK signalling pathway in different contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, in the presence of food, the DAF-2 insulin-like receptor signals through the Ras-ERK pathway to drive meiotic prophase 1 progression and oogenesis; in the absence of food, the downregulation of the Ras-ERK pathway stalls oogenesis<sup>25</sup>. We found that, in the absence of queens, Ras and ERK genes had higher expression in workers, and the Ras-ERK signalling pathway axis regulated the gene oocyte meiosis pathway. Thus, we further conclude that “the absence of the queen pheromone” signals through activation of the Ras-ERK signalling pathway to drive the ovary development of isolated workers, and the Ras/MAPK signalling pathway axis regulates gene expression, proliferation and differentiation in the ovary.</p><p id="Par40">We found that as soon as an individual worker moulted into a reproductive, the CAT gene in the longevity regulation pathway was activated immediately, which indicated that longevity is related to the status of the individual termites. The trade-off between reproduction and longevity is known in wide variety of animals. Social insect queens are rare organisms that can achieve a long lifespan without sacrificing fecundity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Reproducing queens in termites can live for 20 years, whereas workers live only a few weeks to months. The queens and workers in a colony share the same genetic background, and differences in longevity are caused by differences in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the termite <italic>R. speratus</italic>, queens showed more than seven times higher expression levels of CAT genes than those of workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This efficient antioxidant system can partly explain why termite queens achieve a long life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In our study, after IWs molted into NRs, the expression level of the CAT gene was increased significantly, and the expression levels of the CAT gene in NRs were approximately 5-fold higher compared with that of IW. These results suggest that in termites, short-lived individuals (workers) can become long-lived individuals (queens), and the expression of longevity genes is influenced by the colony environment. Isolated workers face enormous environment stress because they need found new nests and resist pathogen and parasites. We found that the expression levels of the CAT gene decrease significantly in isolated workers compared with those of workers in natal colonies. Therefore,we suggest that the lifespan of workers decreases after leaving their natal colonies. This study provides an important model for revealing the molecular mechanism of longevity changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">We identified 38,070 differentially expressed genes and found profile 5 to be the pattern of gene expression involved in the differentiation of the workers into reproductives. 12,543 genes were specifically upregulated in the isolated workers.
