sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) catalyze the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, a conserved reaction that is fundamental to DNA-based life. As essential enzymes in central metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, RNRs have evolved two complex forms of allostery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>: specificity regulation, which is conserved in all RNRs, and activity regulation, which is canonically attributed only to RNRs with an evolutionarily mobile, regulatory domain known as the ATP-cone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In this study, we describe the unexpected emergence of a convergent form of activity regulation in the class Ib RNRs, a major subset of aerobic RNRs that lack ATP-cones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The evolution of class Ib RNRs is particularly relevant to medicine, as they are the primary aerobic RNRs used by a number of bacterial pathogens, such as <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Nearly all aerobic organisms use class I RNRs, which consist of two subunits: α, which contains the catalytic site (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), and β, which houses a subclass-dependent metal center (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Enzyme activity requires the coordination of three processes: radical generation, nucleotide reduction, and re-reduction of the catalytic site. The first step involves reversible, long-range (~35 Å) radical transfer (RT) from a stable tyrosyl radical cofactor in β to a central cysteine in the catalytic site of α (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). The flexible C-terminus of β plays a critical role in this process by binding to α and contributing a conserved tyrosine along the RT pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). Once the thiyl radical is generated in α, nucleotide reduction proceeds via a conserved mechanism using two additional redox-active cysteines in the catalytic site as reducing equivalents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The resulting disulfide is then reduced by a cysteine pair on the flexible C-terminus of α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1d</xref>). Because RT is required for turnover, the active class I RNR complex is generally thought to adopt a compact conformation similar to a previously proposed symmetric α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> docking model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). However, the structural basis for RNR activity has not yet been elucidated at high resolution.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Allosteric sites of the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> class Ib ribonucleotide reductase. <bold>a</bold> A 2.50 Å crystal structure of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> NrdE (α subunit) obtained under activating conditions depicts an S-shaped dimer (“S-dimer”) interfacing at the “specificity” or S-site (lavender).

Class I RNRs reduce ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDPs, where N is any of the four bases, A, U, C, or G), with additional enzymatic steps converting the dNDP products into dNTPs. Substrate preference is allosterically coupled to the binding of a dNTP in the specificity or S-site (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), thus ensuring the balance of dNTP pools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In class I RNRs, the S-site is located at the interface of a canonical α<sub>2</sub> dimer, hereafter denoted the “S-dimer” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Additionally, many RNRs from every class are able to regulate overall activity via a second allosteric site designated the activity or A-site (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). This site is housed in an evolutionarily mobile ~100-residue ATP-cone domain composed of a four-helix bundle and a three-stranded β-sheet cap, which is typically found at the N-terminus of the α subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, f</xref>). Binding of the substrate derivative ATP increases activity, while the downstream product, dATP, acts as a feedback inhibitor.</p><p id="Par6">Most class I RNRs are classified into two subgroups on the basis of the radical-generating cofactor. Class Ia RNRs (NrdA = α, NrdB = β) are found in all domains of life and utilize a diferric tyrosyl cofactor. In contrast, class Ib RNRs (NrdE = α, NrdF = β) employ a dimanganic tyrosyl cofactor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and are thought to have evolved from a Ia progenitor as a secondary aerobic RNR in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Studies of class Ia RNRs have shown that ATP-cone domains preferentially interface with other RNR chains (α or β) upon binding of dATP to form ring-shaped oligomers that are proposed to inhibit activity by preventing long-range RT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Whereas most class Ia RNRs have at least one ATP-cone, class Ib RNRs are notable for sharing a characteristic truncated ATP-cone sequence at the N-terminus of α (NrdE) and for lacking key A-site residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>, orange). Consistent with this, class Ib RNRs have generally shown a lack of activity regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Contrary to all other class Ib RNRs studied to-date, the sole RNR of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> displays class Ia-like activity regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Recently, we found that dATP inhibition in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RNR is enhanced by the presence of a nucleotide with no previously documented role in RNR regulation: an endogenous deoxyadenosine monophosphate (dAMP) that co-purifies with NrdE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. A co-crystal structure revealed dAMP bound to an unexpected site in the truncated N-terminal cone domain to promote α dimerization at a non-canonical interface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, <ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2210/pdb6CGL/pdb" ext-link-type="url">PDB: 6CGL</ext-link>) rather than the expected S-dimer interface. We denote this dAMP-binding site the “I-site” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>) for its potential role in inhibition and correspondingly denote this structure the “I-dimer”.

A 6 Å resolution cryo-EM map was obtained of holo-NrdE under inhibiting conditions (100 µM dATP, 1 mM CDP), revealing an unusual double-helix with a hollow center (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). In this structure, each helical strand is composed of alternating I-dimer and S-dimer interfaces, leading to a non-terminating chain of NrdE subunits (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Importantly, the simulated scattering from this double-helical model captures the distinct secondary scattering peak observed in the experimental scattering (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, black dashed), indicating that this structure is a stable species in solution.</p><p id="Par13">Because enzyme activity requires both α and β subunits, cryo-EM was repeated with mixtures of holo-NrdE and NrdF (abbreviated as “NrdEF”) under inhibiting conditions. The resultant cryo-EM map revealed a NrdEF filament consisting of a single-helical NrdE strand (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, gray surface) with EM density corresponding to NrdF observed at higher contour levels filling the helical interior (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, green). The resolution of the reconstruction varied across the map, as high-resolution features were distinguishable in NrdE but not in NrdF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5b, d</xref>). Additional density was observed in a hydrophobic cleft of NrdE (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>, green) that was previously shown to bind the β C-terminus in other class I RNRs. Using a previous structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> as a guide, we were able to model the bound NrdF C-terminus as an eight-residue polyalanine chain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>, see the section “Methods”). In the NrdE-only filament, this cleft is unoccupied and partially buried by the double-helical interface formed by residues 660–665 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>). Thus, the dissociation of the double-helical NrdE filament is likely a result of the NrdF C-terminus competing with this interface. These observations are consistent with a subunit titration performed with SAXS, in which addition of NrdF to the NrdE filament led to the immediate disappearance of the secondary peak (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, red star; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4d</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">For both filaments, excess density at the S-site was modeled as dATP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). As dATP acts as a specificity effector for CDP reduction, its presence at this site explains the formation of the S-dimer interface between adjacent I-dimer units. Additionally, a distinct, protruding density is observed at the I-site that is best explained as a dATP that displaced dAMP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). Side-chain densities in the I-dimer interface (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6c</xref>) are modeled well by a previously reported crystal structure of the dAMP-bound I-dimer (<ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2210/pdb6CGL/pdb" ext-link-type="url">PDB: 6CGL</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. A key feature of this interface is the “F47-loop” comprising residues 45–50, which immediately follows the partial ATP-cone sequence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). The F47-loops from adjacent monomers interlock at the I-dimer interface, with F47 and H49 reaching across to interact with the opposing chain (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6c</xref>). Our structures indicate that unlike dAMP, dATP can bind both allosteric sites, which further implies that any combination of a deoxyadenosine nucleotide at the I-site and a specificity effector at the S-site would induce dimerization at both interfaces and subsequent filament formation.</p><p id="Par15">Density for the NrdF core is significantly weaker than the remainder of the NrdEF map (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5b, d</xref>), but density for the NrdF C-terminus is observed at similar thresholds as NrdE (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). This discrepancy suggests that the NrdF core is flexibly linked to NrdE by NrdF C-termini, resulting in high occupancy but significant variability in orientation. The NrdF core volume is of the appropriate size and shape to be best explained by a NrdF dimer symmetrically centered with respect to a NrdE S-dimer, resulting in an α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> asymmetric unit (ASU) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, right). Attempts to refine the map from biased initial models with little gap between NrdE and NrdF invariably converged to have a pronounced gap of roughly 15–20  Å between the subunits (see the section “Methods”). Thus, instead of forming a buried interface with NrdE, the NrdF core density is on average placed far from the catalytic sites. Such a gap at the subunit interface would increase the distance between the buried site of radical generation in NrdF (Y105) and the first RT residue in NrdE (Y684) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, right), making it longer than the ~33 Å distance estimated for a class I RNR undergoing RT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). However, in the absence of well-resolved density for the NrdF core, we cannot simply attribute the mechanism of inhibition to NrdF adopting a single conformation in which RT is prevented. Rather, we place significance on the way in which NrdF is confined within the helical interior (i.e. along the filament axis) of the NrdE filament. Density for the NrdF core suggests that they are closely packed relatively to each other (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6b</xref>). Such confinement can still result in conformational disorder of the individual NrdF cores while hindering access to the full range of motions needed for NrdF to act as a catalytic partner for NrdE. In particular, limited motion of NrdF can inhibit RNR activity if sequential steps of enzymatic turnover require the sampling of multiple binding modes between subunits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Activation by ATP entails the dissociation of the I-dimer</title><p id="Par16">To investigate the structural basis for activation by ATP, we used SAXS to examine the effect of ATP on the dAMP-induced I-dimer.

Although no interactions are observed with the β-phosphate, significant new interactions are observed involving the ribose. Specifically, R117 is within H-bonding distance of the 2′-OH of the ribose, N3 of the adenine ring, and E119 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, green residues; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8b</xref>).

Interactions specific to deoxyribonucleotides appear to be made only when the I-dimer interface is formed, while those specific to ribonucleotides disfavor interactions with the F47-loop of a second chain. Such a mechanism also explains our SAXS results, which indicate that NrdE is a monomer in the absence of nucleotides at the I-site (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>).

We thus propose that GDP can bind this site and may in fact be the preferred ligand. In support of this, we screened 27 diffraction-quality crystals grown with various combinations of ATP, TTP, GDP, and CDP, and only those grown with GDP displayed electron density at the M-site. For example, no density was observed at this site in a 2.95 Å structure of the S-dimer obtained with CDP instead of GDP in the crystallization condition (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9c, d</xref>). The non-hydrolyzed nature of the ATP bound to this site further suggests that it was introduced when the crystal was soaked in freshly made cryoprotectant solution containing 5 mM ATP and that it may have displaced a GDP that primed this site for nucleotide-binding. Regardless, an important consequence of either ATP or GDP bound to the F47-loop is that the F47 side-chain flips inward by ~90° to form a π-stacking interaction with the purine ring (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). With F47 in this conformation, it is unable to participate in the formation of an I-dimer interface.

Unexpectedly, we were able to trap the final six residues of the NrdE C-terminus in the catalytic site of our 2.50 Å structure due to partial disulfide formation between the tail cysteines (C695, C698) and two catalytic-site cysteines (C382, C170) (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). These linkages, particularly that involving C695 and the initial site of the catalytically essential thiyl radical, C382, are likely artifacts of sample oxidation. However, they allowed us to capture the flexible C-terminus, which has never before been visualized in any class I RNR.

With the exception of the terminal residue V700, for which the side-chain does not participate in any polar interactions, all of the residues involved in binding the disulfide-trapped C-terminus are highly conserved in NrdE sequences (see the section “Methods”) and nearly superimposable with corresponding residues in previous structures of NrdE with no C-terminus bound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">Re-reduction of the catalytic-site cysteines is expected to require two sequential S<sub>N</sub>2 nucleophilic substitutions.

These three cysteines form a triad with optimal geometry for disulfide exchange, with C698 well positioned to attack C170. Thus, the tail-binding interactions involving C698, C170, and C409 appear to be physiologically relevant for the first step of re-reduction, in turn likely resulting in the oxidized C698–C170 we observe in our disulfide-trapped structure. In contrast, C695 is too far from C698 to perform the second step of re-reduction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10d</xref>) and is instead positioned closer to C382. A possible explanation is apparent in our X-ray-reduced structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>), in which we resolve an additional interaction: an H-bond between the residue adjacent to C695 (S694) and a non-conserved residue near the catalytic site (S246). Under physiological conditions, we expect C695 to move closer to C698, pulling the remainder of the C-terminus further into the catalytic site.</p><p id="Par26">Our structures also provide insight into the relationship between re-reduction and RT. In the current model for thiyl radical generation in class I RNRs, two tyrosines stack over C382 to form a π–π dyad required for co-linear proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

The Y684 side-chain flips out by ~180° to accommodate the resulting bend. These observations suggest that binding of the NrdE C-terminus is associated with the Y–Y dyad becoming unstacked, and hence, re-reduction of the catalytic site and RT cannot occur concurrently.

At physiologically relevant protein concentrations (low μM), nucleotide-free NrdE is primarily monomeric. The I-site is specific to adenine nucleotides where binding of deoxyribonucleotides (dAMP and dATP in particular) leads to a partially inactive I-dimer. In contrast, binding of any specificity effector (dATP, dGTP, or TTP) to the S-site stabilizes the S-dimer interface. Thus, the combination of these nucleotides leads to a NrdE filament having alternating dimer interfaces, with the inhibitor dATP uniquely able to bind both sites. Although NrdF is able to associate with the NrdE filament through its C-termini, when confined within the helical interior, we propose that it is unable to access the sequential motions necessary for interaction with NrdE as a catalytic partner. Conversely, the primary activating effect of ATP is to destabilize the I-dimer interface by displacing deoxyribonucleotides at the I-site. As ATP has a low affinity for the S-site, the combination of a specificity effector at the S-site and ATP at the I-site favors S-dimer formation. Likewise, ATP is able to dissociate the NrdEF filament at the I-dimer interfaces, producing α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> complexes as the active form. In this oligomerization state, NrdF is able to access the full range of motions needed for RNR activity.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A model for the overall allosteric regulation of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RNR. Without nucleotides, NrdE is a monomer, but dAMP and dATP can bind the I-site and induce a partially inhibited I-dimer. Addition of specificity effectors instead induces the monomer to form an S-dimer. When specificity effectors (including dATP) bind to the I-dimer, they induce formation of an inhibited double-helical NrdE filament composed of alternating S-dimer and I-dimer interfaces. NrdF competes for the NrdE double-helical interface, and thus NrdF binding leads to the dissociation of the NrdE double-helix into individual helical structures. NrdF binds to the helical interior of the NrdE filament, leading to an inter-subunit gap and positional confinement that prevent NrdF from accessing NrdE for turnover. Both the NrdE and NrdEF filaments are reversible by addition of ATP, which can displace dATP from the I-site and induce dissociation of the I-dimer interface.

In particular, the I-site, which is formed by residues in the α<sub>2</sub>-helix of the truncated ATP-cone and adjacent secondary structural elements, has evolved adenine specificity and sugar discrimination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). However, it shows no apparent discrimination for the number of phosphates, perhaps indicating that unlike the S-site, it has yet to evolve specificity for triphosphates, the final products of deoxyribonucleotide metabolism. Alternatively, the ability of the I-site (but not S-site) to tightly bind dAMP in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RNR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> may be advantageous as an additional tuning dial for activity regulation. Although not shown in our scheme (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), our results also suggest a secondary mechanism for activation involving the M-site. Because the M-site is coupled to the F47-loop, ATP and possibly GDP binding here would directly interfere with I-dimer formation. Notably, it has been shown by analytical ultracentrifugation that in the presence of GDP, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> NrdE is monomeric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, as apo-NrdE is preferentially a monomer, binding of nucleotide at the M-site does not appear to be a requirement of I-dimer dissociation.</p><p id="Par31">Our crystal structures provide key insight into the requirements of an active complex. The α C-terminal residues that we observe (695-CLSCVV-700) occupy the catalytic site in a conformation that is remarkably similar to the binding mode of nucleotide substrates observed in other class I RNRs, with the terminal carboxylate mirroring the interactions of a substrate β-phosphate (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10a, b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Since catalytic-site reduction by the α C-terminus is likely a derived trait of class I and II RNRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, this similarity suggests that the C-terminus evolved to mimic substrate binding. These structures also imply that when the α C-terminus is bound, RT cannot occur due to the coupled unstacking of the Y–Y dyad. Conversely, alignment of our structures with the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> suggests that when the Y–Y dyad is stacked, the associated β-sheet (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12b</xref>, yellow cartoon) presents a grooved surface that may serve as a potential binding site for the β C-terminus. Such a binding mode would bring Y307 on the flexible region of the β C-terminus in close proximity to the Y–Y dyad in an arrangement thought to be necessary for RT (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). Together, these structures imply that binding of the α and β C-termini to the catalytic site may be mutually exclusive and that significant structural dynamics are required for RNR activity.</p><p id="Par32">Consistent with this notion, our SAXS results provide evidence for an α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> conformation that is asymmetric like the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> NrdEF structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In this structure, one lobe of NrdF makes direct contact (570 Å<sup>2</sup> buried surface area) with two notable structural features of NrdE: the first helix of the truncated ATP-cone, as well as a β-hairpin loop with potential evolutionary significance (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>, inset). The involvement of the truncated ATP-cone suggests that it may have a role beyond I-dimer formation that is important for activity. Additionally, the β-hairpin loop, which has a known function in class II RNRs for binding the adenosylcobalamin radical cofactor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, perhaps serves a similar role of stabilizing the radical subunit in class I RNRs. The resulting asymmetric interactions of β<sub>2</sub> to α<sub>2</sub> may enable one side of the tetramer to engage in RT while the other catalytic site remains open for re-reduction.</p><p id="Par33">Although filaments of other enzymes in nucleotide metabolism have recently been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, the dATP-inhibited filament of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RNR is unusual for its ability to modulate catalytic activity by reversible assembly. To date, no other RNR lacking an ATP-cone has been reported to display such behavior.

Because the class Ib enzyme of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is the sole RNR used by the organism, evolution of new binding sites and allosteric mechanisms within the truncated ATP-cone domain may have been advantageous.

Micrograph movie-frames were first aligned via full-frame registration. Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters of each micrograph were then determined by matching the theoretical CTF with the image Thon-rings in the 8–35 Å resolution range. All NrdE filaments were manually annotated using the “filament selection” tool in PARTICLE, which was used to mark both ends of a filament and then box out individual frames along the filament axis at 40 Å offset steps and at 256 × 256 pixels per frame. In total, 85,532 NrdE “particles” were boxed for 2D classification. The “direct particle classification” algorithm (DPC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> was then used in 2D particle classification.</p><p id="Par43">PARTICLE organizes consecutive frames boxed from the same segment into one group to track the sequential connectivity among adjacent class averages and then pieces together a composite helical filament with enhanced image contrast and signal-to-noise ratio for initial 3D reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>). Computationally, two neighboring class-average frames are composed together by aligning the overlapping regions of interest (ROIs) via local cross-correlation maximization using both translational and rotational searches. A small in-plane rotational degree-of-freedom was included in the NrdE filament refinement to counter potential local bending of the filament but was limited to &lt;10° variation because the filaments are relatively rigid. Once aligned, the pixel intensity in the region of overlap is set to the average of the ROIs from both segments. This process is repeatedly applied to include all related class-averages to form the final composite filament. We found that the length of a repeating pattern measured in the composite filament is approximately 675 Å (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>, orange dashed line). Because the long dimension of a NrdE I-dimer is ~75 Å, according to the previously determined crystal structure (<ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2210/pdb6CGL/pdb" ext-link-type="url">PDB: 6CGL</ext-link>), we predicted that this repeating pattern would contain nine dimeric units over a span of 675 Å. We thus estimated the unit rotation angle to be around <italic>N</italic> × 360°/9 = <italic>N</italic> × 40°, where <italic>N</italic> = 1, 2, 3… is the number of helical turns.

Taking the above initial model as reference, a projection-matching algorithm was used to align all DPC class averages and also used in the subsequent 3D reconstruction and refinement. According to the DPC algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, each “seed” raw image receives its initial alignment from the corresponding class average for the subsequent processing. A phase-residual-based projection-matching algorithm was used in the particle alignment. In each refinement cycle, the alignment parameters (<italic>X</italic>/<italic>Y</italic>-translation and three Euler angles) of each particle frame were adjusted to maximize the phase agreement with the current reference model projection up to the resolution cut-off at a Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143. In the 3D reconstruction, each particle frame was weighted by its phase-residual score in Fourier-space insertion. After 50 iterations, the 3D reconstruction converged to ~5.8 Å resolution (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3c</xref>). To further improve the resolution of the helical reconstruction, the helical parameters were re-evaluated at the end of each iteration of refinement using the “helical symmetry solver” function in PARTICLE, in which a local search (within 2 Å and 2°) around the current helical parameters was performed to identify the maximum density cross-correlation within a cylindrical mask over two repeating units (150 Å) in the middle of the double-helix density map (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3d</xref>). The resulting helical parameters were applied to symmetrize the reconstructed density map in the current iteration, which then served as the reference for the next iteration of refinement. Through 50 iterations of masked local refinement, the 3D reconstruction converged to 4.8 Å resolution as determined by the standard 0.143 FSC criterion. However, based on features of our map as well as our map-model FSC, we believe the NrdE map to actually be closer to 6 Å and thus report it as such. The double-helix NrdE filament has two sets of helical symmetry parameters: the inter-helix symmetry (74.24 Å, −81.28°, where the negative sign indicates a flip in handedness) and intra-helix symmetry (37.12 Å, 139.36°).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Electron microscopy of the NrdEF filament</title><p id="Par45">Cryo-EM samples of the NrdEF filament were prepared by mixing 20 μM holo-NrdE with 20 or 40 μM Mn-reconstituted NrdF in assay buffer with 100 µM dATP and 1 mM CDP, prior to four-fold dilution with nucleotide-containing buffer. 3.5 μL of the diluted sample (5 µM NrdE and 5 or 10 µM NrdF) was applied to glow-discharged 200 mesh C-flat grids (Protochips, 2 μm hole size), blotted with Whatman #1 filter paper (GE Healthcare), and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using an EM-GP (Leica) held at 95% relative humidity.

It is possible that data sorting was superfluous because manual boxing of helices pre-selects for high-quality particles.

Helical symmetry emerged naturally in the C<sub>1</sub>-refined map.

Initial refinement against the apo-NrdE monomer yielded significant unmodeled electron density at the S-, I-, and catalytic sites. Following several cycles of manual model building in Coot and refinement in Phenix, TTP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> was modeled into both S-sites in the ASU, ADP was modeled into the I-site density of both chains, and the C-terminal peptide was modeled into the catalytic sites of both chains. No omit or Polder omit density for a ligand was observed at the M-sites. The final model for the 2.95 Å NrdE S-dimer includes residues 8–269, 275–603, 610–685, and 694–700 in chain A; 7–237, 246–685, and 694–700 in chain B; two molecules of TTP; two molecules of ADP; and two Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p id="Par55">To produce the crystal structures of disulfide-trapped (<ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2210/pdb6MT9/pdb" ext-link-type="url">PDB: 6MT9</ext-link>) and X-ray-reduced (<ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2210/pdb6MVE/pdb" ext-link-type="url">PDB: 6MVE</ext-link>) NrdE S-dimer, a highly redundant dataset was collected on a single crystal grown from the TTP/ATP/GDP condition to yield two structures: a 2.50 Å disulfide-trapped structure and a 2.55 Å X-ray-reduced structure from the second half of data collection (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). The 2.50 Å structure was refined in a similar manner as above. Clear electron density was observed at the M-site, S-site, I-site, and catalytic site. TTP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> was modeled into the S-site. As in the 2.95 Å structure, the electron density at the I-site was more consistent with ADP than with ATP. At the M-site, both ATP and GDP were initially considered. While the electron density is less resolved here than at the I- or S-sites, there is a notable lack of density for the N2 amine of a GDP, and there is also density for a γ-phosphate. Thus, ATP was modeled into the density rather than GDP. We note, however, that the binding site is likely to be able to bind GDP as well, and that the ATP may have displaced GDP when soaked in with cryoprotectant.</p><p id="Par56">Density at the catalytic site was modeled as a peptide based on its shape and connectivity to catalytic-site residues C382 and C170. The C-terminus was then built via iterative manual residue placement in Coot and refinement in Phenix, using the disulfide bridges involving C695 and C698 as anchor points. Interestingly, these disulfides were not reduced by fresh TCEP that was introduced in the cryoprotectant. However, we were able to obtain a largely reduced structure by collecting a redundant diffraction dataset. Using these later frames, the structure was solved via rigid body refinement using the 2.50 Å oxidized structure as a starting model. The resulting 2.55 Å dataset (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>) is at slightly lower resolution while retaining good merging statistics. The structure is virtually unchanged except that cysteines 382, 170, 695, and 698 were better modeled in the reduced form. However, we note that there is evidence for mixed disulfide occupancy in both the 2.50 and 2.55 Å structures (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). The final models for the 2.50 Å disulfide-trapped and 2.55 Å X-ray reduced NrdE structures include residues 6–238, 246–685, and 695–700 (2.50 Å) or 694–700 (2.55 Å); 1 molecule of TTP; 1 molecule of ADP; 1 molecule of ATP; 1 Mg<sup>2+</sup>; and 194 (2.50 Å) or 133 (2.55 Å) water molecules.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par57">Further information on research design is available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Albert Kim and Dr. Mackenzie Parker for providing the NrdF samples used in this study.
