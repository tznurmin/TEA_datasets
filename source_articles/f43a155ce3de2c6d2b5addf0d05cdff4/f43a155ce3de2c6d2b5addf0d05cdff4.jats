Lung neutrophilia is a hallmark of RSV disease but the mechanism by which neutrophils are recruited and activated is unclear. Here, we investigate the innate immune signaling pathways underlying neutrophil recruitment and activation in RSV-infected mice. We show that MyD88/TRIF signaling is essential for lung neutrophil recruitment while MAVS signaling, leading to type I IFN production, is necessary for neutrophil activation. Consistent with that notion, administration of type I IFNs to the lungs of RSV-infected <italic>Mavs</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice partially activates lung neutrophils recruited via the MyD88/TRIF pathway. Conversely, lack of neutrophil recruitment to the lungs of RSV-infected <italic>Myd88/Trif</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice can be corrected by administration of chemoattractants and those neutrophils become fully activated. Interestingly, <italic>Myd88/Trif</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice did not have increased lung viral loads during RSV infection, suggesting that neutrophils are dispensable for viral control. Thus, two distinct pathogen sensing pathways collaborate for neutrophil recruitment and full activation during RSV infection.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Society for Mucosal Immunology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41385_2019_Article_190.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedicine, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Immunology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Allergology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Antibodies</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Gastroenterology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Neutrophils are classically considered as among the first immune cells to respond to both infection and injury.

We also confirmed that live virus, and not any mediator in the virus preparation, was necessary for neutrophil recruitment and activation as ultra-violet inactivated RSV (UV RSV) did not recruit neutrophils, induce MMP-9, MPO or NE secretion, or drive CD64 cell surface upregulation on lung neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).

However, these mice did not display significantly more MMP-9 and NE levels in BAL than mock-treated <italic>Mavs</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. It is possible that this may be a quantitative defect due to the fact that a single administration of IFN-α at 6 h p.i. may not sufficiently replicate the kinetics of IFN-α production in wt mice. Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that factors in addition to IFN-α are required to drive full neutrophil activation. Therefore, our data suggest that <italic>Mavs</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> deficient neutrophils become at least partially activated when they are in an inflammatory environment induced downstream of IFN-α. This likely involves ISG protein products upregulated downstream of type I IFN receptor signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> It is interesting to consider that while type I IFNs have a beneficial inhibitory effect on viral load they also drive lung inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and, as we show in this work, neutrophil activation during RSV infection. Therefore, the potential use of type I IFNs as a therapeutic in RSV infection must be carefully considered to avoid immunopathology.</p><p id="Par21">As RSV infected <italic>Myd88/Trif</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice have intact MAVS signaling, we hypothesized that RSV infection would induce the upregulation of the factor/s which are required for neutrophil activation. Indeed, the very few lung neutrophils found in <italic>Myd88/Trif</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice upregulated CD64. We suspect that the reason MMP-9, MPO and NE were not detected in the airways of these mice was because there were too few neutrophils to release detectable quantities of these mediators. Consistent with that possibility, when neutrophils were artificially recruited into the lungs of RSV-infected <italic>Myd88/Trif</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice by administration of rCXCL1, the lung neutrophils upregulated CD64 and MMP-9, MPO and NE were detected in the airways. It is known that CXCL1 has a role in both the recruitment and activation of neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and treatment with rCXCL1 on its own did induce some production of MMP-9, MPO and NE in the lungs of <italic>Myd88/Trif</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. However, rCXCL1 treatment in the absence of RSV did not induce the upregulation of CD64 on lung neutrophils. Furthermore, neutrophil mediator production was amplified and CD64 upregulated on neutrophils by RSV infection during rCXCL1 treatment of <italic>Myd88/Trif</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, demonstrating that the inflammatory environment induced by RSV infection was required for full neutrophil activation. These data support our finding that an intact MAVS signaling pathway is sufficient to induce an inflammatory environment that at least partially activates neutrophils during RSV infection.</p><p id="Par22">To summarize, this paper demonstrates for the first time that two distinct innate immune signaling pathways collaborate to ensure that both neutrophil recruitment and activation occur during RSV infection. MyD88/TRIF signaling is necessary to attract and recruit neutrophils and MAVS signaling is crucial to create an inflammatory environment in the lung that drives at least partial neutrophil activation. Excessive neutrophilia can be detrimental to the health of lung tissue and compromise efficient gas exchange. As such, a deeper understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate neutrophil recruitment and activation may help pave the way towards development of potential therapies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par23">Wt C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River. <italic>Ifna6gfp</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Ifna6gfp</italic><sup>+/−</sup><italic>Myd88Trif</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Ifna6gfp</italic><sup>+/−</sup><italic>Mavs</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice were bred in-house (obtained from S.
