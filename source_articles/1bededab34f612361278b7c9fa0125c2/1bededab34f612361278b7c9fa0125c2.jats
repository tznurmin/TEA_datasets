Here, we show that NLK inhibits the antiviral immune response during viral infection by targeting MAVS for degradation. NLK depletion promotes virus-induced antiviral cytokine production and decreases viral replication, which is potently rescued by the reintroduction of NLK. Moreover, the depletion of NLK promotes antiviral effects and increases the survival times of mice after infection with VSV. NLK interacts with and phosphorylates MAVS at multiple sites on mitochondria or peroxisomes, thereby inducing the degradation of MAVS and subsequent inactivation of IRF3. Most importantly, a peptide derived from MAVS promotes viral-induced IFN-Î² production and antagonizes viral replication in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide direct insights into the molecular mechanisms by which phosphorylation of MAVS regulates its degradation and influences its activation and identify an important peptide target for propagating antiviral responses.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">The Nemo-like kinase (NLK) plays a regulatory role in immune responses.

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns are detected by several classes of pattern recognition receptors that initiate innate immune responses, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors, Nod-like receptors (NLRs), and cytoplasmic DNA sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. After pathogen recognition, pattern recognition receptors trigger the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB transcription factor, production of type I interferons (IFNs), and induction of subsequent adaptive immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. RIG-I, MDA5, and TLR3 play important roles in RNA virus recognition and subsequent TRAF3 activation. In endosomes, TLR3 recognizes viral double-stranded RNA and triggers a signaling pathway mediated by the adapters TRIF and TRAF3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In the cytoplasm, the RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA5 function as cytoplasmic RNA sensors that can recognize both the Sendai virus (SeV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) RNA viruses, resulting in recruitment of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS; VISA, IPS-1, or Cardif) and TRAF3-dependent assembly of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which further activates the downstream signaling molecules TBK1 and IRF3, to achieve the type I interferon response after ligand recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, dA:dT-rich dsDNA is reportedly transcribed into dsRNA by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III (Pol III), which in turn stimulates RIG-I and its downstream signaling cascade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Mitochondria provide most of the energy for cells and are therefore referred to as the powerhouse of the cell. MAVS was first identified by four independent groups in 2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The mitochondrial location of MAVS is critical for the antiviral response; thus, depending on the mitochondrial location and virus stimulation, MAVS forms prion-like aggregates and recruits upstream and downstream proteins into the mitochondria as the MAVS regulome to transmit the antiviral signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, mitochondria are considered a platform and hub for antiviral innate immune signaling. Posttranslational modification (PTM) is an important regulatory mechanism for signaling, and the ubiquitination of MAVS has been extensively studied. RNF5 has been reported to shut down antiviral responses through the ubiquitination and degradation of MAVS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Another E3 ligase, AIP4, mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination through PCBP2, leading to the degradation of MAVS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation is a critical signaling process for cell biological behavior. Although three kinases, PLK1 and c-Abl and PKACs, were found to be associated with MAVS and to orchestrate virus-induced MAVS signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, whether MAVS is the real substrate of these three kinases in response to viral stimulation remains elusive. Furthermore, the association between the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of MAVS urgently requires determination.</p><p id="Par5">As uncontrolled immune responses can cause extensive damage to the host, NF-ÎºB activation and type I interferon signaling must be tightly regulated to maintain host immune homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Despite the importance of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-mediated type I interferon signaling to the immune response, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of RLR-mediated signaling via the posttranscriptional modification of MAVS remain poorly understood.</p><p id="Par6">Nemo-like kinase (NLK), the vertebrate homolog of the <italic>nemo</italic> gene, was discovered in mice by Brott et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. NLK can directly phosphorylate transcription factors or signaling pathway intermediates, exerting either positive or negative effects depending on the NLK target. The serine/threonine protein kinase activity of NLK was initially reported to negatively regulate the Wnt signaling pathway by phosphorylating TCF/LEF factors and inhibiting interactions between the Î²-catenin-TCF complex and DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Subsequently, a number of transcriptional regulators were identified as substrates of NLK. For example, NLK phosphorylates c-Myb, resulting in its degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. NLK-mediated Foxo1 phosphorylation has been shown to inhibit Foxo1-mediated transcription by promoting its nuclear export<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. STAT3 phosphorylation induced by the TAK1-NLK cascade is indispensable for TGF-Î²-mediated mesoderm induction during early <italic>Xenopus</italic> development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. NLK also regulates Wnt-5a signaling by phosphorylating SETDB1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Recent studies have shown that NLK acts as a negative regulator of Notch signaling by phosphorylating Notch1-ICD and interfering with the formation of active Notch transcriptional complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In addition, NLK is involved in nervous system development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and cancer cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Our group has shown that NLK regulates NF-kappa B signaling by disrupting the interaction of TAK1 with IKK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. These findings imply potential roles of NLK in regulating immune responses.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we sought to characterize the function of NLK in the innate immune response, and we report the potent negative regulation of type I interferon signaling by NLK. NLK strongly hinders type I interferon production by phosphorylating MAVS, thereby resulting in its degradation and subsequent inactivation of downstream signaling pathways. A new peptide derived from MAVS was characterized against viruses, revealing obvious antiviral effects both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that NLK is vital for the cellular homeostatic control of innate immunity and identify a new peptide targeting the NLK/MAVS complex for the propagation of antiviral responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>NLK is a negative regulator of virus-induced signaling</title><p id="Par8">To characterize the kinase that potentially regulates virus-induced signaling, we screened ~100 kinases using an IFN-Î² luciferase reporter after SeV stimulation. NLK significantly inhibited SeV-induced IFN-Î² luciferase activity (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a, b</xref>). Although NLK is not the only kinase that may orchestrate SeV-induced IFN-Î² luciferase activation, further confirmation indicated that NLK showed the strongest inhibitory effect. To further verify the function of NLK in this pathway, we cotransfected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T cells) with an IFN-Î² luciferase reporter plasmid and increasing concentrations of the NLK expression plasmid and then treated the cells with SeV to trigger type I interferon signaling. NLK potently inhibited SeV-induced IFN-Î² luciferase reporter activation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas IFN-Î³-induced activation of the IRF1 promoter had no effect during NLK overexpression (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Because IFN-Î² activation requires coordination between the activation of NF-ÎºB and IRF3, we used an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) luciferase reporter that required only IRF3 activation to evaluate whether the NLK-dependent inhibition of type I interferon was dependent on its inhibitory effect on ISRE signaling. SeV-induced ISRE luciferase reporter activity was potently inhibited by NLK, suggesting that NLK inhibited IFN-Î² activation by blocking IRF3 signaling (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).

We also detected the NLK protein levels in various cell lines to assess whether they were higher in immune system cells than in other cell lines. We chose to perform immunoblot experiments with TPH-1 human monocytes, RKO colon carcinoma cells, N87 gastric carcinoma cells, MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells, HeLa cervix adenocarcinoma cells, HepG2 liver carcinoma cells, and A549 lung carcinoma cells. Notably, NLK protein expression was not highest in TPH-1 human immune cells (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1e</xref>). These two experiments suggested that the location and activity of NLK might change in response to SeV, but these changes are not attributable to alterations at the mRNA or protein level. NLK reportedly localizes to the Golgi apparatus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, but whether it also localizes to mitochondria and peroxisomes, which are antiviral platforms under infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, has not been examined in previous studies. To understand whether the localization of NLK changes in response to SeV stimulation, cell fractionation and immunofluorescence (IF) experiments were performed. NLK was present in both mitochondrial and peroxisomal fractions in unstimulated cells. Interestingly, infection of cells with SeV resulted in the redistribution of NLK into mitochondrial and peroxisomal fractions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1eâg</xref>).

To determine whether NLK deficiency potentiates IRF3 activation, we examined IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization in NLK<sup>â/â</sup> and wild-type cells.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) of the IFN-Î² and RANTES protein levels yielded similar results (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Antiviral response analyses using flow cytometry and plaque assays consistently demonstrated that NLK reconstitution in NLK<sup>â/â</sup> HCT116 cells significantly restored the frequency and viral titer of infected GFP-positive cells after VSV-GFP infection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>).

We cotransfected HEK293T cells with the RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1, or IRF3 expression vector together with an NLK expression vector containing an IFN-Î² or ISRE luciferase reporter, and NLK potently inhibited luciferase reporter activation in the presence of RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1 but weakly inhibited IRF3 activity (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2a, b</xref>). We previously demonstrated that NLK impacts IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization, suggesting that NLK may inhibit type I interferon signaling by acting upstream of IRF3. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses confirmed that NLK interacted with MAVS but not with TBK1 and RIG-I, suggesting that NLK exerts its action on MAVS upstream of IRF3 to orchestrate the antiviral response (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that NLK was weakly associated with MAVS in unstimulated cells, and this association was clearly strengthened at 16âh after SeV stimulation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). To further confirm the association between NLK and MAVS, we performed IF analysis to check their colocalization. Although most endogenous NLK was located in the nucleus, NLK in the cytosol colocalized very well with MAVS, and this colocalization was especially enhanced in MAVS prion-like aggregates after virus infection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). MAVS is located on both mitochondria and peroxisomes. To explore the location of interaction between NLK and MAVS, we constructed mitochondria- and peroxisome-localized MAVS mutants, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that NLK interacted with both mitochondria- and peroxisome-localized MAVS mutants but not with the cytosol-localized MAVS mutants (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Virus infection can reportedly promote the oligomerization of MAVS into a large prion-like signaling structure. To determine whether NLK is present in the prion-like MAVS complex after viral infection, we employed semidenaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, NLK exhibited a band similar to that of MAVS following viral infection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>), which implies that NLK is present in the prion-like complex together with MAVS after viral infection.

To understand how NLK inhibits the antiviral response, we sought to examine whether NLK decreases the stability of the MAVS/TRAF3 complex. To achieve this goal, we cotransfected NLK, MAVS and TRAF3 into HEK293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation did not reveal a significant ability of NLK to hinder the binding of MAVS and TRAF3, but we did observe degradation of MAVS after overexpressing NLK (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that NLK might phosphorylate and influence the stability of MAVS, leading to the degradation of MAVS. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed MAVS and NLK in a dose-dependent manner. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, NLK decreased the protein level of MAVS, and this effect was dependent on the amount of NLK. To assess whether the kinase activity of NLK was required for the degradation of MAVS, we overexpressed MAVS together with NLK or NLK<sup>KM</sup> and found that the kinase activity of NLK appeared to be responsible for the degradation of MAVS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).

To further assess the influence of NLK on the stability of MAVS, we used a cycloheximide-chase (CHX) assay based on the time course of MAVS degradation. An increase in the half-life of MAVS in NLK-depleted BMDMs and HCT116 cells supported the hypothesis that NLK stabilizes the protein expression of MAVS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). Stimulation of the virus-induced degradation of MAVS using SeV induced the degradation of MAVS in NLK-depleted BMDMs, which suggested that NLK regulated the SeV-induced degradation of MAVS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).

Given that NLK is a serine/threonine protein kinase, we believe that MAVS undergoes phosphorylation. To verify this hypothesis, we carried out a <sup>32</sup>P labeling kinase assay in vitro. We failed to express GST-NLK and MAVS in bacteria; instead, Flag-NLK, Flag-NLK<sup>KM</sup>, and HA-MAVS were purified from the HEK293T cells using a high salt concentration to wash out protein impurities. These data indicated that NLK, but not the NLK<sup>KM</sup> mutant, directly phosphorylated MAVS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). This result was further supported using a phospho-(Ser/Thr) antibody (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>), which also suggested that the shift in MAVS required the kinase activity of NLK. To further confirm that this PTM-induced shift was caused by phosphorylation, we sought to determine whether Î»-PPase could prohibit this modification. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>, Î»-PPase inhibited the MAVS shift in the presence of NLK. Next, we investigated the residues of MAVS that were phosphorylated by NLK. Masspec was employed to analyze the PTM of MAVS in the presence or absence of NLK or NLK<sup>KM</sup>. According to the obtained data, MAVS is subject to housekeeper phosphorylation events at serines 152/165/222 in the presence of NLK as well as at 4 other sites, serines 121/212/258/329 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). To identify the most important site for MAVS function, we constructed a MAVS mutant by changing these 4 serines to alanines, either individually (MAVS<sup>S121A</sup>, MAVS<sup>S212A</sup>, MAVS<sup>S258A</sup>, and MAVS<sup>S329A</sup>) or all together (MAVS<sup>S4A</sup>). MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> possessed the strongest ability to induce <italic>IFNÎ²</italic> production in the presence of NLK (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>); therefore, we used this mutant to study antiviral function. To determine whether the phosphorylation of the 4 residues plays a role in antiviral activity, we used the MAVS mutant MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> to perform plaque assays. MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> promoted antiviral effects in the presence of NLK and in MAVS<sup>â/â</sup> HEK293T cells compared with that in wild-type MAVS HEK293T cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). We explored whether MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> could block the shift induced by NLK, revealing that MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> completely abrogated this shift when MAVS and MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> were expressed in the presence of NLK (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). Next, we asked whether MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> could also alter the stability of MAVS in MAVS<sup>â/â</sup> HEK293T cells. To address this question, the CHX assay was performed, which showed that MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> displayed a longer half-life than wild-type MAVS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). To determine whether the SeV-induced degradation of MAVS is affected by MAVS<sup>S4A</sup>, we expressed MAVS and MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> in MAVS<sup>â/â</sup> cells and stimulated them with SeV to induce MAVS degradation. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>, MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> blocked SeV-induced degradation, which indicated that SeV-induced MAVS degradation requires the phosphorylation of MAVS at the 4 serine residues.

The transmembrane domain (TM) was shown to be required for the mitochondria or peroxisome localization of MAVS, and loss of this region resulted in the disaggregation of MAVS and NLK (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>), which indicated that the interaction occurred on mitochondria or peroxisome. Further mapping of the aa451-aa500 region of MAVS required for NLK binding revealed that the aa471-aa480 peptide (denoted by NLK-associated and MAVS-derived antiviral peptide (NAMDAP) herein) was necessary for the interaction between MAVS and NLK (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). First, we assessed the competitive role of NAMDAP for binding between MAVS and NLK, revealing that NAMDAP effectively reduced the association between MAVS and NLK (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). Thus, we also determined whether NAMDAP protects MAVS from degradation induced by the interaction between NLK and MAVS. Upon the addition of NAMDAP at different doses, the MAVS shift was ameliorated in the presence of 10âÂµg/ml NAMDAP, and MAVS became more abundant with increasing amounts of NAMDAP (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4c</xref>). Then, we assessed whether NAMDAP could rescue the inhibitory effect of NLK on MAVS-induced IFN production and the antiviral response. By analyzing the mRNA levels of IFN and viral replication, NAMDAP was found to reverse the effect of NLK on MAVS (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4d, e</xref>). Moreover, we performed a similar experiment to confirm whether NAMDAP could influence the effect of NLK on endogenous MAVS.

Next, we examined whether NAMDAP could potentiate the antiviral response after viral infection. To achieve this goal, we assessed the antiviral response following the addition of NAMDAP after VSV-GFP infection using flow cytometry and plaque assays (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e, f</xref>). As shown in the figures, NAMDAP promoted the VSV-GFP-induced antiviral response. Additionally, NAMDAP increased the mRNA expression levels of the antiviral cytokines <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> and <italic>RANTES</italic> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8g</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4f</xref>). To further verify the antiviral effects of NAMDAP in vivo, mice were infected with VSV-GFP and NAMDAP via tail vein injection.

In this study, we identified a role of NLK in the negative regulation of type I interferon signaling and demonstrated the molecular mechanisms by which NLK regulates MAVS phosphorylation and degradation and influences its signaling through phosphorylation at multiple serine sites. We also identified an antiviral peptide, NAMDAP, that displayed obvious antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="Par17">As a type of PTM, phosphorylation plays a vital role in signaling, including that in the innate immune system. However, it is not clear whether phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of MAVS. Therefore, we screened more than 100 kinases to identify potential genes that play important roles in the innate immune system. Fortunately, one evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, NLK, was found to exert strong inhibitory effects on the production of antiviral cytokines after the infection of cells with SeV. We further identified this antiviral effect through gene overexpression or knock out. Moreover, a mouse experiment revealed a strong role of NLK in the antiviral response. We explored the mechanism by which NLK influences antiviral innate immunity. MAVS was identified as a substrate of NLK, and phosphorylation of MAVS by NLK resulted in its degradation. The MAVS<sup>S4A</sup> mutant was shown to be more stable than wild-type MAVS under resting conditions and SeV-induced degradation, suggesting that the phosphorylation of MAVS by NLK switches the subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of MAVS. The effective antiviral response to the peptide revealed that domain mapping is an effective and practicable method for elucidating how to ameliorate innate immunity inhibition and thus enhance the antiviral response. The schematic diagram of NLK for innate immunity inhibition as shown in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>.</p><p id="Par18">In response to SeV stimulation, the NLK mRNA and protein levels differed slightly at various time points, indicating that NLK kinase activity or localization might change after viral stimulation. Although endogenous NLK localizes to the Golgi apparatus in the absence of stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, the isolation of cell fractions showed that NLK translocated into mitochondria or peroxisomes, where MAVS exerts its effect after viral stimulation. This observation suggested a potential association between NLK and MAVS in the antiviral response. Immunoprecipitation showed that NLK has a weak association with MAVS in resting cells. In contrast, NLK bound strongly to MAVS after exposure to the virus in the later phase of infection. This interaction was shown to occur in both mitochondria and peroxisomes as well as to require the transmembrane domain of MAVS, further revealing the significance of mitochondria or peroxisomes as a platform in the antiviral response and showing that this interaction is necessary for the phosphorylation of MAVS by NLK. More interestingly, NLK was present in a complex with oligomeric MAVS, supporting that NLK plays an important role in antiviral response homeostasis.</p><p id="Par19">The region of MAVS that interacts with NLK overlays its region that interacts with TRAF3, but the interaction between TRAF3 and MAVS is not affected by NLK. In fact, in addition to its association with MAVS, TRAF3 was also found to bind to NLK, but we did not observe an obvious change in TRAF3 protein expression, and NLK did not exert its antiviral effect through TRAF3.</p><p id="Par20">We have previously shown that NLK plays an important role in TNFÎ±-induced NF-ÎºB signaling. We elucidated the contribution of NLK to the IRF3 and NF-ÎºB pathways, in which the kinase activity of NLK is required for IRF3 signaling but is not necessary for the NF-ÎºB pathway. NAMDAP plays a notable rescue role in antiviral response inhibition by NLK but a relatively weak role in promoting the virus-induced antiviral response, revealing another potent target of NLK in the innate immune response. Furthermore, NLK has been reported to suppress the expression of a wide range of genes through the CREB binding protein (CBP) coactivator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Thus, NLK potentially controls the innate immunity-related transcription factor complex to negatively regulate type I interferon signaling. Our future efforts will be directed at understanding the function of NLK in this pathway. The short life span of NAMDAP should be considered to increase its antiviral effect in vitro and in vivo.

Cells were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (10âmM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150âmM NaCl, 1âmM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% NP40) containing fresh protease inhibitor cocktail on ice for 30âmin and then frozen and thawed twice. The cells were then lysed by sonication. An equal amount of 1âÃâsample loading buffer (0.5âÃâTBE, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.0025% bromophenol blue) was added to the lysate, and the mixture was loaded onto a vertical 1.5% agarose gel (containing 10% SDS). After electrophoresis in running buffer (1âÃâTBE and 0.1% SDS) for 35âmin at a constant voltage of 100âV at 4âÂ°C, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane for immunoblotting. For native page, the cell was resuspended by Lysis Buffer (50âmM Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 150âmM NaCl, 1âmM PMSF, 1âmM EDTA, 1% NP40, 1âmM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate). It was vortexed for 15âs and then lysed on ice for about 60âmin. Afterwards, it was freeze and thawed for thrice. The lysate was then centrifuged for 30âmin at 15,000ârpm. Adding 5âÂµl 5âÃâSample Loading Buffer (0.3âM Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 0.0025% bromophenol blue) into the 20âÂµl lysate and the lysate was loaded onto a vertical polyacrylamide gel which was pre-electrophoresis for 30âmin with a constant current of 30âmA. After electrophoresis in the running buffer (Tris base: 15.12âg, Glucine: 72.06âg, pH 8.47 for 500âmL 1âÃâNative Running Buffer) for 35âmin with a constant current of 5âmA and 2âh with a constant current of 10âmA, the proteins were transferred to an PVDF membrane for immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>RNA isolation and real-time PCR</title><p id="Par29">Cells were lysed with TRIzol (TAKARA, Otsu, Japan), and RNA was isolated according to standard protocols.
