It is expressed predominantly in the mammalian small intestine (with highest expression in the duodenum), and also expressed in rodent liver at lower levels. Sensing lipid absorption in enterocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], ApoA-IV is synthesized and packaged with lipids and other apolipoproteins into chylomicrons and secreted through the lymphatic system into the blood. Once there, as a member of exchangeable apolipoproteins, ApoA-IV dissociates from chylomicrons and transfers to HDL (high density lipoprotein) particles or circulates in lipid-free form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The past several decades have witnessed numerous advances in identifying physiological functions of ApoA-IV. For instance, ApoA-IV may protect against atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], mediate reverse cholesterol transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], act as an anti-inflammatory agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and modulate intestinal lipid absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, little of these roles were unique to ApoA-IV or not shared by other members of the apolipoprotein family. These led to the creation of ApoA-IV knockout (KO) mice generated by gene targeting technique in 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most striking phenotype of ApoA-IV KO mice was a reduction in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. And subsequent studies on these KO mice showed more attractive functions of ApoA-IV, including that mediating chylomicron metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], modulating hepatic TG secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and improving glucose homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">However, the expression of the neighboring <italic>Apoc3</italic> gene that located in the same gene cluster (<italic>Apoa1</italic>/<italic>Apoc3</italic>/<italic>Apoa4</italic>) with <italic>Apoa4</italic>, was also markedly reduced due to the ApoA-IV KO. As a result, it is hard to determine whether the phenotypes of ApoA-IV KO mice are due solely to the absence of ApoA-IV or may also be related to the deficiency of ApoC-III. Furthermore, the accompanying decrease in ApoC-III expression in ApoA-IV KO mice should never be ignored. To investigate the exact roles of ApoA-IV, TALEN approach could be applied for generating a precise ApoA-IV knockout animal model. TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) are a widely applicable genome editing approach that have been used to introduce targeted genetic alterations in many model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. They comprise an endonuclease catalytic domain tethered to a modular DNA-binding domain that can be easily engineered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Due to their great promise and flexibility for genome editing, TALENs were the preferred gene knockout approach at the time we began our project.</p><p id="Par21">While rats and mice look similar, there are millions of years of evolution separating the rat and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the evolutionary distance between them may be as great as that between humans and Old World monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, rats are more human-like in many cases of physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. So using rats may offer better opportunities to uncover the precise roles of ApoA-IV. In the current study, we generated an ApoA-IV knockout rat model by TALEN approach, and then analyzed physiological properties and energy homeostasis of these ApoA-IV knockout rats. In addition, we also performed RNA-seq analysis in liver and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of rats at various ages. These data collectively suggest that ApoA-IV involves in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism of rats.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rats</title><p id="Par22"><italic>Apoa4</italic><sup>+/−</sup> Sprague-Dawlay rats were generated using TALEN approach by Beijing Biocytogen Co., Ltd.

The genotypes were confirmed by PCR analysis followed by Sanger sequencing and agarose electrophoresis (PCR forward primer: 5′-TATCCCAACTCCAACATCATCCA-3′, reverse primer: 5′-TCGCAGTCTGATCCCACTTACTT-3′). The knockout allele generated a band at 237 bp, while the wild-type allele was at 245 bp. All rats were housed in a temperature-controlled specific pathogen-free (SPF) barrier system, and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7 a.m.). All experiments were carried out on 8–16 weeks age-matched males unless otherwise indicated. Experimental rats were given <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to normal chow diet and sterile tap water, and were gently handled several times every week after weaning to reduce potential stress during tests.

Qualified total RNA was subjected to further purification using RNAClean XP Kit (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) and RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN, Germany). Highly abundant rRNAs were removed by poly (A) selection and the obtained mRNA was purified, fragmented, used to synthesize first- and second-strand cDNA followed by end repair and adenylation of 3′ ends. Unique adapters were then ligated to the samples followed by PCR amplification. RNA-seq libraries were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, USA) and qualified using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.

However, the present study found that ApoA-IV KO rats had significantly enhanced glucose tolerance, implying that ApoA-IV deficiency improves glucose homeostasis, which is opposite to that of ApoA-IV KO mice. This discrepancy might result from the accompanying deficiency of ApoC-III in ApoA-IV KO mice, which remains to be elucidated. But it is undoubted that ApoA-IV specific knockout rats offer more accurate results when assessing the particular roles of ApoA-IV.</p><p id="Par64">In consistent with an earlier study using ApoA-IV KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], we also found a significant increase in hepatic TG content in ApoA-IV KO rats. Hepatic steatosis arises from an imbalance between TG acquisition and removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the fasted state, hepatic TG were synthesized primarily from FFAs derived from adipose TG hydrolysis and <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The present study showed that several lipogenic genes were up-regulated in ApoA-IV KO rats, which drives hepatic <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis. Moreover, the elevated glycolysis provided more substrates for the usage of lipogenesis, which also contributed to the formation of hepatic TG. Although the previous study on ApoA-IV KO mice indicated that the expression of lipogenic genes were not altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], another study showed that the lipogenic genes tended to be up-regulated upon ApoA-IV deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. And both studies have investigated the effects of ApoA-IV ablation on hepatic VLDL secretion rate but failed to reach a consensus. We can conclude from these two studies that ApoA-IV deficiency decreases hepatic VLDL size but increases chylomicron size. It seems incompatible because there is an overlap in the particle diameters between chylomicron and VLDL.</p><p id="Par65">The present results of RNA-seq analysis indicate that the expression patterns of the genes mentioned in this study were independent of developmental ages, because the gene expression trends between KO and WT rats were similar among the three age groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and b and Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c and d). But the mechanisms by which ApoA-IV regulates the gene expression remain to be elucidated.
