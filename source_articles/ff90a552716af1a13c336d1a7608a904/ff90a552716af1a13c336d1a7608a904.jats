Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease, and evidence suggest that inflammatory conditions act cumulatively, contributing to disease onset. Here we investigated whether infection early in life can contribute to synapse damage and cognitive impairment induced by amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs), neurotoxins found in AD brains. To this end, wild-type mice were subjected to neonatal (post-natal day 4) infection by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g), the main cause of infection in low-birth-weight premature infants in the US. <italic>E. coli</italic> infection caused a transient inflammatory response in the mouse brain starting shortly after infection. Although infected mice performed normally in behavioral tasks in adulthood, they showed increased susceptibility to synapse damage and memory impairment induced by low doses of AβOs (1 pmol; intracerebroventricular) in the novel object recognition paradigm. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that microglial cells from <italic>E. coli</italic>-infected mice undergo exacerbated activation when exposed to low doses of AβOs. In addition, treatment of infected pups with minocycline, an antibiotic that inhibits microglial pro-inflammatory polarization, normalized microglial response to AβOs and restored normal susceptibility of mice to oligomer-induced cognitive impairment. Interestingly, mice infected with by <italic>E. coli</italic> (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g) during adolescence (post-natal day 21) or adulthood (post-natal day 60) showed normal cognitive performance even in the presence of AβOs (1 pmol), suggesting that only infections at critical stages of development may lead to increased susceptibility to amyloid-β-induced toxicity. Altogether, our findings suggest that neonatal infections can modulate microglial response to AβOs into adulthood, thus contributing to amyloid-β-induced synapse damage and cognitive impairment.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41419_2019_Article_1529.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemistry, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Cell Biology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Immunology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Cell Culture</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Antibodies</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>Edited by D.

However, to date little is known about the influence of early life infections in the development of inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. In humans, a causal relation between neurodegenerative diseases and neonatal infections has proven difficult to establish due to the long time period between infection and the emergence of clinical symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although aging remains the most important risk factor for AD, increasing evidence suggest that cumulative environmental factors and poor lifestyle habits in different life stages contribute to disease development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Inflammation is a common denominator to several of these AD risk factors. Besides, it is now known that inflammation plays a central and dual role in Alzheimer’s pathology:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> while it is initially beneficial for clearance of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, central toxins that accumulate in AD brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, the sustained pro-inflammatory profile can be extremely deleterious to neuronal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we investigate whether an early-life infection increases susceptibility to cognitive impairment induced by low doses of amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs), neurotoxins found in AD brains during initial stages of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Wild-type mice were subjected to neonatal (post-natal day 4) infection by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the main cause of infection in low-birth-weight premature infants in the US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Our results show that early life <italic>E. coli</italic> infection causes an inflammatory response in the mouse brain starting shortly after infection. Although infected mice perform normally in behavioral tasks in adulthood, animals show increased susceptibility to synapse damage and cognitive impairment induced by low doses of AβOs injected into the lateral ventricle. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that microglial cells from <italic>E. coli</italic>-infected mice undergo exacerbated activation when exposed to low doses of AβOs. In addition, blockage of neonatal infection-induced microglial polarization to a pro-inflammatory profile leads to normalization of behavioral and cellular responses to AβOs in adult mice. Finally, persistent priming of microglial cells is specifically associated to infections taking place during the neonatal period, since injection of <italic>E. coli</italic> at later stages of development (adolescence and adulthood) did not affect susceptibility of mice to AβO-induced cognitive impairment. Altogether, our findings suggest that neonatal infections can modulate microglial response to AβOs in adult mice, thus contributing to amyloid-β-induced synapse damage and cognitive impairment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">In order to investigate whether an early life inflammatory event modulates the susceptibility of the brain to AβO-induced toxicity, we developed a mouse model of early-life <italic>E. coli</italic> infection. Initially, we determined the amount of <italic>E. coli</italic> that induced no long-term memory deficits or mortality in Swiss mice. Therefore, male pups injected with 0.5; 1 or 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g of <italic>E. coli</italic> s.c. at post-natal day 4 (P4) were tested in the novel object recognition task (NOR) at 90 days of age (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). As expected, animals that received a s.c. injection of sterile PBS (sPBS) spent significantly more time exploring the non-familiar than the familiar object used in test session, indicating that they successfully learned the task (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Conversely, male mice that received 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g of <italic>E. coli</italic> at P4 did not differentiate between familiar and novel objects presented in the test session (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, <italic>E. coli</italic> 2), indicating that this amount of bacteria induces persistent cognitive impairment <italic>per se</italic> in mice. Since lower amounts of <italic>E. coli</italic> (0.5 or 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g) had no persistent effect on cognition of adult mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; <italic>E. coli</italic> 0.5; <italic>E. coli</italic> 1), we chose the intermediate dose of <italic>E. coli</italic> (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g) for subsequent experiments. Curiously, female pups that received this amount of <italic>E. coli</italic> showed persistent cognitive impairment in the NOR task (Suppl.

High levels of bacterial RNA were found in brains of mice 1 h, but not 24 h, after infection at P4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

Of interest, experiments in animal models showed that neonatal insults, as ischemia, stroke or severe infections, were associated to altered brain response which persist until adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Here, we developed a model of neonatal s.c. <italic>E. coli</italic> infection that causes no mortality, body weight loss or detectable behavioral alterations in adult mice. Viable <italic>E. coli</italic> particles were found in blood of mice for at least 24 h after s.c. injection, indicating that this model is associated to systemic infection. Bacterial RNA was found in the brains of infected mice at a very early timepoint post-infection (1 h) and no consistent increase in blood brain barrier permeability was detected up to 24 h after infection. Bacteria dynamics in brain samples were reproduced in saline-perfused mice, suggesting that <italic>E. coli</italic> detected by qPCR did not correspond exclusively to circulating bacteria. Therefore, it is possible that <italic>E. coli</italic> reached the brain parenchyma without causing BBB disruption (possibly inside immune cells), or injected bacteria remains adhered to the epithelial lining of the choroid plexus and brain ventricles, since intense binding of <italic>E. coli</italic> was shown especially in neonatal rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. We further found that <italic>E. coli</italic> infection induced a transient shift to a pro-inflammatory profile in the developing brain.

In contrast to the effect of neonatal infections, we found that <italic>E. coli</italic> infection during later stages of development does not lead to hippocampal astrogliosis and microgliosis in mice. Altogether, these results strengthen the idea that there is a critical stage during development when the brain is more sensitive to the effects of pro-inflammatory peripheral stimuli.</p><p id="Par15">The observation that systemic inflammatory diseases can contribute to sporadic AD onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> has led to the hypothesis that periphery-derived pro-inflammatory molecules could also influence brain response to both physiological and pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. To date, a few clinical studies have suggested the existence of a relationship between systemic infections and different hallmarks of AD. The incidence of two or more unspecific infections over a period of 4 years was associated with an increased risk of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and a single episode of pneumonia resulted in an accelerated development of dementia in elderly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Other groups have used transgenic mouse models of AD to investigate whether perinatal infections contribute to AD progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. It is important to note that these studies were performed in animal models mimicking genetic, familial variants of AD, which are not always good representatives of sporadic AD development in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Of note, studies in healthy human subjects and mice have shown that Aβ peptide is constantly generated under physiological conditions in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.Moreover, since AD pathology is known to start many years before the clinical onset of symptoms, it is important to investigate whether systemic infections contribute to increase the risk of AD development, or only accelerate ongoing disease. Here, we report that a single exposure to <italic>E. coli</italic> during the neonatal period is sufficient to increase the susceptibility of mice to cognitive impairment and synapse loss after a single i.c.v. infusion of subtoxic doses of AβOs. Therefore, we speculate that early life infections could increase the risk to develop mild-cognitive impairment and AD, depending on the individual response to physiological generation of Aβ in the patients’ brains. This hypothesis should be further confirmed by additional epidemiological and experimental studies. Moreover, the timing of an immunological challenge is very important when considering possible lasting effects. Our results show that mice infected during adolescence or adulthood showed normal cognitive performance when AβOs are infused into the brain, in contrast to what was found following neonatal infection. Previous studies have found that <italic>E. coli</italic> adheres significantly more to the choroid plexus of neonatal rats compared to that of adult animals, under identical experimental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In agreement with these findings, we found that when adolescent mice are infected s.c. with <italic>E. coli</italic>, bacteria are not detectable in the brain by qPCR either 1 or 24 h after infection, in contrast to our results following infection in neonatal mice. These findings highlight that infections during the neonatal period have larger potential to cause long-lasting impact on brain and behavior.</p><p id="Par16">Despite the evidence of serious late effects caused by early-life infections on the developing brain, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.

Similar results were seen in all hippocampal subregions, suggesting that there is not a subpopulation of microglial cells which is particularly sensitive to the effects of neonatal <italic>E. coli</italic> infection. In addition, we found that by blocking microglial activation shortly after infection with minocycline, we were able to restore normal susceptibility of these cells when animals were exposed to subtoxic doses of AβOs later in life, and this also led to normalized memory function in the presence of low doses of Aβ oligomers. These results strengthen the hypothesis that neonatal infection induces microglial priming, and that overactivation of these primed cells in response to low amounts of AβOs later in life leads to cognitive impairment.</p><p id="Par17">It is known that early-life stressors may have differential impacts on subjects of both sexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.

Preliminary tests showed that none of the objects used in our experiments evoked innate preference. Before training, each animal was submitted to a 5-min-long habituation session, in which they were allowed to freely explore the empty arena. During this habituation session, total distance traveled was measured using Anymaze software (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL), to verify possible effects of treatments on locomotor behavior. Training consisted of a 5 min-long session during which animals were placed at the center of the arena in the presence of two identical objects. Time spent exploring each object was recorded. Sniffing and touching the objects were considered as exploratory behavior. The arena and objects were thoroughly cleaned between trials with 70% ethanol to eliminate olfactory cues. Two hours after training, animals were again placed in the arena for a 5 min-long test session, and one of the objects used in the training session was replaced by a new one. Again, time spent exploring each object was recorded. Results were expressed as percentage of time exploring each object during the training or test sessions and were analyzed using a one-sample Student’s <italic>t</italic> test comparing the mean exploration time for each object with the fixed value of 50 (50%, i.e., no differentiation between objects).
