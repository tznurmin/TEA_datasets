Characterizing the potential future morbidity and mortality burden of EH and EP and associated costs, as well as uncertainties in the estimates, can identify areas for public health intervention and inform adaptation strategies. We demonstrate a burden of disease and uncertainty assessment using data from Michigan, USA, and provide approaches for deriving these estimates for locations lacking certain data inputs.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Case-crossover analysis adapted from previous Michigan-specific modeling was used to characterize the historical EH-mortality relationship by county poverty rate and age group. Historical EH-associated hospitalization and emergency room visit risks from the literature were adapted to Michigan. In the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s BenMAP software, we used a novel approach, with multiple spatially-varying exposures, to estimate all non-accidental mortality and morbidity occurring on EH days (EH days; days where maximum temperature 32.2–35 C or &gt; 35 C) and EP days. We did so for two time periods: the “historical” period (1971–2000), and the “projected” period (2041–2070), by county.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The rate of all non-accidental mortality associated with EH days increased from 0.46/100,000 persons historically to 2.9/100,000 in the projected period, for 240 EH-attributable deaths annually. EH-associated ED visits increased from 12/100,000 persons to 68/100,000 persons, for 7800 EH-attributable emergency department visits. EP-associated ED visits increased minimally from 1.7 to 1.9/100,000 persons. Mortality and morbidity were highest among those aged 65+ (91% of all deaths). Projected health costs are dominated by EH-associated mortality ($280 million) and EH-associated emergency department visits ($14 million). A variety of sources contribute to a moderate-to-high degree of uncertainty around the point estimates, including uncertainty in the magnitude of climate change, population composition, baseline health rates, and exposure-response estimates.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The approach applied here showed that health burden due to climate may significantly rise for all Michigan counties by midcentury. The costs to health care and uncertainties in the estimates, given the potential for substantial attributable burden, provide additional information to guide adaptation measures for EH and

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par22">In this changing climate, state and local health departments in the USA and elsewhere are considering how best to protect the public’s health. Approaches to estimate future burden of disease of climate-related health outcomes and the associated costs and uncertainties can guide planning and fiscal policy. Detailed examples of how these approaches can be applied in a specific place--in this case, Michigan, USA--offer a template for their use elsewhere.</p><p id="Par23">During a strategic planning initiative in 2010, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Climate and Health Adaptation Program identified specific health outcomes as priority concerns when considering the impacts from climate change in Michigan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], including but not limited to heat-related illnesses and waterborne diseases. These effects were chosen based on evidence that Michigan-specific climate change effects include increases in EH events and increases in extreme precipitation (EP) events and concomitant flooding events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Following this scoping phase, we estimated the present and future burden of disease associated with these health outcomes. We followed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention technical guidance for health departments for projecting climate-related disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] by, 1) developing a causal pathway linking exposures/environmental hazards to health outcomes, 2) using ensemble projections from global climate models (GCMs) to identify how the exposures/environmental hazards may change in intensity and duration in the future, 3) establishing the historical disease burdens of the health outcomes in our populations, 4) assessing the historical exposure-outcome associations, 5) estimating the health burdens historically and in the projected climate, and then 6) evaluating the uncertainty inherent in the derivation of these different estimates.. The results will help prioritize county level measures to better protect public health in a changing climate. We also present our methods as a model to other states and municipalities, including methods for deriving baseline health data and exposure-response estimates when these are lacking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par25">An overview of the methods is provided below and summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

These were derived under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario, which is one of the more dire scenarios and assumes greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The historical EH data are the Maurer 1/8-degree gridded daily maximum temperature observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The projections were statistically-downscaled data sets from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] derived from Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 GCMs. Estimates of EH days were provided at a 1/8° grid resolution and were aggregated to match the spatial resolution of the health data (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Appendix 2 for aggregation details).</p><p id="Par28">No universal definition of EH exists, and the thresholds of 32.2 °C and 35 °C were chosen for two reasons. Firstly, these correspond to round Fahrenheit temperatures of 90 °F and 95 °F, and extreme caution is advised by the local Detroit National Weather Service office at temperatures over 90 °F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although these were well above the minimum-mortality-temperature thresholds of 21–24 °C identified in Gasparrini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] for cities in Michigan, the 32.2 °C threshold corresponds roughly to a Detroit heat-mortality threshold in Gronlund et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which used more recent, albeit more spatially constrained, mortality time series. Secondly, time series and case-crossover study designs, on which our estimates are based, can account for mortality displacements of 1–3 weeks, thereby subtracting out the mortality attributable to heat that was among very frail individuals who would have died within 1–3 weeks anyway. Beyond 3 weeks, we are not aware of research quantifying mortality displacement specific to cities in Michigan, although the extent of mortality displacement varies widely between countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

Therefore, projections of increases could reasonably range from almost no increase in EP days to twice as many days as projected by the ensemble climate projection.

With regards to historical EP exposure estimates, those used in deriving the precipitation exposure-response association were from single monitors rather than modeled data with high spatial resolution.

Although all of these studies show a leveling off of this decline in recent years, changes in the RRs or attributable deaths over time of 60–80% for the mortality outcomes suggest that change over time for all of the exposure-response associations remains a source of moderate uncertainty.</p><p id="Par76">External validity is another source of uncertainty in our EH-ED and EP-ED exposure-response estimates. For these estimates, we chose studies from similar climates, but population and infrastructure differences may affect the portability of RRs between two states. Michigan differs from Rhode Island in its demographic structure, with, for example, 14% vs. 8% of the population identifying as black [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. With regards to the EP exposure-response estimate, Michigan likely differs from Massachusetts in its water delivery infrastructure, its demographic structure, and the sensitivity of its population to waterborne pathogens.</p><p id="Par77">For EP, several studies of the association between precipitation and gastrointestinal illness did not find evidence of an association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Jagai et al. may have been able to detect this association because they stratified their analysis by CSO exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Additionally, in estimating the burden of disease, we applied RRs derived from a study defining EP at the 99th percentile of daily precipitation to exposure estimates of EP defined at the 98th percentile of daily precipitation, which might slightly overestimate the burden.</p><p id="Par78">Communities across the State of Michigan are in the process of eliminating CSOs. However, a recent study in Massachusetts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] found associations between sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and GI ED visits, suggesting that separating the sanitary and storm sewers will not entirely eliminate the pathway by which sewage can affect GI ED visits during future EP events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Monetary costs</title><p id="Par79">Our uncertainty in the costs associated with the historical and projected outcomes was moderate to high. For the costs associated with EH-attributable mortality, we were limited in our lack of estimates of years-of-life-lost. The time series and case-crossover study designs, on which our estimates were based, cannot estimate by how many months or years the deaths were advanced. Our approach of using the reduced life expectancies among individuals who die of cardiovascular or respiratory diseases attempts to account for this, but uncertainty in the degree of mortality displacement remains high. Uncertainty in the cost of a life-year is also high, with a reported range of $65,000 to $490,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For the morbidities, uncertainties in the estimated costs were moderate. The reported ranges were less than ±50% around the point estimates for hospitalization costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], but we are uncertain as to how well the estimates reflected the cost of an EH-associated visit that was not necessarily coded as heat-related. Specifically, we used heat-related hospitalization costs to estimate EH-associated renal and respiratory hospitalizations, and we used non-accidental ED visit costs to estimate ED visits that were presumably triggered by EH.</p><p id="Par80">We have additional uncertainty in projecting the costs given trends in medical costs over time. For example, in 2011 dollars, the average cost of an ED visit for individuals age 65 and older increased 40% over just 10 years from $630 in 2001 to $880 in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Similarly, daily inpatient costs increased 30% from $2400 to $3200.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec46" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par81">The health burden due to EH and EP may significantly rise for all Michigan counties by midcentury, with the greatest mortality and ED-burden in the southeast. To provide a sense of the public health significance of our projections, the projected combined EH- and EP-attributable ED burden in Southeast Michigan, as high as 0.97/1000 persons, is not as high as the 2012–2013 national motor-vehicle accident ED visit rate of 10/1000 persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], but it is comparable to the 2014 national ED-visit rate for miscarriages of 1.2/1000 persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Adaptation measures against extreme temperatures are needed to protect health, such as targeted public health monitoring, expanded access to air conditioning, and reductions in the urban heat island effect. Health protection of older adults should be prioritized in public health planning given the large burden among those aged 65 and older.</p><p id="Par82">These estimates represent the total non-accidental effects of EH as identified in the Michigan-specific causal pathway, including effects which may be mediated by ozone. It is not likely that ozone strongly mediates the EH-mortality or EH-hospitalization effects given that its inclusion in models of the association between EH and mortality and hospitalizations in Michigan did not affect the estimates of the EH effects by more than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We did not have projected increases in ozone concentrations and could not estimate its projected direct effect, independent of EH. However, a projection of mortality in 2041–2050 due to ozone in 19 communities in the Southeastern U.S. found a small, 0.43 ppb increase in average ozone concentration due to climate change as compared to concentrations in 2000 and a concomitant 0.01% increase in the mortality rate attributable to climate-change related increases in ozone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. A study of the New York City metropolitan region projected a 7.3% increase in ozone-related asthma emergency department visits among children by the 2020s as compared to 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], suggesting modest independent effects of ozone.</p><p id="Par83">In addition to potential increases in ozone, some of the historical and projected ED visits which we attributed to EH may be among individuals experiencing asthma exacerbations. Several studies have found associations between temperature and asthma symptoms or ED visits. Winquist et al. found a 6% increase in the risk of ED visits for asthma among children in Atlanta at the 75th vs. 25th percentile of daily maximum temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In Australia, Li et al. found increased reports of wheeze/chest tightness and cough/phlegm with increasing temperatures in a cohort of 270 children with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], and pediatric ED visits for chronic lower respiratory diseases increased in association with high temperatures in a separate study in Brisbane, Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Hospitalizations were increased for asthma and other respiratory conditions in New York City [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. An evaluation of pediatric records from a Detroit hospital found an additional 1.8 asthma ED visits for a 10 °F increase in temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. We did not quantify the specific morbidity burden of asthma attributable to EH, but given the high prevalence of asthma in the State of Michigan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], EH-associated asthma morbidity may be of particular concern in Michigan with climate change.</p><p id="Par84">Although reviews on preterm birth and heat published prior to this project’s scoping phase suggested that the association was unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], several studies have been published more recently indicating an association between birth outcomes and heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Future burden of disease assessments in Michigan should consider birth outcomes, particularly in light of the high baseline preterm birth rate in Detroit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Similarly, we did not identify injuries, including occupational injury not listed as heat-related, or self-inflicted injuries as EH-associated concerns in the scoping phase. Recent research indicates significant associations of non-heat-related injuries with EH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], and future Michigan climate burden of disease assessments should consider EH-associated injuries.</p><p id="Par85">Climate change may have significant impacts on public health beyond EH and EP impacts beyond those quantified in this paper. Notably, pollen levels are expected to increase in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Temperature and precipitation, as well as carbon dioxide concentrations, affect the levels of several types of tree and grass pollen, and this may lead to increases in allergic respiratory morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Furthermore, the pollen season length is increasing with climate change, although research on pollen trends is lacking due to a lack of consistent pollen monitoring over a long timescale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Future research should address the impacts of higher pollen levels on asthma and allergy incidence and exacerbation.</p><p id="Par86">We have only calculated the EP-attributable burden of GI illness related to ED visits. Most people experiencing GI illness do not seek treatment in EDs or medical care of any kind. Using a variety of surveillance systems, Mead et al. estimated that the average person experiences 1.05 episodes of GI illness annually characterized by diarrhea, vomiting or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. By this estimate, GI-related ED visits <italic>underestimate</italic> the total burden of GI-related illness by a factor of 100, and our estimate of the burden of GI illness attributable to EP is severely underestimated by our EP-attributable burden of GI-related ED visits. Furthermore, our quantitative EP estimate may not have accounted for the effects of harmful algal blooms, which may affect Michigan and Massachusetts drinking water delivery systems differently.</p><p id="Par87">We did not project increases in legionellosis with EP given the inconsistency in the literature in associations between legionellosis and precipitation. However, some of the studies suggested a greater importance of temperature and humidity than EP in legionellosis incidence, and confidence that temperature will increase with climate change is high.</p><p id="Par88">Several limitations to our estimates of the burden of future EH and EP exist, largely stemming from uncertainty surrounding various model inputs. The uncertainty analysis indicated that our mortality projections are only mildly sensitive to different population assumptions. Other inputs, including the exposure data and exposure-response function, carry greater uncertainty. A key limitation in our approach is the use of historical relationships for the estimation of future health effects without accounting for long-term adaptation to EH or EP. Physiological and behavioral adaptations have the potential to reduce the impact of extreme weather. Our results may therefore be regarded as a direr scenario where effective public health measures protecting individuals from extreme weather events have not been adopted.</p><p id="Par89">Additionally, our analysis does not fully account for uncertainty in climate models or future climate conditions. Our projections of EH days were derived using the high emissions A2 scenario, although the lower emissions scenarios are becoming statistically improbable given recent historic emissions trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Incorporating exposure projections derived from alternate, low emissions scenarios would likely result in lower mortality estimates. On the other hand, evidence from other studies suggests that mortality and morbidity increase at less extreme temperatures in temperate climates such as Michigan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This would imply that our results underestimate the total number of deaths and ED visits associated with this climate scenario.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par90">Under a dire climate change scenario, we estimated a Michigan-wide increase in EH-associated mortality from 0.46/100,000 persons historically to 2.9/100,000 in the projected period for $280 million in costs. We estimated a more substantial increase in EH-associated ED visits from 12/100,000 persons to 68/100,000 persons, for 7800 EH-attributable emergency department visits and $14 million in costs. EP-associated ED visits increased minimally from 1.7 to 1.9/100,000 persons, although this quantitative estimate did not include self-treated gastroenteritis or sufficiently represent the range of health problems from harmful algal blooms, flooding, and legionellosis. With the use of a high-emissions climate scenario and the exclusion of adaptation in the model we may over-estimate the future burden due to extreme temperatures in Michigan, but the exclusion of health effects from moderate heat, pollen, and precipitation-associated respiratory effects as well as any non-emergent health effects may result in substantial underestimation of both the present and future burden of climate in Michigan. Further research should investigate the association between moderate heat, precipitation, pollen, and health to gain a more complete picture of Michigan’s climate-related disease burden. Our finding of a notable burden of mortality and morbidity attributable to EH, without assumptions about adaptation, stresses the importance of actions to protect health against the adverse health effects of EH. Additionally, although the uncertainty in the GI-illness projections is high, the health risks of poor public drinking water quality that can result from harmful algal blooms and storm-related emergencies are clear. In these emergencies, access to clean water for drinking and bathing can become challenges, and preparations for increases in EP events should focus on distribution of clean, potable water in emergencies to affected residents to avoid waterborne illnesses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>We thank Daniel Brown and William “B.J.” Baule of the Great Lakes Integrated Sciences + Assessments Center, Richard Pollman of the National Weather Service, Neal Fann of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Lily Tyndall Snow of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for their generous and prompt sharing of data and insights.</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par91">This work was supported by a Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research Postdoctoral Translational Scholars Fellowship (2UL1TR000433–06), National Institutes of Health grants K99ES026198 and P30 ES017885; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health grant T42 OH008455–09, and Cooperative Agreement Number EH001124 from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
