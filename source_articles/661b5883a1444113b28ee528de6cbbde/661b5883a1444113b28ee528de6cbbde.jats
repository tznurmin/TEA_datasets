However, the mechanisms of BBR in regulating GK are still unknown. Here, we found that BBR upregulated GK immunofluorescence expression in AML12 cells cultured in high glucose and increased glycogen content simultaneously. BBR improved hyperglycemia in <italic>db/db</italic> mice, and increased liver glucose-6-phosphate/glucose-1-phosphate (G-6-P/G-1-P) was found by analyzing metabolites (serum, liver, and feces) based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics. Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) assessment revealed enriched BBR distribution in the liver, and liver G-6-P had the same trend as the concentration-time curve of BBR. G-6-P is solely catalyzed by GK, and GK activity and expression showed a positive correlation with liver BBR levels. In <italic>db/db</italic> mice, BBR also upregulated GK in liver fractions (cytoplasm and nucleus) and liver glycogen content. GK functionally worked by dissociating from GK regulatory protein (GKRP), and although GKRP expression was not affected, we found a decreased ratio of GK binding with GKRP in BBR treated <italic>db/db</italic> mice. In conclusion, our study suggests the dissociation of GK from GKRP as the potential mechanism for liver GK increase upon BBR treatment, which contributes to the anti-diabetic effect of BBR.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The emergence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a global pandemic is one of the major challenges to human health in the 21st century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In 2015, 415 million people suffered from diabetes worldwide (IDF, 2015)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and diabetes is estimated to be a heavy burden on health care in future decades.</p><p id="Par3">The liver plays a crucial role in controlling glucose homeostasis by coordinating the metabolism, synthesis, storage, and redistribution of nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In postprandial status, the liver contributes to the disposal of enteral glucose loads by enhancing glycogen synthesis and suppressing hepatic glucose export<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In the fasting state, the liver produces glucose by glycogenolysis to maintain euglycemia. These physiological processes are dysregulated in T2DM, and this imbalance contributes to hyperglycemia in both postprandial and fasting states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Hepatic glycogen thus delicately coordinates the release of glucose from the liver and regulates the homeostasis of glucose metabolism.</p><p id="Par4">The transport of glucose into hepatocytes occurs through glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2). Glucose can freely exit hepatocytes without transformation, and once it enters the cell, glucose will transform into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) to limit its outflow. The transformation of glucose to G-6-P in hepatocytes is catalyzed solely by glucokinase (GK), which works as the gatekeeper for glucose metabolism in hepatocytes. G-6-P can be either further transformed to glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) and synthesized into glycogen for storage or utilized by the cell via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway. The activator of GK is reported to increase liver glucose uptake in male Sprague-Dawley and Zucker diabetic fatty rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, indicating that GK could be a promising target for hyperglycemia. GK activity is largely regulated by its subcellular localization. Physiologically, GK regulatory protein (GKRP) binds to GK in the nucleus when concentrations of glucose are low, and dissociation occurs under high-glucose conditions; however, this coordination is damaged in diabetic status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Control of T2DM is urgent, and available agents include insulin sensitizers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, insulinotropic peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and glucose absorption inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, among others. However, these strategies have limitations, and the long-term effect is far from ideal, making new agents greatly needed. In recent years, the interest in natural products that treat T2DM has grown. Berberine (BBR, C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>18</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>), a pharmacological component principally isolated from <italic>Rhizoma coptidis</italic> Franch. (family <italic>Ranunculaceae</italic>), which has long been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating infectious diarrhea, has now been identified as a potential treatment for T2DM. Both clinical investigations and animal studies have confirmed its role in lowering blood glucose and improving related metabolic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">While the effect of BBR on T2DM has been confirmed, numerous studies have reported the possible mechanisms of BBR according to respective design and experiment data, making the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of BBR debatable. In alloxan-induced diabetic mice, it was reported that BBR increased GK expression and activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, indicating GK as the possible target of BBR. However, this finding has not been verified by other studies, and the regulation mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, we used AML12 cells and diabetic <italic>db/db</italic> mice to investigate GK expression upon BBR treatment, applied metabolomics, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) assessment and molecular biological techniques to explore the regulatory mechanisms of BBR on GK. Our data might provide a systematic understanding of GK regulation under the anti-diabetic effect of BBR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>BBR increased GK expression and glycogen content in AML12 cells</title><p id="Par7">To investigate the role of BBR in GK expression, we cultured AML12 cells in high-glucose medium, treated the cells with BBR (1 μM, 5 μM, or 20 μM) for 24 h, and observed the GK fluorescence intensity. This revealed that 20 μM BBR significantly increased GK expression, while the effect of low concentration (1 μM and 5 μM) BBR on GK was negligible (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). GK is the catalyzing enzyme of glucose metabolism in hepatocytes and contributes to glycogen synthesis. We also detected glycogen content, and glycogen content was significantly increased with 20 μM BBR treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining of the cells further confirmed increased glycogen distribution under microscope observation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>BBR promoted GK expression in AML12 cells.

In the 1980s, Chinese researchers accidentally discovered that T2DM patients took BBR as a folk recipe to control their blood glucose, and a small sample investigation further confirmed its effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. From that time, studies of BBR as a T2DM remedy have spread globally.

Diabetic <italic>db/db</italic> mice are the most commonly mice used in T2DM studies. Researchers have also found that adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in adipocytes and muscle can be activated by BBR, thus promoting peripheral glucose uptake and contributing to its hypoglycemic effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.
