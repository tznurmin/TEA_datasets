To address this, we utilised longitudinal samples from a large-scale population study of wild koalas in south-east Queensland, to follow chlamydial infections over time and to investigate some of the drivers of disease progression. Our findings show, firstly, that almost two thirds of chlamydial infections progressed to disease, challenging the notion that chlamydial infections in koalas commonly remain chronic and asymptomatic. Secondly, disease progression at the urogenital tract site was associated with infection load, and urogenital tract shedding was significantly higher when koalas acquired a new infection. Thirdly, chronic chlamydial exposure was not necessary for pathogenic sequelae to develop, such as infertility and mortality. Fourthly, <italic>omp</italic>A-characterised strain sub-types may reflect tissue tropisms and pathogenicity, and the chlamydial status of some chronically infected koalas may be explained by reinfections with novel genotypes. Finally, successful antimicrobial treatment provided only short-term protection against reinfection and disease progression in susceptible koalas. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and preventing chlamydial infections in koalas, informing new population management strategies and research priorities.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of the Sunshine Coast (USC)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001796</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_49382.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Australia’s northern koala populations are being pushed towards extinction by ongoing habitat degradation due to urban and agricultural development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, and as they decline, the threat of chlamydial disease is likely to become more significant. Chlamydial disease has been shown to negatively impact the viability of declining koala populations due to effects on mortality and reproductive rates, with up to 57% of female koalas infertile in some populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and disease identified as the largest single contributor to mortality in others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Chlamydial disease control has subsequently been identified as a potential population management tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and successful conservation outcomes have been demonstrated with this approach. For example, a reduction in the prevalence of chlamydial disease in a declining south-east Queensland (SE Qld) koala population, from 20% to 4%, contributed to positive population growth rates after management interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Two species of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infect koalas, <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>C. pecorum</italic>, but disease is predominantly associated with <italic>C. pecorum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Chlamydial infections in koalas, as with other hosts, are often characterised by asymptomatic carriage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, in susceptible individuals, they can cause inflammatory and fibrotic disease in the urinary and reproductive tracts, at the ocular site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and occasionally in the respiratory tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Attempts have been made to identify the factors that drive chlamydial disease progression in these individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, however, despite its importance, a comprehensive understanding of chlamydial epidemiology and disease dynamics in koalas is lacking.</p><p id="Par3">Previously suggested drivers of chlamydial disease progression in koalas include several pathogen-associated factors, such as the chlamydial strain and infection load. Chlamydial disease prevalence and severity varies between koala populations, with a higher prevalence and severity reported in the northern part of Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. One hypothesis to explain this pattern of disease occurrence is the geographical distribution of genetically distinct chlamydial strains, as characterised by chlamydial outer membrane protein A (<italic>omp</italic>A) genotyping. Victorian koalas, for example, are largely infected with apparently less pathogenic strains, characterised as <italic>omp</italic>A genotype B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In SE Qld koalas, however, strains with specific <italic>omp</italic>A genotypes have previously not been associated with a significant risk of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The relationship between the chlamydial infection load and disease progression in koalas is also unclear, with a significant association reported in only one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> of two studies from the same region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, the former study included data from hospitalised koalas, which may have biased the findings. Although these pathogen-associated factors are likely to be important in chlamydial disease progression, our understanding of their role is clearly limited, and chlamydial pathogenesis may also be dependent on several host-associated factors.</p><p id="Par4">Host-associated factors, such as host genetics, immune phenotype, coinfection with immunosuppressive pathogens (such as koala retrovirus, KoRV), and the physiological response to stress, have also been suggested as drivers of chlamydial disease progression in koalas. Host genetics are known to contribute to chlamydial pathogenesis, with three major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) variants being correlated with chlamydial disease in koalas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, high antibody titres against chlamydial heat shock proteins, associated with chlamydial disease in other host species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, were identified in koalas with tubal infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Links have also been established between KoRV-B and chlamydial disease in SE Qld koalas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and KoRV-A and cystitis in Victorian koalas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Alternatively, the complementary geographical distribution of KoRV infections may explain the variability in chlamydial disease prevalence and severity between northern and southern koala populations. The physiological response to chronic stressors might also influence susceptibility to chlamydial disease, due to effects on immune function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, while there was a higher prevalence of chlamydial infections in overabundant Victorian koalas residing in a highly disturbed environment, this was not true for chlamydial disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The interactions between these host and pathogen-associated drivers of chlamydial disease progression are clearly complex, and further research is needed to determine the relative contribution of each factor.</p><p id="Par5">Much of our current understanding of chlamydial epidemiology and disease dynamics in koalas has been derived from opportunistic, cross-sectional field studies or hospital data sets. Historically, field studies are likely to have severely underestimated the prevalence of chlamydial disease in wild koala populations, limited by a lack of comprehensive clinical examinations that included ultrasonography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Further, field studies do not always examine all chlamydial-affected anatomical sites or both sexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and because of their opportunistic or cross-sectional nature, do not provide comprehensive data sets on chlamydial epidemiology and disease dynamics over time. The sensitivity and discriminatory power of diagnostic capabilities for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> has also drastically improved with the recent development of species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> genotyping methods. The historical reliance in chlamydial research on hospital data sets, due to the costs associated with large-scale population studies of wild koalas, has also confounded the data, as these are inherently biased towards koalas showing overt signs of disease or residing near human habitation or roads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. To develop an accurate and thorough understanding of chlamydial epidemiology and disease dynamics in koalas, comprehensive, longitudinal population studies are required.</p><p id="Par6">To address some of these limitations, we utilised a unique, large-scale, longitudinal data set from SE Qld koalas that included comprehensive, standardised clinical examinations and molecular diagnostics to investigate some of the factors driving chlamydial disease progression.

These koalas had no evidence of chlamydial infection (qPCR below detection limit) or disease (clinical examination within normal limits) at their previous clinical examination.

For the remaining 16% (6/38) of these infections, the infection was present for one or more consecutive clinical examinations (2.5 to 18 months previously) before disease was detected at the same anatomical site.

To stabilise these populations, greater investment in population management strategies is necessary. The efficiency and success of such management strategies rely, in part, on a thorough understanding of chlamydial epidemiology and disease dynamics. Due to the paucity of comprehensive, longitudinal population studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, largely resulting from historical limitations in the diagnosis of chlamydial infection and disease and the expense associated with such research, this knowledge is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we utilised a unique data set from a wild koala population in SE Qld to reveal several new, major findings. Firstly, almost two thirds of the chlamydial infections detected and monitored in the population, progressed to chlamydial disease, challenging the notion that the majority of chronic chlamydial infections in koalas do not progress to clinical disease. Secondly, disease progression at the urogenital tract site was associated with the chlamydial infection load, and shedding from the urogenital tract was significantly higher in recently infected koalas. Thirdly, repeated or ongoing chlamydial exposure to did not appear to be necessary for negative sequelae to develop, such as infertility and mortality. Fourthly, some strains, as characterised by <italic>omp</italic>A genotyping, reflected possible tissue tropisms and pathogenicity, and reinfections with novel genotypes may have been responsible for some long-term infections. Finally, successful antimicrobial treatment provided only short-term protection against reinfection and subsequent disease progression in susceptible koalas.</p><p id="Par28">In contrast to the current paradigm derived from opportunistic, cross-sectional studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, when monitored longitudinally, we found that only 5% of chlamydial infections remained chronic and asymptomatic in this SE Qld koala population. Instead, our data show that 66% of chlamydial infections progressed to disease and the remaining 29% of infections were resolved by the koala between clinical examinations, without progressing to detectable disease. Further, in 67% of koalas with long-term chlamydial infections, we observed genetically distinct chlamydial strains, as characterised by their <italic>omp</italic>A genotypes, between clinical examinations. This suggests that koalas with long-term chlamydial infections may have been repeatedly resolving their infections before being reinfected with novel genotypes or shifting between different dominant genotypes in a mixed infection. Across a range of hosts, chlamydial infections have often been characterised by prolonged carriage in a latent form, without causing disease, or exerting only subclinical effects on the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, even for the minority of koalas that had long-term, asymptomatic infections in our study, it is possible that subtle disease may have been overlooked during their clinical examinations due to limitations in the sensitivity of ultrasonography alone at detecting reproductive tract disease in both male and female koalas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. If the threat of chlamydial disease is to be successfully managed for koalas, these discoveries support a move away from the reliance on a clinical diagnosis for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> in both wildlife hospital and field settings and demonstrate the importance of access to point-of-care molecular diagnostics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This will enable the identification of infections in a timely fashion, allowing veterinary interventions to avert disease progression and negative sequelae.</p><p id="Par29">Determining the specific factors that drive chlamydial disease progression in susceptible individuals is an important priority in chlamydial research. We found that urogenital tract disease progression was significantly associated with the chlamydial infection load at that anatomical site, and that koalas with high infection loads at their urogenital tract site progressed to disease more rapidly. Further, our data show that infection loads at the urogenital tract site were significantly higher when koalas acquired an infection in the preceding three months, with loads then declining to a relatively stable level in chronically infected koalas. Shedding of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is likely to be governed by the effectiveness of the host immune response and pathogen growth kinetics, and further focused study investigating the host immune response and levels of shedding during infection would be valuable. We also found that effective antibiotic treatment of chlamydial disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> conferred only short-term immunity to reinfection, even by the same <italic>omp</italic>A-characterised chlamydial strain. Consistent with the theory that immune-mediated pathogenesis is a driver of the severity of chlamydial disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, ‘severe’ chlamydial disease was associated with prior chlamydial exposure. Some koalas, however, developed negative sequelae such as infertility and mortality, without prior or ongoing exposure to <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, demonstrating that severe immune-mediated disease can also occur in naïve individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Together, these findings highlight the fact that both new and repeated chlamydial infections can have serious consequences, and management interventions that reduce the transmission of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and improve immune responses, such as vaccination, will be important in the future.</p><p id="Par30">Several studies have suggested that genetically distinct chlamydial strains, as characterised by <italic>omp</italic>A genotypes, may reflect both tissue tropisms and pathogenicity in koalas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, demonstrating the complexity of chlamydial pathogenesis. Interestingly, only genotypes G and E′ were detected at the ocular site in our study, and the restricted distribution of genotypes at the ocular site relative to the urogenital tract site suggests there may be some genotype-specific tissue tropisms of <italic>C. pecorum</italic> in koalas. This is consistent with the findings of Phillips <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> in koalas and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> research in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our data also show that koalas infected with <italic>omp</italic>A genotype F and F′ strains at the urogenital tract site and genotype E′ strains at the ocular site were significantly more likely to progress to disease at their respective anatomical sites. In addition, these <italic>omp</italic>A-characterised strains resulted in infection loads that were a log higher than other genotypes, suggesting that they might be more pathogenic. This finding is consistent with hospital-based studies that identified strains denoted <italic>omp</italic>A genotype F in 7/8 diseased koalas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and strains denoted <italic>omp</italic>A genotype F as the most widely distributed genotype in urogenital tract samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Further, Legione <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> reported higher chlamydial infection loads in Victorian koalas infected with genotype F strains at the urogenital tract site, but it was not clear whether those koalas were also diseased.

Similar differences in <italic>in vitro</italic> growth rates have been reported for ocular and genital strains of koala <italic>C. pecorum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and continuing investigation into strain-associated tissue tropisms and pathogenicity of <italic>C. pecorum</italic> in koalas is warranted.</p><p id="Par31">A limitation of this study was that infecting chlamydial strains were characterised by genotyping using amplicon sequencing of the <italic>omp</italic>A gene. This method may have biased the findings towards infections containing a single population of genetically distinct <italic>C. pecorum</italic>, or more likely, towards the dominant genotype in infections containing mixed populations of genetically distinct <italic>C. pecorum</italic> strains. Culture-independent, probe-based genome capture and sequencing of clinical samples from koalas has shown that naturally occurring chlamydial infections frequently consist of mixed populations of genetically distinct <italic>C. pecorum</italic> strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In this study, amplified <italic>omp</italic>A sequences were not able to be resolved due to poor quality chromatograms in 29% and 9% of <italic>C. pecorum</italic> positive ocular and urogenital tract samples, respectively, and may indeed represent mixed infections. Whole genome sequencing could be employed to further characterise infecting chlamydial strains and assist in identifying mixed infections, however its application in large sample sizes is currently cost-prohibitive. As this method becomes more accessible in the future, it will improve our understanding of both the role of mixed genotype infections in chlamydial pathogenicity and tissue tropisms, and whether long-term infections with chlamydial strains that were genetically distinct over time were due to repeated resolution and reinfection or chlamydial strain dynamics of mixed infections.</p><p id="Par32">In conclusion, most of the published literature on chlamydial epidemiology and disease dynamics in koalas originates from data sets that fail to accurately represent these interactions in wild koala populations. Instead, our current study utilised a comprehensive, longitudinal data set from a wild koala population in SE Qld to reveal several key findings. Our findings demonstrate the importance of point-of-care molecular diagnostics that enable the prompt detection of chlamydial infections, so that chlamydial disease progression can be prevented with veterinary interventions such as antimicrobial treatment or vaccination. These findings also support further investigation of vaccination programs that aim to reduce transmission of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> in at-risk populations and thereby improve population viability. Finally, we provide new focus for future chlamydial research across a range of hosts, including humans, to elucidate the host-associated factors that contribute to resistance to chlamydial disease progression and the chlamydial strains with increased pathogenicity and tissue tropisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par33">A koala management program was conducted as part of a large-scale infrastructure project in SE Qld (27.0946°S, 152.9206°E) between 2013 and 2017.
