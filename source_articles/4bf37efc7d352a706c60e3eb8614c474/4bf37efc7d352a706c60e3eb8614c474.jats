This profile is compatible with the cellular exhaustion previously shown in human visceral leishmaniasis. The present study aimed to evaluate the <italic>in situ</italic> expression of cellular exhaustion markers and their relation to clinical signs, SWP disorganization and parasite load. Forty dogs naturally infected by <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> were grouped according to levels of SWP organization and parasite load. SWP disorganization was associated with reductions in the periarteriolar lymphatic sheath and lymphoid follicles/mm<sup>2</sup> and worsening of the disease. Apoptotic cells expressing CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> increased in dogs with disorganized SWP and a high parasite load. In the same group, PD-L1 and LAG-3 gene expression were reduced. A higher number of CD21<sup>+</sup>TIM-3<sup>+</sup> B cells was detected in disorganized spleens than in organized spleens. Apoptosis is involved in periarteriolar lymphatic sheath reduction and lymphoid follicle atrophy and is associated with CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> cell reductions in the splenic tissue of dogs with visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Failure to control the parasite load was observed, suggesting that cell exhaustion followed by T and B cell apoptosis plays a role in the immunosuppression observed in CVL.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Programa Cientista do Nosso Estado (Faperj -E-26/203.069/2016).</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_49344.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="AuthorContribution"><p>Renato Porrozzi and Fernanda Nazaré Morgado contributed equally.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a tropical and subtropical disease caused by <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic>, an intracellular protozoan that is transmitted to its vertebrate hosts by the blood feeding of female sand flies of the genera Phlebotomus and <italic>Lutzomyia</italic>. Dogs have been implicated as the main urban reservoir of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> and source of infection for the vector <italic>Lutzomyia longipalpis</italic>, the known vector in South America. Infected dogs present high parasite loads in the skin and blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and are major targets for control measures. Furthermore, dogs are considered good models for understanding the immunopathogenesis of ZVL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3"><italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> infection affects several organs in dogs, and the spleen is an important target. Notably, disorganization of the splenic white pulp (SWP) has been reported in naturally infected dogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, little is known about the mechanisms triggering splenic disorganization or the influence of parasites or the immune response on this process. The maintenance of the splenic microarchitecture and areas of segregation in the spleen is important for the activation of effector lymphocytes and for the development of specific immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It has been generally demonstrated that the progression of an <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> infection to active disease is characterized by a marked humoural response, depression of the cellular response against the parasite, and the emergence of clinical signs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Recent studies have correlated the progression of disease with the disorganization of the splenic microarchitecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, leading to increased parasite load and reduced expression of cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, which is compatible with the cellular exhaustion profile.</p><p id="Par4">T cell exhaustion is defined by decreased effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors and a transcriptional state distinct from that of functional effector or memory T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Cellular exhaustion characterized by programmed death 1 (PD-1) expression was first described in viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. PD-1 expression is induced by repeated antigenic stimulation in T and B lymphocytes, and this non-responsive state is termed exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The ligand of PD-1, PD-L1, is constitutively expressed by B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells in the spleen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Activation of PD-1 induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation as well as cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It was further demonstrated that exhaustion could be reversed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> by the administration of antibodies specific to the ligand (PD-L1), leading to recovery of the proliferative capacity of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, secretion of cytokines, elimination of infected cells and reduction in the viral load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The expression of PD-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) by peripheral and splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> cells has been demonstrated in human visceral leishmaniasis (VL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and in mice experimentally infected with <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>, another <italic>Leishmania</italic> species that causes VL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Administration of anti-CTLA-4 blocking antibodies <italic>in vivo</italic> led to increased frequencies of IFN-γ- and IL-4-producing cells in the liver and spleen of the experimentally infected mice and accelerated the development of the hepatic granulomatous response associated with a reduction in the parasite load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The emergence of exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> cells was accompanied by a reduction in inflammatory cytokine levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It has also been shown that receptor blockade does not influence IFN-γ production; however, in a murine experimental model, PD-L1 (B7-H1) blockade led to control of the parasite load even with unchanged induction of cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In an evaluation of splenic cells from patients with VL, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 pathways did not alter IFN-γ production or parasite survival <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that failures in mounting an effective immune response and in controlling the parasite load are associated with the disorganization of the SWP and cellular exhaustion in dogs presenting with VL. Thus, we evaluated the expression of the exhaustion markers PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, TIM-3 and LAG-3 in the spleen of dogs naturally infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> and correlated the results with the clinical signs, organization of the SWP and parasite load observed in the animals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Associations among clinical score, parasite load and SWP disorganization in dogs naturally infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic></title><p id="Par5">In the present study, 40 dogs naturally infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> were included. The six clinical signs most frequently observed in the dogs with ZVL were evaluated: onychogryphosis, keratoconjunctivitis, dermatitis, body condition score, lymphadenomegaly and alopecia. Considering the intensity of the clinical signs, the animals were grouped into low (n = 13), medium (n = 13) and high clinical score (n = 14) groups. According to the degree of SWP organization and the parasite load, the dogs were grouped as follows: 1- organized SWP and low parasite load (OL; n = 10); 2- disorganized SWP and low parasite load (DL; n = 22); and 3- disorganized SWP and high parasite load (DH; n = 8).</p><p id="Par6">The disorganization of the SWP was characterized by a reduction in the number and loss of compartmentalization of the lymphoid follicles, which were atrophied in the dogs with severe ZVL (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Moreover, there was a reduction in cell number in the periarteriolar lymphatic sheath, an area composed of T lymphocytes. This histopathological sign was observed in most animals (30/40, 75%). Furthermore, this alteration was associated with disease progression since the dogs with disorganized SWP showed significantly higher clinical scores than those with organized SWP (Mann-Whitney p = 0.0235) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD21<sup>+</sup> cells in the spleen of dogs naturally infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic></title><p id="Par7">CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD21<sup>+</sup> cells were detected in the red and white pulps of the spleen by immunohistochemistry (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,D,G</xref>).

Markers for the exhaustion phenotype were quantified, and the association of marker expression with clinical evaluation, organization of the SWP and parasite load were tested. The animals were grouped into low, medium and high clinical score groups. When these groups were compared, the number of IL-10<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly lower in the animals with higher clinical scores (medium and high) than in the animals with low clinical scores. A previous study showed a reduction in the expression of IL-10 in animals with a high parasite load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The reduction in IL-10 expression observed in the present study was associated with cellular exhaustion processes defined by the expression of different markers, such as PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and TIM-3. Interestingly, IL-10 has been related to VL progression in some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, while conversely, others have found no association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In part, these conflicting results can be due to the model studied as well as the use of naturally infected animals, which prevents the verification of the time and evolution of the infection.</p><p id="Par19">A study based on the PD-1 receptor showed an association among the cellular exhaustion process, a reduction in proliferative capacity and a decline in cytokine levels in the peripheral blood of polysymptomatic animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In another study using a mouse model chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, the immune exhaustion process manifested in the early stages of infection, followed by increased expression of the PD-1 surface molecule induced by the pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated in mice infected with <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium vinckei</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> that as soon as 6 days after infection, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells start to express PD-1 and LAG-3, suggesting that the inhibition of immune responses via these receptors may occur immediately after the onset of T cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Although ZVL was already established in the dogs evaluated in the present study, results similar to those reported in the abovementioned works were observed: the dogs with organized spleens and low parasite loads expressed considerable numbers of PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA-4 and LAG-3. Activation of PD-1 induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation and cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, in the present study, PD-1<sup>+</sup> and LAG-3<sup>+</sup> cells was not detected in splenic tissue by immunohistochemistry, which could be explained by the low resolution of this technique. It is also possible that antigenic re-stimulation of these cells for several days may be needed to enable the detection of the PD-1 and LAG-3 receptors <italic>in situ</italic>. Previous studies that identified exhausted cells in dogs used flow cytometry and re-stimulated the cells for a few days before using them in the analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, it has been shown that the expression of PD-L1 in canine oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, haemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumour, mammary adenocarcinoma and prostate adenocarcinoma can be identified by immunohistochemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Human studies have reported a wide range of tissues that normally express PD-1 linker transcripts, with high levels of expression observed in the placenta, heart, lungs and liver and low levels of expression observed in the spleen, lymph nodes and thymus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In this study, CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> cells and the PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 and LAG-3 genes were expressed at lower levels in the groups with greater disorganization and higher parasite load in the spleen, with significant differences observed for CTLA-4, PD-L1 and LAG-3. In a study of a BALB/C mouse model infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic>, the authors observed an increase in CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> expression in the initial stages of infection, 24–48 hours after infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In the present study, we observed fewer CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> cells and decreased gene expression of the other exhaustion markers in the animals with disorganized SWP and high parasite load, possibly as a consequence of cell apoptosis, as the apoptotic profile was detected across all groups. The number of apoptotic cells was higher in the group presenting a low parasite load and in the group exhibiting disorganized white pulp than in the other groups. The lowest number of apoptotic cells was observed in the animals with disorganized spleen microarchitecture and high parasite load, a result similar to that observed for CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> cells and the mRNA expression of PD-1 and LAG-3. In addition, we observed that the majority of apoptotic cells in the spleen of dogs in the DH group were CTLA-4<sup>+</sup>. This finding corroborates the hypothesis that the lower number of exhausted cells observed in the DH group is due to cell death with the substantial reduction in cellularity leading to immunosuppression. In macrophages, the PD-1/SHP2 signalling axis has been reported to negatively regulate the activation of AKT and that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated induction of PD-1 expression contributes to apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Currently, the involvement of CTLA-4 in the induction of apoptosis is not well defined. In a murine model, the binding of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the CTLA-4 receptor on the surface of activated T cells has been shown to induce apoptosis in a Fas-independent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. CTLA-4 can trigger apoptosis in CTLA-4-expressing tumour cells after the cells interact with soluble CD80 or CD86 recombinant ligands, and the induction of apoptosis occurs through a caspase-8-dependent mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In dogs infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>, apoptosis has been observed in the lymph nodes and skin and is more frequently observed in organs with higher parasite loads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The liver and spleen of infected dogs with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> show a larger number of cells undergoing apoptosis (lymphocytes), suggesting that this process may contribute to the survival of <italic>Leishmania</italic> in these organs since lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis are not able to fight against parasites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. These results corroborate those of another study that observed apoptosis in T cells from the spleen and peripheral blood, suggesting that <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites can induce apoptosis in T cells in association with a decrease in cell-mediated immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Altogether, the data presented in this study suggest that apoptosis may be the mechanism involved in periarteriolar lymphatic sheath atrophy, lymphoid follicle atrophy, and the reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> cell numbers.</p><p id="Par20">The reduction in the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in the red pulp of animals in the DL group and the increase in these cells in the red pulp of animals in the DH group have been discussed in our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The accumulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in the red pulp of animals in the DH group was associated with atrophy of the periarteriolar lymphatic sheath. This finding suggests that these cells present defects in homing to their specific compartments in the white pulp and thus accumulate in the red pulp, where they eventually undergo apoptosis. In other studies, similar numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were found in healthy and infected dogs, showing no correlation with clinical status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, which it may be indicative of the large individual variability among the dogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This reduction in cellularity was also evidenced by the reduced numbers of cells isolated from the spleen in dogs in the DH group and by the detection of periarteriolar lymphatic sheath and lymphoid follicle atrophy. T lymphocytes were few in number or absent from the white pulp and could be found in red pulp, which represents most of the remaining tissue. However, the number of B lymphocytes and plasma cells increased and accumulated in this area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, which may contribute to the total number of apoptotic cells in the DL and DH groups. Finally, we also detected CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells expressing both TIM-3 and CTLA-4 exhaustion receptors. However, no significant differences were found among the groups. When analysing naturally infected dogs, a high degree of variability is inevitable, which can influence the results. However, the DL group presented the highest CD4<sup>+</sup>CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> counts, similar to that observed for the CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> cell count in the red pulp by immunohistochemistry.</p><p id="Par21">Interestingly, despite lower quantities of T lymphocytes, as measured by periarteriolar lymphatic sheath atrophy and the detection of apoptotic cells, we observed that the expression of TIM-3 was high in all groups. We hypothesized that exhaustion receptors are expressed on cells other than T lymphocytes—possibly B lymphocytes, as B lymphocytes represent a frequently observed subpopulation in the spleen. To answer this question, we identified CD21<sup>+</sup>TIM3<sup>+</sup> B cells in the spleen of infected dogs, suggesting that the cellular exhaustion process may also occur in B cells during the parasitism of dogs by <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>. Studies examining exhausted B lymphocytes expressing TIM-4<sup>+</sup> have already been performed in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, but the role of TIM-3 in leishmaniasis has not yet been clarified. In dogs infected by <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>, the association of SWP microarchitecture disruption with the accumulation of plasma cells in the spleen has been demonstrated. In addition, dogs with active infection and disorganization of the white pulp present more severe dysproteinaemia and an increased serum globulin fraction, which also correlates with the intensity of the accumulation of plasma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, IgG-producing cells are predominantly responsible for the increase in plasma cell density in the spleen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In addition, the expression levels of CXCL12, APRIL and BAFF, molecules associated with the localization and survival of plasma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, are elevated in the splenic tissue of animals with active infection and disorganization of the SWP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that polyclonal activation of B cells contributed to diminished apoptotic cells in DH dogs. Plasmacytosis in secondary lymphoid organs has been proposed to be primarily responsible for the hypergammaglobulinaemia associated with chronic inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Moreover, splenic plasmacytosis has been reported to be strongly associated with high serum globulin concentrations, a relative increase in the serum gamma globulin fraction and serum dysproteinaemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Serum protein electrophoresis has revealed that the hypergammaglobulinemia presented by animals with infection and the disorganization of the SWP are clearly distributed polyclonally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The role of PD-L1 in B cell function and experimentally induced chronic inflammatory responses in dogs has been demonstrated, and the presence of a novel and critical molecule for B cell regulation, the B10 regulator, has been shown to induce the expression of IgD during progressive VL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Cells expressing B10 produce IL-10, which induces other B cells and T cells to produce IL-10 and suppresses IFN-γ through PD-L1/PD1. PD-L1<sup>+</sup> cell types were not characterized in the present study, although PD-L1 gene expression was detected. Despite these published data, the role of exhausted B cells in the immunopathogenesis of VL requires further clarification.</p><p id="Par22">Splenic disorganization caused by <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> infection and/or coinfections appears as rupture of the splenic microarchitecture, hindering the activation of lymphocytes and the immune response against antigens and thereby suppressing the immune response against <italic>Leishmania</italic> and other pathogens. Our data support the hypothesis that the alteration of the extracellular matrix of the spleen is related to the cellular exhaustion process and, consequently, to immunosuppression. This hypothesis may explain the development of clinical signs and the failure to control the parasite load in animals with SWP disorganization. We observed that most of the dogs presented disorganization of the microarchitecture of the SWP (N = 30, 73.2%). Additionally, we observed reductions in the size and number of lymphoid follicles, the number of cells in the periarteriolar lymphatic sheath, and the quantity of CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes in the red pulp. These results indicate that T and B lymphocytes may not migrate to their specific sites and/or are dying by apoptosis. According to the present data and the data reported by other authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, the association between a high percentage of T cell apoptosis and structural disorganization of the SWP contributes to the inefficient cell-mediated immune response in dogs infected by <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>.

Ultimately, we demonstrated associations among cellular exhaustion, apoptosis, splenic disorganization, reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte numbers, failure to control the parasite load and the worsening of disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par24">The animals included in this study were dogs naturally infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> that were destined for euthanasia, as recommended by the policies of the Brazilian Ministry of Health.

Spleen sections with a thickness of 5 μm were fixed with acetone P.A. (Merck) on silanized slides (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Then, the sections were hydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 minutes, followed by inhibition of endogenous peroxidase with a solution containing 3% hydrogen peroxide (Dako) for 1 minute at room temperature. The sections were washed twice in PBS for 5 minutes each time. For the inhibition of non-specific binding, the sections were incubated in a solution containing 0.4% BSA for 20 minutes at room temperature. The excess blocking solution was discarded, and primary antibodies for CD4<sup>+</sup> (YKIX302.9), CD8<sup>+</sup> (YCATE55.9), CD21<sup>+</sup> (CA2.1D6) (Bio-Rad AbD Serotec, Hercules, USA), the cytokines IFN-γ (CC302) and IL-10 (CC318) (Bio-Rad AbD Serotec), the proliferation marker Ki-67 (SolA15) (eBioscience, San Diego, USA), and the exhaustion markers PD-1 (NAT105), LAG-3 (11E3), CTLA-4 (BNI3) and TIM-3 (polyclonal) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were added for 18 hours at 4 °C. Control of the reaction was accomplished by suppressing the primary antibody in at least one of the tissue sections. The slides were subsequently washed with PBS twice for 5 minutes each and then incubated with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (Dako) for 25 minutes, followed by another 2 washes with PBS. The sections were incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase (Genetex) for 25 minutes. After another 2 washes with PBS, the antigen-antibody reaction was detected with an AEC kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). After visualization of the optical microscopy marking, the reaction was stopped with type II water, and the sections were counterstained with Meyer’s haematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA), followed by assembly in Faramount medium (Dako). Five slides per animal were evaluated under an optical microscope, and the levels of the lymphocyte markers CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and CD21<sup>+</sup>; cytokines; the proliferation marker Ki-67; and exhaustion markers were quantified in the splenic red pulp in alternating fields under 40x magnification.
