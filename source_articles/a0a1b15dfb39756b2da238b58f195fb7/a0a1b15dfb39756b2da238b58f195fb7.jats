An example of this occurs in the predatory bacterium <italic>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</italic>, which cycles between free-living and intraperiplasmic phases after entering (and killing) another bacterium. The initiation of prey invasion is governed by DgcB (GGDEF enzyme) that produces cyclic-di-GMP in response to an unknown stimulus. Here, we report the structure of DgcB, and demonstrate that the GGDEF and sensory forkhead-associated (FHA) domains form an asymmetric dimer. Our structures indicate that the FHA domain is a consensus phosphopeptide sensor, and that the ligand for activation is surprisingly derived from the N-terminal region of DgcB itself. We confirm this hypothesis by determining the structure of a FHA:phosphopeptide complex, from which we design a constitutively-active mutant (confirmed via enzyme assays). Our results provide an understanding of the stimulus driving DgcB-mediated prey invasion and detail a unique mechanism of GGDEF enzyme regulation.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">The initiation of prey invasion by the predatory bacterium <italic>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</italic> is governed by the activity of the diguanlylate cyclase DgcB.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The switch between distinct lifestyle states in bacteria (e.g. motile to sessile, biofilm to planktonic) is often co-ordinated by the ubiquitous second messenger cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therein, sensory subdomains (commonly receptors for small molecules, or domains gated by protein:protein interaction) control the activity of c-di-GMP production and degradation by appending these to GGDEF and EAL/HD-GYP enzymatic domains, respectively—all three enzymes named after active site motifs. Free c-di-GMP is sensed by a variety of recognition modules, e.g., PilZ domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, riboswitches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, non-catalytic GGDEF/EAL variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and coupled to downstream outputs that effect the lifestyle switching. Different lifestyles require varying pathway complexity—one such bacterium with a high c-di-GMP “intelligence” is the bacterial predator <italic>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</italic>, encoding 5 GGDEF synthases (one degenerate), 1 EAL and 6 HD-GYP hydrolases (4 degenerate), and &gt;18 PilZ receptors in the model strain HD100 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>). This network complexity may run to even greater depths, with an additional 65 putative novel receptors identified using c-di-GMP resin affinity methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This need for multiple, diverse signaling pathways is presumably related to the diverse environments encountered during the <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> lifecycle.</p><p id="Par4"><italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> is an obligate bacterial predator of other Gram-negative bacteria, exploiting adaptations that allow consumption from inside the prey cell periplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Access to this “private dining niche” is afforded by a staged invasion process requiring (i) a free-living phase where the predator swims and/or glides to locate prey; (ii) an initially reversible attachment event that proceeds to a tight junction between both cells; (iii) whole-cell outer-membrane invasion, in which the predator pulls itself into the prey periplasm using a type IV pilus; and (iv) resealing of the invasion pore. The invaded cell is stabilized and modified to become what is referred to as the bdelloplast, prior to metabolism and assimilation of prey macromolecules by <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic>. The filamentous predator then grows and septates, releasing progeny via lysis of the host cell. Landmark studies revealed discrete phenotypes for <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> GGDEF gene knockouts, and that each GGDEF could not compensate for loss of another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The four GGDEFs shown to be active (linking two molecules of GTP to give the c-di-GMP product) were given the prefix Dgc (<underline>D</underline>i<underline>g</underline>uanylate <underline>c</underline>yclases) A-D, and the remaining degenerate variant GGDEF was found to be a receptor (CdgA). The varied phenotypes tallied with lifecycle events, with loss of DgcA preventing exit from the exhausted prey shell, and loss of CdgA resulting in slower invasion than wild-type cells. Intriguingly, loss of DgcB and DgcC gave rise to opposing effects—the ΔDgcB predator unable to commit to prey invasion (resulting in obligate axenic growth), and the ΔDgcC predator unable to convert to a form able to grow outside prey (host-independent stage, licensed in the lab via mutation). ΔDgcD cells had no gross observable deficit and require further investigation to ascertain any functional importance. Hence, it was hypothesized that lack of natural complementation between Dgc knockouts resulted from either local circuits of c-di-GMP (resulting in a signal not freely diffusible) or a requirement for the Dgc proteins to be physically present at a cellular site. An example of such a system has been observed in other bacteria, e.g. <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, where c-di-GMP has been shown to bind to an inhibitory (I-site, RxxD motif) region of the GGDEF fold, turning the resulting protein:nucleotide complex into a unique signaling agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Control of initiation of the <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> predation lifecycle may thus involve the opposing effects of DgcB and DgcC, with invasion gated by prey-contact/encounter-stimulated activation of DgcB. Activated DgcB would then signal to CdgA, amongst other targets. The ability to invade and kill prey (as monitored by plaque formation on prey lawns) was demonstrated to be dependent on active DgcB, given that the knockout could not be complemented by a GGAAF non-catalytic variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The <italic>dgcB</italic> gene, <italic>bd0742</italic>, has orthologues in other <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> strains and also distantly related myxococccal predators (that kill prey by an entirely different “Wolfpack” mechanism)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The DgcB protein appends the C-terminal GGDEF enzymatic domain with an N-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, known to be used (in other proteins) for interactions with phosphopeptide ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The novel domain architecture of DgcB is interesting—were the activity of DgcB to be dependent on classical FHA function/principles, invasion could potentially involve a sensory kinase that would respond to prey encounter by phosphorylating a protein ligand which would then bind DgcB at the FHA domain to regulate GGDEF activity and thus c-di-GMP production. We reasoned that a structure of DgcB would inform on whether the predicted N-terminal FHA domain was a bone-fide signaling domain with a consensus binding cleft, and whether its juxtaposition to the GGDEF domain was likely to render it inhibitory or stimulatory.</p><p id="Par6">To determine the precise mechanism behind DgcB activation, with the aim of understanding the events that license switching of <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> into an invasion-competent diguanylate cyclase-active state, we determined the structure of DgcB. Our structure reveals a stimulatory role for the N-terminal tail of DgcB and we show that the DgcB FHA domain recognizes this tail in its phosphorylated state. In addition, we confirm this mechanism of activation by the use of disulfide mutagenesis to lock DgcB in an obligate-activated state.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>DgcB structure determination</title><p id="Par7">An initial full-length construct yielded a 1.79 Å crystal structure (statistics for all structures are provided in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), composed of two copies in the asymmetric unit. This structure was solved via molecular replacement using isolated domains from GGDEF and FHA proteins, allowing the majority of the polypeptide chain to be resolved (aa 32–134 and 144–310). DgcB comprised a ~30aa tail, 100aa FHA, 20aa linker and 160aa GGDEF domain. Distance constraints guided the assignment of FHA domains to their respective GGDEF partners, revealing a unique conformation for each chain. This arrangement is best described as a pseudosymmetrical GGDEF dimer, appended to two FHA domains that are asymmetrically orientated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>); the net effect is to place the FHA domains closer to GGDEF chain B. The dimer is stabilized by two molecules of c-di-GMP (classically intercalating via their planar bases), bound at the I-site of both monomers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). The bound c-di-GMP arises from co-purification, as a result of (basally) active DgcB. The resulting (FHA:GGDEF:c-di-GMP)<sub>2</sub> DgcB complex has approximate dimensions of 70 × 70 × 40 Å. The overall DgcB architecture and topology is unique among determined structures but the individual domains are in good agreement with characterized domains from other proteins.

FHA domains are usually compact, recognizing a linear phosphopeptide substrate in their binding partner, e.g. the FHA domain of Rad53p forms a complex with a phosphopeptide from Rad9p, and is used to regulate the cell cycle of yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The FHA domain of DgcB is relatively small in size (with no significant insertions into the loops between strands), resulting in a very compact subdomain with “flat” faces. Consistent with assignment to the FHA superfamily, the DgcB sequence contains the consensus residues that comprise the ligand-binding cleft, using S75, R76 and T96 at the apical face of the FHA domain to create a classical phosphopeptide recognition pocket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The floor of this pocket is stabilized by the buried H78 sidechain. Examination of the pocket reveals that the putative phosphate site is occupied by a bound ion in chain B, and that of chain A is partially occluded by residue D56 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The D56 interaction between one FHA domain and another sits at the centre of an interface that buries 582.4 Å<sup>2</sup> surface area. The FHA:FHA interface is composed of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, packing the phosphopeptide binding surface/loops of chain A against one face of the chain B β-sandwich. The vast majority of contacts to the GGDEF dimer are made by the chain A FHA domain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>); these comprises both polar (D70 and K48 to chain B) and non-polar (I40 and I126 to chain A, Y45 and Y68 to chain B) interactions. A putative N-terminal tail preceding the FHA domain (residues 1–31) is present on our construct but presumed disordered in this structure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Features of linker region and enzymatic GGDEF domain</title><p id="Par9">The interdomain region (residues 135–143 inclusive) is not discernable for either chain in the electron density map, needing to span a distance of 14/19 Å for chains A/B, respectively. The remaining linker polypeptide is in differing conformations between the two monomers: chain A has a small helical region in the linker (146–154, displaying density for the mainchain but weak density for sidechains), and chain B has an extended conformation that starts the first GGDEF helix (α0, 157–172) one turn earlier than chain A. The chain B arrangement is more comparable to other determined GGDEF structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, wherein the preceding conserved DxLT motif (150–153) involved in enzyme activation is present in a tight turn (in chain A this has a differing structure and is part of the small helix).

Additional contacts to the c-di-GMP are made from residues T242, V246 and R249 on the face of an α-helix. The sidechain of R249 stacks with the guanine base, hydrogen bonding to the O and N7 of the opposing c-di-GMP guanine and the carbonyl of L216. This interaction appears to stabilize a helical turn that precedes the RxxD motif into a <italic>π</italic> (I +5) conformation, and allow the carbonyl of K215 to hydrogen bond to the c-di-GMP 2′-OH. The interactions of DgcB with the c-di-GMP ligand provide the major contact between the two GGDEF domains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>); direct protein:protein contacts are limited to just one weak interaction involving the partially ordered linker region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>A FHA-only structure suggests a self-stimulatory peptide</title><p id="Par11">Our “full-length” structure of DgcB did not reveal the conformation of the N-terminal tail (residues 1–31), possibly as a result of being locked in a c-di-GMP-inhibited state.

In this new form, four FHA domains comprise the asymmetric unit, with each monomer arranged at ~90˚ to the neighboring domain. Upon imposing crystal symmetry, it is apparent that each monomer contacts a symmetry-related molecule in precisely the same manner as chains A and B of the full-length DgcB structure (mediated through D56, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, also Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).

Our high resolution data allowed us to unambiguously model this density as residues K13-S19 of the previously disordered N-terminal tail of DgcB. It was not possible to assign the tail as originating from a specific chain (chain B, C and D FHA domains are all close enough to span the distance to the bound tail). In agreement with assignment of the FHA domain as a putative phosphothreonine receptor, the interactions between the tail and FHA cleft centre around residue T14, which is conserved in homologues of DgcB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The FHA cleft makes three hydrogen bonds to the tail (involving R61, T96 and N97), which binds in a linear conformation across the apical face of the FHA fold (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref>). Prior to this study, any potential stimulus peptide substrate for DgcB was unknown—our observation that the FHA of DgcB could recognize a self peptide led us to investigate sequence features and conservation at this region of the protein. Aligning the N-terminal tail from a representative group of DgcB homologues reveals a pattern of conservation across a seven residue span (−3 to +3 with respect to the central threonine); our structure underlines the importance of the +3 position (V17), which points downward into the cleft and is a crucial recognition feature of the peptide substrate in other FHA-based sensory systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">The highest-confidence matches (via DALI) of the DgcB FHA are GarA and OdhI, which also utilize a self-peptide recognition mode for signaling purposes (using steric occlusion to regulate interaction with other proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>). Comparison of the tail region between DgcB and homologues suggests that similar features are recognized between the two differing systems: hydrophobic residues at the −3, +2 and +3 positions, glutamate (DgcB E12) at −2 and serine (S15) at +1. Upon structural superimposition of DgcB and OdhI via the FHA β-sandwich, it is apparent that the phosphopeptide of the OdhI tail sits in a slightly different position to the unphosphorylated tail of DgcB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). In total, our structures and the sequence conservation of the DgcB tail suggest that this region is likely to be the true ligand for the FHA domain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>A phosphopeptide complex validates the DgcB:tail interaction</title><p id="Par14">We sought to validate the in-cis FHA:tail interaction (a “basal” unphosphorylated state) via obtaining a structure of the (likely more relevant) phosphopeptide complex. By combining a tailless DgcB FHA construct (residues 32–131, V32 replaced with an initiating methionine) and synthetic phosphopeptide (N<sup>7</sup>SDNLEKpTSIVASDT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>) in-trans, we were able to obtain complex crystals diffracting to 1.48 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit of this new form contained two FHA domains that were in an offset dimer identical to both the full-length and FHA-only structures, providing a third independent observation of this interaction. The exposed FHA cleft of chain B displays clear density for a bound phosphopeptide, allowing unequivocal modeling of residues 11–21 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref>). The conformation of the bound tail region does not differ substantially from that of the unphosphorylated complex (rmsd 1.0 Å for all atoms), but sits relatively deeper into the FHA cleft, making more extensive contacts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The more deeply situated tail is now able to form mainchain hydrogen bonds with R61, K72 and N97 (via both groups of the amide sidechain). The extended conformation of the tail (~30 Å across) results in the sidechains of E12, K13, I16 and S19 facing away from the FHA domain. The FHA surface creates two depressions which accommodate the two “inwardly projected” residues of the tail (pT14 and +3 V17, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>); the flanking L11 and T21 sidechains sandwich opposing sides of the central FHA body. The C-terminal end of the tail packs against the preceding residues, with the sidechain of T21 making a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of A18. The central pT14 of the peptide tail is recognized by a multitude of interactions, the sidechain methyl group projecting into a pocket formed by residues 72–75 and 96–97, which positions the phosphate toward the positively charged R61 and R76 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The phosphoryl group is tightly co-ordinated by the FHA cleft of DgcB: OG by R61, O1 by S95 and T96, O2 by both the backbone NH and sidechain of R76, and O3 by R76 (and the backbone NH of pT14 also). Comparison of the peptide-bound and unbound FHA domain structures reveals that peptide binding does not induce any obvious gross conformational change or long-range signaling motions, merely alterations in the rotameric states of R61, K72 and R76 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). These alterations do not seemingly propagate any further change in the molecule distant from the recognition cleft (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structure of liganded DgcB phosphopeptide complex (FHA domain and exogenous synthetic DgcB phosphopeptide derived from N-terminal tail sequence). <bold>a</bold> Surface representation demonstrating shape complementarity between FHA binding cleft (near side colored pink, far side purple, body of FHA fold white) and phosphopeptide (residues 11–20, yellow/transparent). <bold>b</bold> Charge representation of the peptide-binding cleft (coulombic surface coloring, −10 to +10 kcal/(mol·e), red to blue), with residues R61, K72 and R76 converging at the pThr residue.

To test this hypothesis, in the context of not having identified the <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> kinase that could specifically phosphorylate the tail, we aimed to use our structure to design a mutant with an enhanced propensity to adopt the tail-bound conformation. Initially we attempted a phosphomimetic mutant: activity assays with a T14D-R218A variant (the latter substitution preventing feedback inhibition at the I site) gave only a very small increase in diguanylate cyclase activity c.f. wild-type protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), in agreement with the general literature view that acidic substitutions are not good analogues of phosphothreonine. We therefore sought to identify residues that would tolerate disulphide linkage between the tail and body of the FHA domain (one cysteine substitution on each, adjacent to one another), giving a covalent “trapping” under oxidizing conditions. Initial analyses with Disulfide-by-design software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> were negative but manual inspection of the structure revealed a region of the fold that could be amenable to modification if given a simple rotameric alteration from its observed conformation. The S15 residue immediately after pT14 faces toward a loop present on the FHA β-sandwich that contains S73 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In all three of our DgcB structures, the OG of S73 hydrogen bonds to the backbone NH of N124 and sidechain of D71; but manual alteration to a different rotamer would position it towards S15 of the tail. The resulting 2.9 Å distance is longer than the S:S distance in a disulfide, but an S to C substitution at both partners would be isosteric and able to partially flex/move to shorten this gap.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Design, validation and regulation of a disulphide-activated DgcB mutant. <bold>a</bold> Design of the disulfide mutation to lock DgcB into a constitutively active state.

The R218A mutation at the I-site was engineered into constructs to relieve auto-inhibition and maximize c-di-GMP detection, and a negative control provided via GGDEF catalytic site mutation (E229A, E230A). A basal signal of c-di-GMP was observed in the wild-type enzyme, as a result of co-purification with c-di-GMP (as demonstrated in our full-length structure). Analyses of mutant proteins combining these variations revealed strong activity for only the S15C-S73C-R218A enzyme (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–h</xref>), the reaction going to completion ~45 s after GTP addition (at 10 µM protein). In contrast, a single cysteine mutant (S15C-R218A—used to control for the potential effect of cys bringing GGDEFs together in non-specific fashion) displayed no significant activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d, f</xref>). We conclude that the above design procedure is valid, and that activation is a specific consequence of FHA cleft occupancy, with the mutant acting as a proxy for phosphorylation. The observation of strong activity for our “disulphide-stapled” mutant led us to investigate whether we could specifically reverse this effect via TCEP-mediated reduction. The CD spectrum shows that post reduction, the double cysteine mutant is still folded (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>), and c-di-GMP production is not detectable even at 10 µM protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate inducible control of DgcB activity, and further validate our peptide complex structures. Other control experiments confirm that the I-site is not masking wild-type activity (the single R218A mutant is not active), and that removal of the FHA domain is not sufficient to activate DgcB (the GGDEF-only construct purifies with a small amount of c-di-GMP at the I-site, but does not display significant activity, as ascertained by analysis of the GGDEF-only R218A protein).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Relation of DgcB oligomeric state to activity</title><p id="Par17">Stimulated by the observation that DgcB S15C-S73C-R218A licensed cyclic-di-GMP production, we next sought to understand the relationship between DgcB oligomerisation and activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Initial size-exclusion chromatography confirmed our structural observation that cyclic-di-GMP holds DgcB in a dimeric state, which converts to a monomer with the R218A substitution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In a separate control, the S15C-S73C-R218A variant remains monomeric under reducing conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), but converts to a more complex ensemble when oxidized, which we assigned to five major fractions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Calibration to known standards, and validation by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>), indicate these sizes to be aggregate (peak 1), higher-order oligomer (peak 2), tetramer (peak 3), dimer (peak 4) and monomer (peak 5). The denaturing, non-reducing conditions of the SDS-PAGE indicate that the dimer is almost exclusively disulphide-linked between chains (tail to FHA of opposing subunits) rather than within chains. Assuming that the individual peaks don’t interconvert, we assayed these separate fractions for activity, inclusive of controls for total oxidized (all size fractions included) and total reduced protein. Intriguingly, differently sized-oligomers of DgcB all displayed differing activity profiles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). The reduced and oxidized controls confirmed the earlier finding that the DgcB S15C-S73C-R218A variant could be activated via oxidation. As expected, the non-specific aggregate fraction displayed the least activity of the oxidized samples (peak 1). The dimer (peak 4) was the most active state, displaying faster consumption of GTP than the total oxidized protein (mixed, all oligomers).

The full-length form of DgcB is informative of regulation, providing information on several domain interfaces (FHA:FHA, FHA:GGDEF and GGDEF:GGDEF). The conformation we observe likely represents a feedback-inhibited state wherein the GGDEF domain has been locked by the c-di-GMP product into a non-productive conformation; we posit that this represents a form present after entry of prey. This state is further stabilized/inhibited by protein:protein interactions—the FHA domains making contacts to one another, and also the GGDEF domains (in particular chain A situated between the two α0 helices). DgcB binds c-di-GMP using both I-sites of the GGDEF dimer, forming a pseudosymmetric protein:nucleotide complex. This mode of inhibition is distinct from most well-characterized GGDEF proteins, which usually complex c-di-GMP via a single I-site in conjuction with another region of the fold (e.g. the REC domain of PleD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>). To the best of our knowledge, this two-fold arrangement has only been observed in the Dcsbis GGDEF from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> where the enzymatic domain is appended to a differing GAF sensory domain. This observation is related to the asymmetric orientation of the stimulus-sensing FHA domains, i.e., a symmetric GGDEF dimer centred around the I-site constricts the space available at the N-terminal end of the fold. Hence, most GGDEF proteins do not adopt this orientation as it would lead to steric clashes of the appended sensory domains, but in DgcB this conformation is enabled by having the chain B FHA domain offset. Supportive of this idea is the finding that the I-site symmetrical dimer of Dcsbis was obtained from a truncated construct (lacking the sensory GAF domain), and that the full-length protein adopts a different conformation.</p><p id="Par19">FHA asymmetric intercalation into the GGDEF dimer appears to be relevant because the hydrophobic residues involved are conserved in DgcB homologues, and both the FHA:FHA and GGDEF:GGDEF orientations compatible with this arrangement have been observed independently in multiple structures (FHA the three separate forms of this study, GGDEF homologues in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>).

Like other GGDEFs, I-site inhibition of DgcB is dominant over the active state, as shown by our activity assays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Physiologically, this mechanism exists to set an upper limit for local [c-di-GMP] at the prey-interacting pole of the <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> cell, which from DgcB production would persist over a very specific (relatively short) timeframe during prey invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">The orientation of the GGDEF domains in an active enzyme is presumed to be 180˚ from that of the I-site inhibited form—this productive state would allow the GG(D/E)EF motifs (of a different dimeric arrangement) to approach one another, leading to two molecules of GTP positioned correctly to form the cyclic product. It is important to consider the DgcB structure in the context of general features of GGDEF activation - almost without exception, GGDEF proteins with differing stimulus-sensing/input domains (Rec, PAS, GAF, HAMP, transmembrane, usually N-terminal to the enzymatic domain) use a helical coiled-coil (α-1) to communicate the regulatory signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. When comparing five well-characterized GGDEFs, this region demonstrates relative flexation, leading to a generalized model that uses the tilt angle between α-1 and the catalytic domain to modulate the frequency of GGDEF:GGDEF encounter and thus c-di-GMP formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The tilt/communication may be regulated by two continuous features – a heptad repeat region of the coiled coil, and a consensus DxLTxxxN/SR/K motif that forms a wide β-turn that leads into the GGDEF fold. The differing conformation of the D<sup>150</sup>xLTxxxSK<sup>158</sup> regions in DgcB is of interest—chain B places this motif in the consensus β-turn conformation found in the majority of GGDEF structures. In contrast, the DxLT component of chain A forms part of a helix in the interdomain linker, unwinding the region afterward such that S157 projects toward D221 of the I-site RxxD motif. There is no suggestion that this unusual conformation of the chain A DxLT motif is mechanistically relevant—the small helix (aa 147–154) would be peripherally located/isolated in a GGDEF dimer where the active sites were productively engaged. However, the plastic nature of this region in general is of interest given the aforementioned tilt model of activation and requirement for multiple conformations; our structures suggest that the arrangement of the DxLT motif can alter into a stable form, rather than an order/disorder transition.</p><p id="Par21">A substrate complex representative of a competent catalytic state has yet to be obtained for a GGDEF enzyme, the closest matches being a post-catalysis form of YdeH/DgcZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> (with c-di-GMP product spanning two active sites), a complex of <italic>Is</italic>PadC (GTP locking the monomers together rather than juxtaposing active sites)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and an active/empty <italic>Is</italic>PadC heterodimer with quasi-translated coiled coils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. GGDEF activation can be triggered by stimulus-induced dimerization (e.g. PleD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>) and/or stimulus-induced domain rearrangement (often relieving self-inhibitory interactions, e.g. DosC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>). The observation of the DgcB FHA sensory domain in a common dimeric conformation across our three separate structure determinations suggests that this complex is stable (as a constitutive dimer, even in the absence of the GGDEF domain), and would need at least partial rearrangement to place the GGDEF domains into an active conformation.</p><p id="Par22">The orientation of the DgcB FHA domains in a form lacking c-di-GMP inhibition remains enigmatic, and we were unsuccessful despite extensive trials with a R218A mutant; if the FHA domains kept the same interaction as the three structures presented herein, one FHA phosphopeptide cleft would be exposed and the other sequestered (via R61 of the “closed” monomer binding to E64 of the “open” monomer, and D56 inserting into the “closed” site near to where the phosphothreonine binds). Our structure of the FHA:phosphopeptide complex demonstrates that cleft occupancy does not alter the FHA:FHA contacts, at least for a peptide added in trans. Hence, rearrangement will presumably require cis phosphopeptide binding, wherein the two elements that flank the pThr epitope (aa 1–10, 22–31) can alter the surface properties of the FHA domain and change the domain:domain packing; tail-binding could promote new interactions (e.g. in the inter-domain linker region) and/or relieve inhibitory interactions (e.g. our observed FHA:GGDEF interface). Our observation that both the unphosphorylated tail (intrinsic) and phosphorylated form (extrinsic) can bind the DgcB FHA domain is in keeping with other (non-GGDEF) FHA proteins, e.g. GarA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and the mode of peptide binding is similar despite the pronounced differences in FHA sequence and functional usage. Our activity assays demonstrate that this “non-specific” binding does not appear to result in any significant c-di-GMP production (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, e</xref>), presumably providing tight control on the process of prey invasion. We can conclude that the I-site c-di-GMP is self-produced, because the E229-E230 variant does not co-purify with nucleotide (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>); so the small amount of wild-type basal activity is enough to eventually saturate the protein over the longer timescale of recombinant production.</p><p id="Par23">From careful searching of the literature, we are not aware of any other covalently-locked FHA variants; this methodology may thus be of interest as a tool to study other signaling systems. The vastly increased c-di-GMP production of the S15C-S73C-R218A mutant of DgcB can be interpreted (as intended from design guided by the phosphopeptide complex) as a locked active form that has lost I-site inhibition. Historically, it has been easier to design obligate “off” GGDEF proteins versus obligate “on” variants, with a notable exception being a GCN4 zipper:GGDEF fusion protein with high activity that dimerizes around an introduced strong coiled-coil forming segment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The differences between wild-type DgcB (no appreciable activity), T14D-R218A (phosphomimetic, minor c-di-GMP production) and S15C-S73C-R218A (presumed locked tail, strong activity) are very suggestive of DgcB activation via FHA tail phosphorylation. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the ability to reverse the activation of the S15C-S73C-R218A form using TCEP to reduce the disulfide between the tail and FHA domain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">There are several potential modes in which tail-driven reorganization of the observed asymmetric FHA:FHA interface could occur, all of which have been observed to operate for different FHA-containing proteins: formation of intradomain contacts (tail binding self, akin to GarA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, OdhI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>) or interdomain contacts (tail binding oligomeric partner, head-to-head, head-to-tail, or as a fibre akin to TIFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>). Head-to-tail and fibre models would require an active form larger than a dimer to place the GGDEF domains together. Our dissection of the differing activities for different oligomeric states of DgcB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) suggest that although monomers, tetramers and higher-order oligomers all demonstrate some activity, the most-highly active species was the dimeric form. We are able to combine intra- and head-to-head inter-domain models with both our observed structures and general principles for GGDEF activation into a working model for the DgcB active state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). There is some evidence from our reducing SDS-PAGE that the inter- linked conformation (tail into opposing monomer) may be more prevelant in the active dimers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Herein we have used constraints from a dimeric pseudoactive <italic>Is</italic>PadC structure (5LLW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>) to position two copies of chain B from full-length DgcB. The resultant orientation is sterically compatible with both FHA domains and bound phosphopeptide tails (superimposed), leaving the linker peptide appropriately positioned to span the region occupied by the <italic>Is</italic>PadC coiled coil. Adoption of this state would require both the linker (aa 135–143) and start of wide turn (aa 144–148) to adopt a helical conformation (~2 heptad repeats), which is interesting given our observation of a small helix preceding the turn in chain A of the full-length DgcB. The distances involved are similar for either intra- or inter- FHA:tail interactions. For the purposes of tail-binding driving conversion into the active state, this model suggests that the two flanking regions (either side of the tail) could assist by orienting away from the coiled coil space (aa 22–31) and possibly contacting the GGDEF domains (aa 1–10). Tail-binding would also occupy the FHA cleft, relieving the FHA:FHA contacts observed in all three of the structures presented here. Further, our model uses a 1:1 stoichiometry of tail:FHA, as we believe the 1:2 ratio of our phosphopeptide complex structure to be related to crystallization conditions. Lastly, the FHA:GGDEF contacts observed in our full-length structure are incompatible with an occupied FHA cleft, suggesting that part of DgcB activation could result from GGDEF “release” from this state and associated increase in conformational freedom.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Proposed model for DgcB activation. <bold>a</bold> Inset, DgcB representation as oriented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

This rearrangement results in productive association of the GGDEF active sites (dark green) and synthesis of c-di-GMP. The resultant c-di-GMP signals downstream invasion processes until an upper threshold is achieved and DgcB subsequently inhibited via I-site mediated feedback (I-site, orange block; as observed in our full-length structure).

The kinase responsible for phosphorylating DgcB T14 has not been identified (and this is beyond the scope of this study), but presumably senses prey encounter and has multiple protein substrates. Our working hypothesis is that the kinase would sense a stimulus upon prey encounter (Myxococci sense osmolarity changes when exposed to prey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>), and become active, phosphorylating T14 of DgcB to stimulate conformational change into a state capable of producing cyclic-di-GMP. Supporting this hypothesis, the distantly related predator <italic>Sorangium cellulosum</italic> encodes for a putative 974aa fused kinase-tail-FHA-GGDEF protein (UniProt BE21_29150), whose kinase domain is most similar to <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> gene product Bd3148 (26% identity; interestingly this also shares 27% identity with the PknG kinase that phosphorylates the OdhI FHA tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>).
