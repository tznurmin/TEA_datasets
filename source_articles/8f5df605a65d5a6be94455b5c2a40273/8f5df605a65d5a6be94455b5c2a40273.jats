Here, we report the identification and characterization of ETF α and β subunit encoding genes (<italic>ETFA</italic> and <italic>ETFB</italic>) and ETFDH encoding gene (<italic>ETFDH</italic>) in the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. It was demonstrated that, by impacting fatty acid metabolism, ETF and ETFDH mutations led to severe growth and conidiation defects, which could be largely rescued by exogenous acetate or carbonate. Furthermore, although conidium germination and appressorium formation appeared to be normal in ETF and ETFDH mutants, most appressoria failed to penetrate the host epidermis due to low turgor pressure. The few appressoria that succeeded in penetration were severely restricted in invasive growth and consequently failed to cause disease. Moreover, ETF mutant <italic>etfb</italic><sup>−</sup> induced ROS accumulation in infected host cells and exogenous antioxidant GSH accelerated mutant invading growth without increasing the penetration rate. In addition, mutant <italic>etfb</italic><sup>−</sup> displayed elevated lipid body accumulation and reduced ATP synthesis. Taken together, ETF and ETFDH play an important role in fungal development and plant infection in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> by regulation of fatty acid metabolism, turgor establishment and induction

rice-planting areas worldwide and poses a severe threat to global food security, especially in the current changing climate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. <italic>M. oryzae</italic> has emerged as a model organism for the study of plant fungal pathogens and their interaction with hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. <italic>M. oryzae</italic> infection starts with a three-celled conidium contacting the host surface, which subsequently germinates and develops into a specialized structure called the appressorium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The appressorium matures by melanin-pigmentation and produces enormous turgor pressure by accumulating high concentrations of glycerol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The high pressure promotes the formation of a narrow penetration peg that elongates from the appressorium base and mechanically penetrates the host cuticle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Next, invasive hyphae (IH) develop from the penetration peg and propagate from one cell to another via plasmodesmata in susceptible hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. After colonization for 4–5 days, characteristic blast lesions appear on the host surface, where conidia are produced and spread to start a new infection cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p>The initial infection processes at the host surface from conidia adhesion to appressorial development do not require nutrient acquisition by the fungus, but does require the mobilization and metabolism of the storage reserves in conidia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. During this stage, lipid droplets move into incipient appressorium and coalesce into a central vacuole at the onset of turgor generation, which is under the control of the Pmk1 MAP kinase pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Along this line, rapid lipolysis catalyzed by triacylglycerol lipases release large amounts of glycerol in a process regulated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The glycerol concentration can reach a very high level over 3.0 M, which is believed to directly generate hydrostatic pressure by drawing water into the appressorium cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Simultaneously, the melanin layer is formed in the outer appressorium to prevent glycerol efflux and maintain the high turgor pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>In addition to glycerol, lipolysis also generates fatty acids that enter the β oxidation pathway for breakdown in either mitochondria or peroxisomes depending on the carbon chain length of the fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The short and medium-chain fatty acids with less than 20 carbons are mainly oxidized in mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, while long-chain fatty acids of over 20 carbons are first degraded into short-chain fatty acids in peroxisomes, which then move into mitochondria for complete oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The first dehydrogenation step of mitochondrial fatty acid β oxidation is catalyzed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Besides catalyzing dehydrogenation, acyl-CoA dehydrogenases also transfer electrons to an electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF), which, through an electron-transferring flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH), finally delivers the electrons to the ubiquinone pool in the terminal respiratory system for ATP synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, ETF and ETFDH link the fatty acids oxidation with respiratory system. To date, functional studies of ETF and ETFDH are well reported in humans, animals and yeasts. ETF consists of α- and β- subunits which contain a FAD cofactor and an AMP molecule respectively, while ETFDH is a monomer containing a FAD molecule and an iron–sulfur cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Inherited mutations of ETF and/or ETFDH can result in multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) and disrupt fatty acid β oxidation leading to a series of metabolic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Yeast ETF and ETFDH homologs Aim45, Cir1 and Cir2 were involved in cellular redox state under stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p>The roles of ETF and ETFDH are not well understood in filamentous fungi. In the current study, we first identify and functionally characterize two ETF genes (<italic>ETFA</italic> and <italic>ETFB</italic>) and one <italic>ETFDH</italic> gene in the rice blast fungus <italic>M. oryzae</italic> by targeted gene deletion and/or T-DNA insertion mutation.

Furthermore, the mutant mycelia did not cause disease symptoms on barley leaves (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).

Our results showed that, when growing on butyrate (C4), hexanoic (C6), octanoic (C8) or lauric (C12) as sole carbon source, the growth of ETF and ETFDH mutants was apparently inhibited in comparison to that of Guy11 (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). However, when growing on acetate (C2) and oleic (C18) as sole carbon source, ETF and ETFDH mutants displayed no growth difference from Guy11 (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>ETF and ETFDH were involved in fatty acids metabolism.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The growth of ETF and ETFDH mutants on MM with various fatty acids as sole carbon source after incubation for 10 days.

As weak-base salts, NaAC or Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> could counteract acids, so it can be concluded that the growth and conidiation defects of mutants were attributed to the fatty acids accumulation. Moreover, ETF and ETFDH mutants released an unpleasant smell like butyrate when growing on CM medium, while the smell is relatively weak on MM medium. To confirm this smell, butyrate was added to MM medium as sole carbon source to test its effect to fungal growth. As a result, the mutant growth and conidiation were obviously inhibited by butyrate as sole carbon source (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3a</xref> and S9a), which is similar to the effect when growing on CM medium. Furthermore, the conidial production of Guy11 was also obviously reduced when growing on butyrate as sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S9b</xref>).

As turgor pressure serves as direct force for penetration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, the reduced turgor in mutant <italic>etfb</italic><sup>−</sup> and their different penetration rate on different host surfaces further confirmed the importance of turgor to host penetration (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4</xref>b and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a).

This result also corresponded to the white pigmentation of mutant colonies growing on CM culture. Thus we conclude that the low penetration rate of ETF mutant <italic>etfb</italic><sup>−</sup> on host surface was due to a reduced appressorium turgor which was caused by the thin melanin layer.
