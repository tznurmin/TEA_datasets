Restricting gene therapeutics to the target cell type in many situations may be preferable compared to ubiquitous transgene expression, stimulating researchers to identify RGC-specific promoters, particularly promoter sequences that may also be appropriate in size to fit readily into recombinant adeno associated viral (AAV) vectors, the vector of choice for many ocular gene therapies. In the current study we analysed EGFP expression driven by various sequences of the putative human <italic>NEFH</italic> promoter in order to define sequences required for preferential expression in RGCs. EGFP expression profiles from four different potential <italic>NEFH</italic> promoter constructs were compared in vivo in mice using retinal histology and mRNA expression analysis. Notably, two efficient promoter sequences, one comprising just 199 bp, are presented in the study.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science

To date there are approximately 30 clinical trials for recombinant AAV therapies for ocular indications (clinicaltrials.gov). Restricting expression of a gene therapy to the target tissue or target cell type, in principle, should provide significant potential safety benefit, as well as possibly increasing the efficacy of the therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The use of well characterised AAV serotypes with specific cell tropisms, cell/tissue specific promoters as well as surgical procedures to deliver the therapy locally all represent ways of achieving this. For example, AAV2 is known to target retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) efficiently following intraocular injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">We previously demonstrated that a novel 2.2 kb murine Neurofilament heavy (<italic>Nefh</italic>) gene promoter preferentially and efficiently drove <italic>EGFP</italic> expression in RGCs and amacrine cells (ACs), compared to a ubiquitous <italic>CMV</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> when administered intravitreally in adult wild type mice using AAV2. Others too have investigated promoter sequences that express preferentially in RGCs. However, many promoter sequences of genes known to be RGC-specific, such as <italic>Brn3a</italic>, <italic>Thy1</italic> and <italic>Rbpms</italic>, are too large to be incorporated into AAV vectors, the vector of choice for many ocular gene therapies. AAV has a maximum cargo capacity of approximately 4.7 kb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. One study demonstrated that the <italic>DCX</italic> promoter (3310 bp; doublecortin) can drive strong and specific RGC expression following AAV-QuadYF-mediated delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, Simpson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> analysed various promoters with similar expression profiles and found the <italic>NEFL</italic> (2693 bp; neurofilament, light polypeptide) promoter to be the most specific to RGC in mice and NHPs. Following intravitreal (IV) delivery, high levels of gene expression from a 1 kb upstream sequence of the SNCG gene was shown to co-localise with Brn3A indicating preferential expression in RGCs. However this promoter was not further refined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Clearly, when treating a human condition, employing a human DNA sequence, rather than the murine <italic>Nefh</italic> promoter sequence, may be preferable in terms of utilising the human transcription and translation machinery. Thus in the current study we analysed upstream sequences of the human Neurofilament Heavy (<italic>NEFH</italic>) gene to establish regions that convey efficient tissue specificity. The focus was also on identifying a smaller ‘RGC promoter’ that as part of a gene therapy construct would readily fit within the 4.7 kb confines of the AAV packaging capacity. Since AAV2 is the vector of choice for targeting rodent RGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and in addition is known from Luxturna and various clinical trials to be well tolerated in the human eye (Ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, clinicaltrials.gov), this serotype was utilised in the current study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">Significant advances have been made in the development of gene therapies for ocular disease; indeed the first in vivo AAV gene therapy to receive market authorisation was Luxturna for RPE65-linked recessive inherited retinal degenerations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Clearly, using promoters that restrict transgene expression to the target cell or tissue type may represent advantages in terms of potential safety and efficacy in gene therapy approaches. Previous studies suggested that the murine <italic>Nefh</italic> mRNA is one of the most highly enriched transcripts in RGCs with an enrichment factor (EF) of 245-fold in the associated analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We established that a 2.2 kb murine <italic>Nefh</italic> promoter (<italic>Nefh-P</italic>) driving an <italic>EGFP</italic> gene, not only provided high levels of transgene expression in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) but also enabled highly preferential expression in RGCs with only a minimal number of ACs expressing the EGFP transgene. The objective of the current study was the characterisation and in vivo evaluation of a human <italic>NEFH</italic> promoter for potential use in AAV-mediated gene therapies. In the current study a 2.5 kb region of upstream sequence of the human <italic>NEFH</italic> gene was compared between 40 placental mammalian species using an in silico pipeline, which was developed specifically to isolate basewise conservation data from UCSC. Conservation data ranged from 0 to 1 for a given base, where 0 represents no significant conservation between mammals and 1 indicates complete conservation. Results of this analysis were plotted to visualise conserved regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A); the rational being that sequence conservation between mammalian species might indicate functionally important sequences. Employing this methodology, two highly conserved regions, termed Block F and Block A were identified. 2.5 kb of the <italic>NEFH</italic> upstream region, encompassing both Block F and Block A and the endogenous sequence in between were then cloned upstream of an <italic>EGFP</italic> cDNA (<italic>NEFH-P</italic>). Additionally, the Block F and Block A sequences were generated in a construct with a non-functional spacer sequence between the blocks and cloned upstream of the <italic>EGFP</italic> cDNA (<italic>hF-sp-hA-P</italic>). Notably this spacer sequence was designed to be the same length as the endogenous sequence. Blocks F and A were also engineered in one construct such that they were juxtaposed and upstream of the <italic>EGFP</italic> cDNA (<italic>hF</italic>-<italic>hA-P</italic>). Finally, Block A was cloned on its own upstream of the <italic>EGFP</italic> cDNA (<italic>hA-P</italic>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). High titre preparations of AAV2/2 expressing <italic>NEFH-P</italic>, <italic>hF</italic>-sp-<italic>hA-P</italic>, <italic>hF</italic>-<italic>hA-P</italic> and <italic>hA-P</italic> were generated and <italic>EGFP</italic> expression profiles compared following subretinal (SR) or intravitreal (IV) injection into eyes of wild type mice.

Therefore the efficacy of EGFP detection is higher in sections than wholemounts, resulting in higher numbers of EGFP-positive cells.
