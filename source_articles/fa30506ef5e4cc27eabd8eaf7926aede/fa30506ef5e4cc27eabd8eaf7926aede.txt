Introduction $i$Clostridiodes difficile$/i$ ($i$Clostridium difficile$/i$), an anaerobic, opportunistic pathogen, is the causative agent of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ infection (CDI), a debilitating condition with symptoms ranging from mild diarrhoea to severe pseudomembranous colitis. ~453,000 cases of CDI were reported in the United States in 2011 1 and there have been increasing reports of CDI from different parts of the world 2 – 4 . Treatment of CDI is complicated by the fact that 20–36% of cases experience recurrence, relapsing after completion of initial treatment 5 . CDI is primarily a hospital-acquired infection with the elderly being at highest risk 6 and has been associated with the disruption of the gut microbiota as a result of the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, more recently, there has been a reported increase in community-acquired cases where patients do not have the typical risk factors such as antibiotic exposure or recent hospitalisation 7 . Colonisation of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ and development of CDI is influenced by composition of the native gut microbiota. Broadly, $i$Bacteroides$/i$, $i$Prevotella$/i$, $i$Bifidobacterium$/i$, $i$Enterococcaceae$/i$ and $i$Leuconostocaceae spp$/i$. correlate negatively 8 – 10 , and Lactobacilli, $i$Aerococcaceae$/i$, $i$Enterobacteriaceae$/i$, and $i$Clostridium$/i$ correlate positively to $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ colonisation and disease 8 , 10 – 13 . While mechanisms underlying colonisation resistance are not entirely clear, some pathways have been described recently. Secondary bile acids produced by bacteria like $i$Clostridium scindens$/i$ can inhibit $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ growth, while other bile acids such as chenodeoxycholate can inhibit spore germination 14 – 16 . Studies have shown that the ability of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ to utilise metabolites produced by the gut microbiota or mucosal sugars such as sialic acid promote $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ expansion in the gut 17 , 18 . However, gaps still remain in our understanding of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ interactions with members of the gut microbiota. Research into CDI has primarily focused on the action of two large toxins 19 , 20 that cause tissue damage, neutrophil recruitment and a severe inflammatory response 21 . More recently, a number of factors have been shown to influence adhesion of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ to host cells and early colonisation, including cell wall proteins, adhesins and flagella 22 – 26 . $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ also produces biofilms that confer increased resistance to antibiotics 27 – 29 and have recently shown to be associated with $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ infection $i$in vivo$/i$, in close association with other commensal gut species 30 . Formation of adherent communities within the gut requires communication between bacteria. For many species, quorum sensing (QS) is important for the construction and/or dispersal of biofilm communities 31 , with bacteria utilising diverse QS systems 31 , 32 . Many bacteria possess the metabolic enzyme LuxS, which is involved in the detoxification of S-adenoslylhomocysteine during the activated methyl cycle. Whilst catalysing the reaction of S-ribosylhomocysteine to homocysteine, LuxS produces the bi-product 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD). DPD is an unstable compound that spontaneously cyclises into several different forms. These ligands are collectively known as autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a group of potent, cross-species QS signalling molecules 33 . In many bacteria, including $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$, AI-2 plays a role in biofilm formation, with $i$luxS$/i$ mutants showing a defect during biofilm formation and development 27 , 34 – 39 . The precise mode of action for LuxS in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ has remained elusive as a result of conflicting studies and the lack of a clear receptor for AI-2 34 , 40 , 41 . Here we investigate the role of LuxS within $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ and mixed biofilm communities. Interestingly, we find that $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ LuxS/AI-2 mediates the induction of two putative $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ R20291 prophages within $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms. In mixed biofilms, we show that in the presence of $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$, a gut bacterium, $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ growth is inhibited and this inhibition is alleviated in the absence of LuxS. Dual species transcriptomics show that distinct metabolic pathways are triggered in mixed cultures with the wild type (WT) and $i$luxS$/i$ mutant $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ strains. Results LuxS mediates biofilm formation $i$in vitro$/i$ We previously reported that a R20291 $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile luxS$/i$ mutant ($i$luxS$/i$) was defective in biofilm formation as measured by crystal violet (CV) staining 27 . However, in our subsequent studies, although we see a reduction in biofilms at 24 h, we observe a high variability in the WT biofilms formed at 24 h and in the reduction in the $i$luxS$/i$ mutant between experiments (Fig.  1A ). Nevertheless, the biofilm defect for $i$luxS$/i$ was very consistent at later time points (72 h) (Fig.  1A,B ). In spite of differences in total biofilm content, colony counts from the WT and $i$luxS$/i$ biofilms were similar at both time points (Fig.  1C ). There were also no differences in the spore content of WT and $i$luxS$/i$ biofilms (~0.003% at 24 h and ~0.1% at 72 h) (Fig.  S1 ). Figure 1 $i$LuxS$/i$ biofilm defect is reversed by addition of DPD. ( A ) WT and $i$LuxS$/i$ biofilms were grown for 24 h or 72 h and stained with 0.2% CV, followed by measuring OD 570 , N = 5.

( D ) The AI-2 precursor, DPD, was exogenously supplemented to $i$LuxS$/i$ at a concentration of 100 nM, followed by biofilm staining and quantitation with 0.2% CV after 72 h (N = 4). Error bars indicate SD, *$i$p$/i$ &lt; 0.05, **$i$p$/i$ &lt; 0.01, ***$i$p$/i$ &lt; 0.001 as determined by Student’s t-test or by Mann-Whitney U test, ns- not significant. To determine if AI-2 signalling is involved in biofilm formation, we first performed an AI-2 assay from both planktonic and biofilm supernatants as described by Carter $i$et al$/i$. 2005 (Fig.  S2A ). AI-2 is produced maximally in mid-log and stationary phases as previously reported 40 . The WT strain produced less AI-2 in 24 h biofilms compared to log phase culture, while the $i$luxS$/i$ strain did not produce AI-2 as expected (Fig.  S2B ). To study if the reduction in biofilm formation in $i$luxS$/i$ could be complemented by chemically synthesised 4,5-dihydroxy-2, 3-pentanedione (DPD), the precursor of AI-2, was supplemented in the culture medium. Whilst high concentrations (&gt;1000 nM) appeared to have only a partial effect on biofilm formation (Fig.  S3 ), a concentration of 100 nM was capable of restoring the WT phenotype (Fig.  1D ), indicating that AI-2 may be involved in signalling within $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms. RNA-seq analysis reveals LuxS-mediated prophage induction To investigate mechanism of action of LuxS/AI-2 in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$, transcriptional profiles of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ WT and $i$luxS$/i$ strains planktonically cultured (OD 600 0.8 in BHI) were first compared using RNA-seq. However, surprisingly, no differential transcriptional changes were observed (Accession number E-MTAB-7486). Following this, an RNA-seq analysis was performed with total RNA isolated from $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ WT and $i$luxS$/i$ biofilms grown in BHIS +0.1 M glucose [(BHIS-G) conditions used for biofilm assays in Fig.  1 ] for 18 h (Accession number E-MTAB-7523). Both strains show similar planktonic culture growth rates in BHIS-G as reported previously 27 . The DESeq2 variance analysis package 42 was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in $i$luxS$/i$ ≥1.6-fold relative to the WT strain, with a $i$p$/i$ -adjusted value ≤0.05. This pairwise analysis identified 21 differentially expressed genes (Fig.  2A,C ) (Table  1 ). Interestingly, all 18 down-regulated genes correspond to two prophage regions located within the $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ R20291 genome, CDR20291_1415–1464 and CDR20291_1197–1226 (Fig.  2B ), as identified using the online phage search tool, Phaster 43 , 44 . A Fisher’s exact test ($i$p$/i$-value &lt; 0.001 for both prophage regions) further confirmed an enrichment of differently regulated genes in prophage regions. There were only three genes upregulated in the $i$luxS$/i$ biofilms compared to the WT; two of these were involved in trehalose utilisation, while the third was a phosphotransferase system glucose-specific transporter. Figure 2 Down-regulation of prophage genes in the $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile luxS$/i$ mutant. ( A ) Pairwise analysis identified 21 differentially expressed genes in $i$luxS$/i$ (red points). All 18 down-regulated genes clustered into two regions. ( B ) Three prophage regions are identified in the $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ genome using Phaster. Regions 2 and 3 were down regulated in $i$luxS$/i$. ( C ) Heat map representation of the genes that were differentially expressed in $i$luxS,$/i$ red and green indicate down- and up-regulation respectively when compared to WT. 18 prophage genes were found to be down-regulated in $i$luxS$/i$ relative to WT, whilst two genes involved in trehalose metabolism were up-regulated in $i$luxS$/i$ relative to WT. Data shown is the mean of 3 independent experiments in triplicates. Differential expression was defined as ≥1.6-fold change relative to WT with an adjusted $i$p$/i$-value ≤ 0.05.

To demonstrate the presence of phage in the biofilm, cell-free supernatants were treated with DNase, before a subsequent DNA extraction was performed. As the bacterial cells were already removed, only DNA within intact bacteriophages would be protected from DNase. A 16S rRNA gene PCR was performed to confirm digestion of all free extracellular genomic DNA from the biofilm (Fig.  3A ). PCRs with primers corresponding to genes specific to each prophage, confirmed that the DNA extracted had come from the phage (Fig.  3B ). Since cell lysis is linked to phage release, we quantified and compared the total extracellular DNA (eDNA) content of $i$luxS$/i$ mutant and WT biofilms. The WT biofilms contained more eDNA compared to the $i$luxS$/i$ mutant at 24 h and 72 h (Fig.  3C ). Overall, these data suggest that AI-2 may play a role in inducing prophages in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms, which leads to phage-mediated host cell lysis and eDNA generation, which may contribute to subsequent biofilm accumulation. Figure 3 Presence of phage and eDNA in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms. The phage origin of DNA isolated from WT biofilms was confirmed by PCR, using primers for 16S ( A ) and two phage genes (CDR20291_1436 and CDR20291_1208) ( B ). The negative controls were run on a different part of the same gel. The gel pictures were trimmed with no adjustment to the intensities. WT-1–3 are three biological replicates.

As an inter-species signalling function has been previously proposed for AI-2 45 , we sought to investigate the interactions between a gut-associated $i$Bacteroides spp$/i$ and $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$. We examined $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ interactions with $i$Bacteriodes fragilis$/i$, a gut commensal and pathogen, that has been previously reported to negatively correlate with CDI infections 46 . $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ formed significantly more biofilms $i$in vitro$/i$ compared with $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ in monocultures, as measured by CV staining (Fig.  4A ). When both organisms were co-cultured, less biofilm was formed compared to $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ monoculture (Fig.  4A ). Both $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ and $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ grow well, although with slightly different growth rates, in BHIS-G (Fig.  S4 ). To investigate the impact of co-culturing on both $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ and $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$, bacterial numbers (CFU/ml) were determined from monoculture and mixed biofilms (Fig.  4B ). Colony counts obtained from the mono and co-culture biofilms confirmed that $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ was a poor biofilm producer when cultured alone. Interestingly, when both species were co-cultured, the CFU/ml for $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ was significantly reduced, and the CFU/ml of $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ was significantly higher. This reduction of colony counts of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ was observed at both 24 h (Fig.  4B ) and 72 h (Fig.  S5 ). AI-2 production from single and mixed biofilms was also quantitated. We observed no production of AI-2 by $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$, and a reduction of AI-2 production by the mixed biofilms compared with the WT $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms (Fig.  S6 ). $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ spore measurements from the mixed biofilms indicate that while the percentage of spores is higher (2%) due to the decrease in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ numbers, there was no increase in the actual spore numbers (Fig.  S7 ). These data suggest that the presence of $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ in biofilms results in inhibition of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ growth. Figure 4 $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ mediated inhibition of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ in mixed biofilms.

To understand if the inhibitory effect was due to a factor secreted by $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$, $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ and $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ were co-cultured under planktonic conditions for 6 h and 10 h (Fig.  4C ). However, there were no significant differences in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ bacterial numbers between mono and co-culture. Additionally, supplementing biofilms with $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ planktonic or biofilm culture supernatants did not cause $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ growth inhibition (Fig.  S8 ), indicating that the observed inhibitory effects were specific to adherent biofilms i.e. when they are in close proximity to each other. LuxS is involved in the $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ inhibition of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ To study the role of LuxS in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$-$i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ interactions, WT $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ and $i$luxS$/i$ strains were co-cultured with $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ in mixed biofilms. CV staining of biofilms showed that there was less $i$luxS$/i$ biofilm formed compared to the WT when co-cultured with $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ (Fig.  5A ). While colony counts of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ in monocultures were similar for both WT and $i$luxS$/i$ strains (Fig.  1B ), when co-cultured with $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ the bacterial counts for both $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ strains were significantly reduced, although the reduction was significantly higher for the WT than $i$luxS$/i$ (Fig.  5B ). Colony counts for $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ increased significantly during co-culture, with similar levels observed in both co-culture conditions (Fig.  5B ). There was no increase in the spore numbers in the $i$luxS$/i$ in mixed biofilms (Fig.  S7 ). These data suggest that AI2/LuxS is involved in mediating the $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$-induced inhibition of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$, when they are within adherent communities.

Differentially expressed genes were defined as having ≥1.6-fold relative to their respective control (mono-cultures of either $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ or $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ WT), with an adjusted $i$p$/i$-adjusted value ≤ 0.05.

Eight up-regulated genes were specific to $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ WT co-culture (Table  2 ). Of these, four genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism: $i$fabH$/i$ encoding 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier protein] synthase III, $i$fabK$/i$ encoding trans-2-enoyl-ACP reductase, $i$accC$/i$ encoding a biotin carboxylase (acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunit A), and $i$accB$/i$ encoding a biotin carboxyl carrier protein of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Table  2 ). 11 genes were down-regulated exclusively in WT however, these genes do not coincide with a specific metabolic pathway. 18 up-regulated genes were specific to $i$luxS$/i$ in co-culture (Table  3 ). These include a putative homocysteine S-methyltransferase, a putative osmoprotectant ABC transporter, substrate binding/ permease protein, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase alpha chain ($i$nrdE$/i$) and two genes from the trehalose operon: a PTS system II ABC transporter, and trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase (treA). 24 genes were down-regulated (Table  3 ), which include 3 genes involved in thiamine metabolism $i$thiD$/i$, $i$thiK$/i$ and $i$thiE1$/i$, (CDR20291_1497, CDR20291_1498 and CDR20291_1499 respectively) which encode a putative phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase, 4-methyl-5-beta-hydroxyethylthiazole kinase and thiamine-phosphate pyrophosphorylase respectively. A total of 26 genes were differentially expressed in both $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ WT and $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile luxS$/i$ when co-cultured with $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ (Fig.  6A , Table  S1 ). These include six up-regulated genes ($i$accB$/i$, $i$abfH$/i$, $i$abfT$/i$, $i$abfD$/i$, $i$sucD$/i$ and $i$cat1$/i$) involved in carbon and butanoate metabolism, with $i$cat1$/i$, which encodes succinyl-CoA:coenzyme A transferase, being the highest up-regulated gene for both $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ strains. When $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ WT-$i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ mixed biofilms and $i$luxS$/i$-$i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ mixed biofilms were compared to $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ single biofilms, in contrast, a higher number of genes (266) were differentially expressed in $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ when co-cultured with $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ (WT and $i$luxS$/i$) (Table  S4 , Fig.  6B ). A total of 114 $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ genes were found to be specific to $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ WT co-culture, with 56 of these up-regulated and 58 down-regulated (Table  S2 ). Similarly, 91 genes were found to be specific to $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile luxS$/i$ co-culture, with 56 of these up-regulated and 35 down-regulated (Table  S3 ). Although distinct $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ expression profiles were observed with the WT and $i$luxS$/i$ (Fig.  6B ), there were no clear pathways identified in the datasets. Whilst the highest up-regulated gene in both WT and LuxS co-cultures encodes a putative virus attachment protein, no other viral genes were shown to be up-regulated (Table  S4 ). Genes encoding iron containing proteins desulfoferrodoxin and rubrerythrin were highly up-regulated in both conditions. Interestingly, multiple copies of $i$fecR$/i$, a key regulator for the ferric citrate transport system 47 , and ferrous iron transport protein B were also up-regulated. Additionally, a number of other metabolic pathways were up-regulated, including four genes (encoding 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase small subunit, 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, Galactokinase and 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase large subunit) involved in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism. It should be noted that many of the up-regulated genes were hypothetical proteins of unknown function. Similarly, several metabolic pathways were down-regulated in both co-culture conditions. These include six genes involved in carbon metabolism, four genes involved in alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and four genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, although these appear to be single genes rather than specific pathways. Discussion Inter-bacterial interactions within gut communities are critical in controlling invasion by intestinal pathogens. Quorum sensing molecules such as AI-2 are instrumental in bacterial communication, especially during formation of bacterial communities 31 , 36 , 37 , 48 – 50 . $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ produces AI-2, although the mechanism of action of LuxS/AI-2 in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$, particularly within a biofilm community is unclear. We report here that the $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ LuxS/AI-2 plays an important role in the formation of single and multi-species communities. In $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms, LuxS mediates the induction of prophages, which likely contributes to the biofilm structure. Whereas, in a mixed biofilm of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ and the intestinal commensal and pathogen, $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$, LuxS likely triggers the induction of differential metabolic responses in $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$, that leads to growth inhibition of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$. To our knowledge, this is the first time dual species RNA-seq 51 has been applied to analyse interactions between anaerobic gut bacteria in an adherent biofilm community. Bacterial biofilms contain a number of extracellular components that make up their complex structure including extracellular DNA (eDNA), a key component that binds together bacteria within a community. Autolysis is a common mechanism by which eDNA is released from bacterial cells 52 . In bacteria such as $i$Staphylococcus aureus$/i$ and $i$Pseudomonas aeruginosa$/i$, eDNA is generated through the lysis of subpopulations within a biofilm, under the control of quorum sensing 52 – 55 . In $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile luxS$/i$ mutant ($i$luxS$/i$) biofilms, we observe reduced induction of two $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ prophages compared with the WT. These phage loci were conserved in several $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ strains with the Region 2 encoding a phiC2-like, phi-027 phage 56 – 58 . Given that it has previously been shown that eDNA is a major component of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms 27 , 30 , it is likely that phage-mediated bacterial cell lysis and subsequent DNA release help build a biofilm. Indeed, given the detection of eDNA in the $i$luxS$/i$ biofilms, there are likely other unknown eDNA release mechanisms during $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilm formation. Phages are also known to control biofilm structure in some organisms: a filamentous phage of $i$P$/i$. $i$aeruginosa$/i$ was reported to be a structural component of the biofilm 59 and an AI-2 induced phage mediated the dispersal of $i$Enterococcus faecalis$/i$ biofilms 60 . Although attempts to visualise phages from $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms with transmission electron microscopy (data not shown) were unsuccessful, we cannot rule out the possibility that $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ phages may directly influence the biofilm structure. While the precise mechanisms by which LuxS/AI-2 controls phage induction are yet to be elucidated, AI-2 appears to be signalling through a yet unidentified AI-2 receptor in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$. Phage-mediated control of biofilms may in part explain the variation observed in biofilm formation between different $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ strains 61 . The human gut hosts a variety of bacterial species, which compete or coexist with each other. It is likely that the bacteria occupying this niche form multi-species bacterial communities in association with the mucus layer. Interactions within such communities are important in gaining a better understanding of phenomena such as ‘colonisation resistance’ which prevents pathogens such as $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ from establishing an infection 14 . Whilst sequencing studies have identified members of the $i$Bacteroides$/i$ genus as being associated with gut colonisation resistance to $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$, the mechanisms have remained elusive 10 . A recent study demonstrated that production of the enzyme: bile salt hydrolase, is responsible for the inhibitory effect of $i$B$/i$. $i$ovatus$/i$ on $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ 62 . This study reported that in the presence of bile acids, cell free supernatants for $i$B$/i$. $i$ovatus$/i$ were capable of inhibiting the growth of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ whereas in the absence of bile acids, $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ growth was promoted. Since bile acids are not supplemented into our media, a different mechanism is likely responsible for $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ mediated inhibition of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$. Also, the growth restraining effects of $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ on $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ were evident only within mixed biofilms, not in planktonic culture or with culture supernatants. While it is likely that cell-cell contact is essential for the inhibitory effect, we cannot exclude involvement of an inhibitory secreted molecule that accumulates to a higher concentration within a biofilm environment, or that $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ has a competitive growth advantage in a biofilm environment. A dual species RNA-seq analysis performed to understand the interactions between the two bacterial species, showed that largely all the differentially expressed genes mapped to distinct metabolic pathways. Overall, a higher number of genes were modulated in $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ as compared to $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ strain during co-culture, which is in line with the growth characteristics observed. Carbon and butanoate metabolism pathways were induced in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ strains in response to co-culture ($i$accB$/i$, $i$abfH$/i$, $i$abfT$/i$, $i$abfD$/i$, $i$sucD$/i$ and $i$cat1$/i$). An up-regulation of the succinate utilisation genes was also recently reported in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ 630 microfermenter biofilm cells as compared to planktonic cells 63 . As $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ is known to produce succinate 64 , it is likely that the upregulation in these pathways results from the increased levels of succinate in the culture medium. However, since gut microbiota-produced succinate promotes $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ growth $i$in vivo$/i$ 17 , it is unlikely that these changes are directly responsible for the observed inhibition of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$. However, bacteria utilise carbohydrates in a sequential manner 65 . Consistent with this, we observed a down-regulation of genes important for the utilisation of pyruvate such as $i$bcd2$/i$ and $i$idhA$/i$ encoding for butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and (r)-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase respectively. A down-regulation of sugar fermentation pathway genes was also observed by Poquet $i$et al$/i$. in single species $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms compared to planktonic cultures 63 . Such a shift in metabolism could allow $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ to fully consume other metabolites, and thus enabling it to outcompete $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$. Additionally, it is interesting to note that a number of copies of the ferric citrate transport system regulator, $i$fecR$/i$, are up-regulated in $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ during $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ co-culture. The ferric citrate transport system is an iron uptake system that responds to the presence of citrate 47 , 66 . Analysis of the $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ genome using BLAST (NCBI) showed that $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ does not possess this iron uptake system. Given the evidence that ferric citrate is an iron source in the gut 47 , 67 , $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ may have an advantage over $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ in sequestering iron, and thus preventing $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ colonisation. Although the clear modulation of metabolic pathways strongly suggest a competitive advantage of $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ over $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$, it is possible that the genes with unknown functions that are differentially expressed in $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ (Table  S1 ), encode pathways for the production of yet to be identified small inhibitory molecules. The LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing system is known to have a cross-species signalling role in many bacteria 45 , 68 . While all sequenced $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ strains produce AI-2, only selected strains of $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ have the ability to produce AI-2 69 . A recent study showed that $i$Ruminococcus obeuem$/i$ inhibited $i$Vibrio cholerae$/i$ in the gut via LuxS/AI-2 mediated downregulation of $i$V$/i$. $i$cholerae$/i$ colonisation factors 70 . Also, AI-2 produced by engineered $i$E$/i$. $i$coli$/i$ was reported to influence firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratios in microbiota treated with streptomycin 71 . Our data show the involvement of LuxS/AI-2 in the $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$-mediated $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ growth inhibition. As the $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ strain used in this study does not produce AI-2, it is likely that $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ responds differentially to AI-2 produced by $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$. Similar to the WT, most transcriptional changes were in metabolic pathways, although specific sets of genes were modulated in the $i$luxS$/i$ mutant. Modulation of prophage genes was not seen, unlike single biofilm cultures, indicating different dominant mechanisms at play in a multi-species environment. It was interesting to note that the trehalose utilisation operon, which provides a growth advantage to $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ against other gut bacteria 72 , was upregulated in both the single $i$luxS$/i$ biofilms (Table  1 ) and $i$luxS$/i$ co-cultured with $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ (Table  3 ). The upregulation of a phosphotransferase system component and $i$treA$/i$ (both in the same operon), likely enables increased utilisation of trehalose, providing an additional carbon source. Like glucose, trehalose acts as an osmoprotectant 73 and its presence within the cell may help maintain protein conformation during cellular dehydration. It is possible that trehalose plays a role in building $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms, as reported for $i$Candida$/i$ biofilms 74 . Our preliminary studies with exogenous trehalose levels similar to those used by Collins $i$et al$/i$. (2018) showed an inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by both WT $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ and $i$luxS$/i$, although no differential effects were observed between $i$luxS$/i$ and WT (Fig.  S9 ). However, further investigations into accumulation of trehalose within biofilms are required to clarify the role of trehalose in $i$luxS$/i$ mediated biofilm formation. In conclusion, we report that $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ LuxS/AI-2 may play a key role in building $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ communities through mediating prophage induction, and subsequent accumulation of eDNA. In mixed communities, $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ AI-2 likely signals to $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ to induce an altered metabolic response, enabling it to outgrow $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$. Further studies are required to understand the precise AI-2 sensing pathways involved. Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and media Two bacterial species were used in this study – $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ strain: B1/NAP1/027 R20291 (isolated from the Stoke Mandeville outbreak in 2004 and 2005), and $i$Bacteroides fragilis$/i$ (a clinical isolate from a biliary stent kindly provided by Dr Claudia Vuotto and Dr Gianfranco Donelli, Rome). A $i$luxS$/i$ Clostron R20291 mutant described previously in Dapa $i$et al$/i$. 27 was used in this study. Both species were cultured under anaerobic conditions (80% N 2 , 10% CO 2 , 10% H 2 ) at 37 °C in an anaerobic workstation (Don Whitley, United Kingdom) in BHIS, supplemented with L-Cysteine (0.1% w/v; Sigma, United Kingdom), yeast extract (5 g/l; Oxoid) and glucose (0.1 M). $i$Vibrio harveyi$/i$ strain: BB170 was used to measure AI-2. $i$V$/i$. $i$harveyi$/i$ strains were cultured in aerobic conditions at 30 °C in Lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml). Biofilm formation assay Biofilms were grown as per the previously published protocol 27 . Overnight cultures of $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ were diluted 1:100 in fresh BHIS with 0.1 M glucose. 1 ml aliquots were pipetted into 24-well tissue culture treated polystyrene plates (Costar), and incubated under anaerobic condition at 37 °C, for 6–120 h. Tissue culture plates were pre-incubated for 48 h prior to use. The plates were wrapped with parafilm to prevent liquid evaporation. Measurement of biofilm biomass Biofilm biomass was measured using crystal violet (CV) 27 . After the required incubation, each well of the 24-well plate was washed with sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and allowed to dry for a minimum of 10 mins. The biofilm was stained using 1 ml of filter-sterilised 0.2% CV and incubated for 30 mins at 37 °C, in anaerobic conditions. The CV was removed from each well, and wells were subsequently washed twice with sterile PBS. The dye was extracted by incubated with 1 ml methanol for 30 mins at room temperature in aerobic conditions. The methanol-extracted dye was diluted 1:1, 1:10 or 1:100 and OD 570 was measured with a spectrophotometer (BMG Labtech, UK). For bacterial cell counts from the biofilm, the planktonic phase was removed and wells were washed once using sterile PBS. The adherent biofilms were then detached by scrapping with a sterile pipette tip and re-suspended into 1 ml PBS. Serial dilutions were made and plated onto BHIS plates to determine the CFU present in the biofilm. Co-culture biofilm assay For generation of co-culture biofilms, both $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ and $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ were diluted to an OD 600 of 1. Both species were diluted 1:100 into fresh BHIS with 0.1 M glucose. Biofilms assays were performed as described above and measured by a combination of CV staining and CFU. To distinguish between $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ and $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$, serial dilutions used for determining CFU were plated on BHIS plates additionally supplemented with $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ selective supplement (Oxoid, UK). Colonies can be differentiated by size and colony morphology as $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ form very small colonies. Exogenous addition of DPD To analyse the potential signalling role of AI-2, biofilm assays were performed as described above in BHIS with 0.1 M glucose containing 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, or 1 µM of chemically synthesised, exogenous 4,5-Dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (Omm Scientific, Texas USA) for both $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ WT and LuxS. BHIS with 0.1 M glucose was used as a control. Samples were washed and stained with 0.2% CV at either 24 h or 72 h. AI-2 Assay The AI-2 bioluminescence assay was carried out essentially as described by Bassler $i$et al$/i$. 1993 75 . The $i$V$/i$. $i$harveyi$/i$ reporter strain BB170 was grown overnight in LB medium before being diluted 1: 5000 in Autoinducer Bioassay (AB) medium containing 10% (v/v) cell-free conditioned medium collected from either planktonic or biofilm $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ cultures (in BHI) and allowed to grow at 30 °C with shaking. AB medium containing 10% (v/v) from $i$V$/i$. $i$harveyi$/i$ BB120 was used as a positive control, and 10% (v/v) sterile BHI medium as a blank. Luminescence was measured every hour using a SPECTROstar Omega plate reader. Induction of luminescence was taken at the time when there was maximal difference between the positive and negative controls (usually 2–5 h) and is expressed as a percentage of the induction observed in the positive control. RNA-seq Biofilms were grown for 18 h in BHIS + glucose, supernatants were removed and attached biofilms were washed with 1 ml PBS. Biofilms were disrupted and RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, UK). 5 µg of extracted RNA was treated with RiboZERO TM (Illumina, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol to deplete rRNA. cDNA libraries were prepared using TruSEQ LT (Illumina, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, samples were end-repaired, mono-adenylated, ligated to index/adaptors. Libraries were quantified by bioanalyzer and fluorometer assay. The final cDNA library was prepared to a concentration of 10–12 pM and sequenced using paired end technology using a version-3 150-cycle kit on an Illumina MiSeq TM (Illumina, UK). RNA-seq analysis The paired-end sequencing reads from RNA-seq experiments were mapped against the appropriate reference genome (NC_013316 for $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ and a de novo assembly using RNA SPAdes v3.9 with default settings 76 from the RNA-sequence reads for $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ [Accession number PRJEB29695). The first read was flipped into the correct orientation using seqtk v1.3 ( https://github.com/lh3/seqtk ) and the reads were mapped against the reference genome using BWA v0.7.5 with the ‘mem’ alignment algorithm 77 . BAM files were manipulated with Samtools v0.1.18 using the ‘view’ and ‘sort’ settings 77 . Sorted BAM and GFF (general feature format) files were inputted into the coverageBed tool v2.27.0 with default settings 78 to gain abundance of each genomic feature. The R package DESeq2 was used with default settings to calculate differential gene expression using a negative binomial distribution model 42 . The data was filtered by applying a cut-off of 1.6 for the fold change and 0.05 for the adjusted $i$p$/i$-value. All sequencing reads were submitted to the European Bioinformatics Institute (Accession numbers E-MTAB-7486, E-MTAB-7523 and PRJEB29695). As analysis by BLAST (NCBI) demonstrated species specificity for mapping, co-culture samples were mapped to each species reference separately. Initial mapping of the $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ strain to a published reference proved unsuccessful, offering a poor rate of alignment of 60%. As the $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ strain has not been previously sequenced, and because we were not successful in generating high quality genome sequence, a reference was generated from RNA library of $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ using the software rnaSPAdes v3.9 79 and annotated using Prokka v1.11 (default settings) 80 . The reads from each condition were mapped to their respective reference sequence using BWA v0.7.5 (‘mem’ algorithm) 77 , 81 and counted using coverageBed v2.27.0 78 . Metabolic pathways in $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ were identified using the KEGG mapper 82 , a tool that identifies the function of genes in a published genome. As the $i$B$/i$. $i$fragilis$/i$ strain used in this study does not have a published reference genome, blastKOALA 83 was used to search for gene homology within metabolic pathways. Heatmaps were generated from normalised gene expression data outputted from DESeq2, using the online tool Heatmapper 84 using the default settings. PCR analysis 16S PCRs were performed using the universal 16S rRNA bacterial primers 27F and 1392R (Table  S2 ). Primers were constructed for prophage genes CDR20219_1208 and CDR20291_1436 (Table  S2 ) to confirm the presence of prophage within $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms. PCR was carried out using Fusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 mins followed by 35 cycles of: 95 °C for 30 seconds, 51 °C for 30 seconds and 72 °C for 30 seconds, after which samples were heated to 72 °C for 10 mins. eDNA quantification eDNA was extracted from $i$C$/i$. $i$difficile$/i$ biofilms grown in a 24-well plate as described above, using a protocol described in Rice $i$et al$/i$. 53 . Briefly, the plate was sealed with parafilm and chilled at 4 °C for 1 hour. 1 μl 0.5 M EDTA was added to each well and incubated at 4 °C for 5 mins. The medium was removed and biofilms were resuspended in 300 μl 50 mM TES buffer (50 mM Tris HCl/10 mM EDTA/500 mM NaCl). The OD 600 was measured to determine biofilm biomass and the tubes were centrifuged at 4 °C at 18,000 g for 5 mins, and was used to normalise the eDNA values. 100 μl of supernatant was transferred to a tube of chilled TE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl/ 1 mM EDTA) on ice. DNA was extracted using an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol three times. 3 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol and 1/10 volumes 3 M sodium acetate were added to the aqueous phase to precipitate the DNA. The DNA pellet was washed with 1 ml ice-cold 70% ethanol, dissolved in 20 μl TE buffer, quantified by Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). Spore counts To determine the number of spores, adherent biofilms were resuspended in PBS and treated at 65 °C for 25 mins as previously described 85 . Untreated and heat-treated samples were serial diluted and plated on BHIS and BHIS-TC agar (supplemented with 0.1% sodium taurocholate, Sigma-Aldrich, UK). No bacteria were obtained from the heat-treated samples plated on BHI (without sodium taurocholate). The CFU/ml obtained from heat-treated samples plated on BHIS-TC plates represent heat-resistant spores, and the CFU/ml obtained from untreated samples plated on BHIS plates represent the total cell counts. Statistical analysis All experiments were performed in triplicate, with at least three independent experiments performed. Paired or unpaired student’s t-test was used to determine if differences between two groups were significant, and one way-ANOVA was used to compare multiple groups. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare non-parametric data. Fisher’s exact t-test was used to confirm the enrichment of differently regulated genes in prophage regions.
