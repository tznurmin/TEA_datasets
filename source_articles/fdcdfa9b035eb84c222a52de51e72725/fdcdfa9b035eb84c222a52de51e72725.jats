This lytic cycle is delicately regulated by calcium-dependent reversible phosphorylation of the molecular machinery that drives invasion and egress. While much progress has been made elucidating the protein kinases and substrates central to parasite propagation, little is known about the relevant protein phosphatases. In this study, we focused on the five protein phosphatases that are predicted to be membrane-associated either integrally or peripherally. We have determined that of these only PPM5C, a PP2C family member, localizes to the plasma membrane of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Disruption of PPM5C results in a slow propagation phenotype in tissue culture. Interestingly, parasites lacking PPM5C divide and undergo egress at a normal rate, but have a deficiency in attaching to host cells. Both membrane localization and phosphatase activity are required for PPM5C’s role in attachment. Phosphoproteomic analysis show relatively few phosphorylation sites being affected by PPM5C deletion in extracellular parasites of which several are found on proteins involved in signaling cascades. This implies that PPM5C is part of a wider regulatory network important for attachment to host cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>U.S. Department of Health &amp;amp;

Infection with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> occurs either by consumption of undercooked or raw meat from infected animals, ingestion of environmental oocysts that are the products of sexual reproduction in cats and are expelled in their feces, or thorough congenital transmission. In hosts other than cats, the parasite undergoes asexual reproduction and exist in two forms, a rapidly dividing tachyzoite responsible for acute infection, and a tissue cyst forming bradyzoite, which establishes a chronic infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. As the acute stage is sensitive to the host’s immune response, in healthy people, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection is usually asymptomatic. However, in the absence of a robust immune system, which is the case in those immunocompromised or immunosuppressed and in the developing fetus, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> can multiply unchecked and cause life threatening disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Main clinical manifestations of toxoplasmosis include encephalitis and cardiomyopathy in HIV/AIDS, cancer and immunosuppressed patients and stillbirth, hydrocephalus, neurological abnormalities in congenital infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The symptoms of severe toxoplasmosis are in great part the result of the tissue damage caused by repeated cycles of parasite entry into cells, replication, and lytic egress. These steps, along with attachment and motility, are exquisitely regulated by coordinated secretion from three unique organelles, micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Micronemes secrete proteins that are critical for motility, formation of a tight junction between the parasite and the host cell, and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Calcium dependent reversible phosphorylation has been shown to play a critical role in regulating microneme secretion and activation of the motility system during egress and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In particular, members of the calcium dependent protein kinase (CDPK) family, which are unique to plants and apicomplexan parasites, play critical roles during the lytic cycle of the parasite. CDPK1, for instance, has been shown to be part of a signaling pathway that leads to secretion of microneme proteins required for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> motility, invasion, and egress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Similarly, we have shown that CDPK3 initiates rapid egress by regulating the phosphorylation state of the motor protein myosin A (MyoA), which powers the gliding motility system required to enter and exit host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Interestingly, many components of the parasite’s motility system, referred to as the glideosome, have been shown to be regulated by reversible phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Comparative phosphoproteomic studies in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> suggest that dephosphorylation also plays an important role in the parasite’s progression through its lytic cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It has been reported that dephosphorylation of two residues (Ser163 and 167) of the glideosome associated protein 45 (GAP45), is required for the assembly of the MyoA-MLC1-GAP45 motor complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the relevance of this dephosphorylation has been put into question by later work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Dephosphorylation does appear to play a role in regulating the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), which mediates host cell attachment and invasion. Dephosphorylation of the cytosolic tail of AMA1 enhances <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>’s invasion into host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that protein phosphatases play critical roles in the propagation of the parasite.</p><p id="Par5">While many of the kinases that play a role in the lytic cycle have been identified, very little is known of the phosphatases that contribute to regulation of parasite propagation. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> encodes more than 60 predicted protein phosphatases including 52 serine/threonine phosphatases (PSPs) and 9 tyrosine phosphatases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Since most phosphorylated sites detected in lytic cycle effector proteins are primarily serine and threonine residues, phosphatases involved in their dephosphorylation are more likely to be PSPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Among these PSPs, only calcineurin, a phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family PSP, has been shown to be involved in the regulation of the lytic cycle of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Specifically, calcineurin plays a role in microneme independent host cell attachment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">To expand on our knowledge of phosphatases that might play a role in the regulation of the parasite’s lytic cycle, we have begun to study PSPs that would be predicted to associate with the parasite membrane. This criterion is due to the fact that the glideosome is located at the periphery of the parasite between the membrane and the inner membrane complex (IMC), a set of flattened vesicles that underlay the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In this study, we determine that the protein phosphatase PPM5C, a PP2C family member containing both N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation sites, localizes to the plasma membrane where it regulates attachment to host cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>PPM5C is localized to the plasma membrane</title><p id="Par7">Among the putative serine/threonine protein phosphatases in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, five have features that would predict membrane association: two containing transmembrane domains (TGGT1_202610 aka PPM3D and TGGT1_304955 aka PPM11C), two possessing predicted myristoylation sites (TGGT1_232340 aka PPM2A and TGGT1_267100 aka PPM2B) and one with both putative myristoylation and palmitoylation sites (TGGT1_281580 aka PPM5C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) of the resulting strains showed that PPM2A and PPM2B are both distributed throughout the cytosol (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Interestingly, PPM2B appears to be excluded from the nucleus, while PPM2A is not. PPM3D, which has a predicted transmembrane domain, is not localized to the plasma membrane and instead it exhibits a localization pattern reminiscent of the ER. On the other hand, PPM5C appears to be localized to the periphery of the parasite, most likely to the plasma membrane (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). We also detected PPM5C in the residual body, a structure that arises during parasite division and contains remnants of mother cell left behind during the formation of daughter parasites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, Arrow)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. While it is plausible that PPM5C associates with IMC, we never see it associated with the IMC of daughter cells, which can clearly be observed with IMC markers such as IMC3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Localization of the protein phosphatases.

Nonetheless, the protein product detected by western blot is around 75 kDa, which is significantly less than the expected 308 kDa. Careful analysis of the gene model for TGGT1_304955, suggest that it is likely incorrect and that the predicted first 5 exons, which encode the phosphatase domain, and the last 4 exons, which encode 3 C-terminal transmembrane domains, are two separate genes. Several lines of evidence support this idea. First, while the gene model predicts a 3,677 bases intron between exons 5 and 6, there is no RNA sequence evidence for such splicing event and instead there is evidence for a 500 nucleotides intron following the fifth exon which would provide an in frame stop codon (ToxoDB, RNAseq ‘evidence for introns’ dataset). Second, several data sets from chromatin precipitations suggest the presence of promoter activity within the large intron prior to what is predicted as the sixth exon. Finally, within the large intron just prior to the sixth exon there is a potential in frame start methionine that, if used would predict a 63 kDa protein with a predicted signal sequence, which is consistent with what we observe by both IFA and western blot. Thus, TGGT1_304955 is likely misannotated and it represents two different proteins, one with a protein phosphatase domain, and a secreted one with a signal sequence and transmembrane domains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Amino acids predicted to be myristoylated or palmitoylated are both required for the plasma membrane localization of PPM5C</title><p id="Par10">As our interest is on protein phosphatases localized to the periphery of the parasite we focused our efforts on the functional characterization of PPM5C. Two amino acids in the N-terminus of PPM5C are predicted to be post-translationally modified: a glycine at position 2 is predicted to be myristoylated (Myristoylator)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and the cysteine at position 4 is predicted to be palmitoylated (CSS-Palm 4.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To explore whether these two amino acids are required for PPM5C localization to the plasma membrane, we generated parasite strains stably expressing an exogenous copy of wildtype PPM5C or PPM5C in which either the putative myristoylation or palmitoylation sites were mutated to alanine (G2A or C4A, respectively) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Western blot showed that the exogenously expressed proteins were of the expected sizes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). IFA of intracellular parasites showed that, as in the case of endogenous PPM5C, exogenously expressed PPM5C is localized to the plasma membrane and residual body (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). By contrast, in parasites expressing either PPM5C(G2A):3xHA or PPM5C(C4A):3xHA we detected the protein throughout the cytoplasm. The staining pattern for both mutants appears punctate, so it is plausible that both associate with membrane structures. Nonetheless, neither of the mutants is associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). These data suggest that both the second and fourth amino acids, which are putative myristoylation and palmitoylation sites, are required for plasma membrane localization of PPM5C.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Role of amino acids predicted to be myristoylated or palmitoylated in PPM5C localization.

To determine the particular step that is affected by the genetic disruption of <italic>PPM5C</italic>, we performed a battery of phenotypic assays. We first performed doubling assays to compare the division rate of ∆<italic>ppm5c</italic> to that of the parental and complement strains. Briefly, parasites were allowed to infect host cells for 30 minutes before removal of non-invaded parasites. Invaded parasites were allowed to grow for 18, 24, or 30 hours post infection at which time points cultures were fixed and the number of parasites per vacuole was enumerated for 100 vacuoles or more per experiment. This assay showed that the distribution of vacuole sizes was similar across all three strains (parental, ∆<italic>ppm5c</italic>, and <italic>ppm5c</italic>.cp) at all time points tested (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). This indicates that PPM5C is not needed for efficient division of the parasite.</p><p id="Par14">We next focused on parasite entry into and exit from host cells. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> egress is dependent on calcium fluxes and can be induced by various chemicals such as the calcium ionophore A23187<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, zaprinast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, and DTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Neither did we detect differences in egress efficiency with 500 µM or 50 µM zaprinast, and 1 µM or 5 µM DTT (data not shown). Next, we explored the ability of all three strains to enter host cells and establish parasitophorous vacuoles. Briefly, the same number of parasites of each strain were added to host cell monolayers and allowed to invade for 30 minutes before removal of free extracellular parasites. After 24 hours of incubation, at which time points parasites remain within the initial parasitophorous vacuole, cultures were fixed, and the number of parasite vacuoles were counted (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). The number of vacuoles formed by ∆<italic>ppm5c</italic> parasites was approximately 40% less than those formed by either the parental or complemented strains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). This result suggests that the propagation phenotype observed with the <italic>∆ppm5c</italic> parasites is likely due to a defect in one of the steps involved in parasite entry into the host cell.</p><p id="Par15">To more precisely analyze the effects of PPM5C disruption on invasion, parasites were allowed to invade for just 30 minutes. After washing off unattached parasites, cultures were fixed and processed with a differential staining method that distinguishes parasites that are outside the host cell from those that are inside<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The ratio of parasites that are inside over the total number of parasites in the culture (both inside and outside) represents the percentage of parasites that have invaded cells once attached. Comparison of this ratio across the three strains shows equivalent efficiency to invade host cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that although the same number of parasites of each strain was used in this assay, the total number of parasites detected was consistently 20–25% less for ∆<italic>ppm5c</italic> than either the parental or complemented strains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). As ∆<italic>ppm5c</italic> parasites can invade normally once attached (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>) the reduction in number of parasites in relation to the other two strains indicates a defect in attachment.

As expected, PPM5C G2A C4A did not localize to the membrane (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>). Importantly, while expression of PPM5C complemented the plaquing and attachment phenotypes observed in the <italic>∆ppm5c</italic> strain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), mislocalized PPM5C G2A C4A was unable to complement either the plaquing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>) or the attachment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>) phenotypes. The inability to complement these phenotypes is not due to differences in protein levels as the mutant and wildtype PPM5C expressed at similar levels based on western blot analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). We also used the same complementation approach to test whether the role of PPM5C in host cell attachment relies on its phosphatase activity.

A key step in any invasion process is the recognition of and attachment to the cell to be infected. While for many pathogens host-cell attachment is driven by contact with specific host receptors, attachment by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> appears to involve ubiquitous host factors, which is consistent with its ability to infect almost any nucleated cell. It is proposed that the initial contact between <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and its host cell is mediated by the interaction of parasite glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored surface antigens (SAGs) and sulfated proteoglycans on the host cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. This initial attachment is followed by secretion of adhesion proteins that establish a tight interaction between the parasite and its host cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The secretion itself and the activity of some of the components of adhesion and invasion machinery are known to be tightly regulated by reversible phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Through the work described here, we have determined that PPM5C, a PP2C family protein phosphatase, is required for efficient host cell attachment by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. PPM5C is localized to the plasma membrane of the parasite possibly via lipid-anchoring served by myristoylation and palmitoylation. Complete knockout of PPM5C disrupts normal propagation of the parasite and specifically affects attachment to human cells. Importantly, we have shown that localization to the membrane and phosphatase activity are required for its function during attachment.</p><p id="Par23">Disruption of attachment by either genetic or pharmacological manipulation is usually achieved by disrupting the secretion of adhesin proteins from specialized organelles known as the micronemes. Interestingly, we did not note any generalized microneme secretion defect in the PPM5C knockout strain. It is plausible that micronemal secretion is affected but not detected due to limitation in the sensitivity of our assay and the incomplete nature of the attachment defect. Nonetheless, there is precedent for attachment defects to be independent of microneme secretion. Calcineurin, a PPP family protein phosphatase is required for both <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> to strongly attach to host cells before entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Knock down of the calcineurin catalytic subunit in both <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> significantly reduced the ability of the parasites to attach to host cells, but microneme secretion levels were not influenced. Similar to what we observed with knockout of PPM5C, disruption of calcineurin does not impact any other steps of the lytic cycle other than host cell attachment. How calcineurin affects attachment at the mechanistic level and the identity of its substrates, have not been resolved. Nevertheless, our results indicate that a second phosphatase, PPM5C, influences host cell attachment independently of microneme secretion.</p><p id="Par24">Transmembrane micronemal proteins, such as MIC2, MIC6, and MIC12, spanning across parasite plasma membrane with extracellular domain interact with host cell receptors and intracellular domain interact with proteins that linked to actin filaments, are central for attachment to host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The micronemal protein AMA1, which also spans across parasites plasma membrane, is critical for attachment and invasion and has been shown to be regulated through reversible phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. AMA1, along with the rhoptry proteins RON 2, 4, 5, and 8, form a ring-shaped structure, referred to as the moving junction (MJ), which spans the plasma membranes of the parasite and the host cell and serves a molecular tunnel through which the parasite enters into the host cell propelled by its motility system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. AMA1 uses its extracellular domain to bind to RON2, which is secreted from rhoptries and inserted into the plasma membrane of host cell where it associates with the RON4, 5, 8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The AMA1-RON2 interaction at the moving junction generates an outside-in signal that triggers dephosphorylation of the AMA1 cytosolic tail, which is required for efficient host cell invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is reasonable that the phosphorylation status of the intracellular domains of the proteins central to host cell attachment, such as AMA1, MIC2, MIC6, and MIC12, play significant roles in maximizing parasite’s attachment. Interestingly, we have identified MIC6 as a potential PPM5C interactor in both our BAR and IP analysis.</p><p id="Par25">Our phosphoproteomic analysis, however, did not reveal phosphorylation sites on proteins predicted to play a role in attachment. While our phosphoproteome covers the largest amount of quantified phosphorylation sites in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> so far, the amount of sites we found different between conditions was very small, but consistent. It is certainly possible that we have not investigated a perfect timepoint here, because the reversible phosphorylation involved in the regulation of attachment could happen in the short time scale when the parasites attach to host cells. In addition, other phosphatases could partially complement the phenotype, leading to only a modest effect in the phosphoproteome.</p><p id="Par26">The fact that some of the proteins we identified are signaling enzymes themselves, argues that the defect in attachment of ∆ppm5c parasite may be related to the altered activity of other kinases, rather than being a direct effect. Since complementation of the KO rebalances the network, it appears to be very flexible in its response. Further work is required to identify the exact role of the identified signaling enzymes during host cell attachment. Given that some of the proteins are likely important<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> for growth, untangling their roles in attachment versus other important biological functions will require careful analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Parasite cultures</title><p id="Par27"><italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites were cultured in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air atmosphere.
