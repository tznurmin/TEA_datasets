The plant belongs to the monocotyledonous family comprising 37 species of <italic>Musa</italic> and seven species of Enset. Most fungal disease research has focused on the commercial cultivars. Enset is an orphan species and the crop is mostly cultivated for food purposes in southern part of Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The edible part of Enset i.e. corm and pseudo stem provide a highly carbohydrate-rich staple or co-staple food, that feed the one fourth of Ethiopian population from south and south-western part of Ethiopia. The crop is known to tolerate extended drought periods, flooding and various diseases. Because of its drought tolerance, Enset is regarded as a priority crop in Ethiopia, where it makes a major contribution to the food safety of the country. Enset is used as staple food and is usually less influenced by the persistent drought periods that occur in Ethiopia. Comestible parts of Enset plant are pulverized and fermented into a starch-rich product called kocho. Kocho is mainly consumed after making pancake-like bread. The corm can be harvested at almost any stage of the crop, and cooked and consumed in the same way with other root and tuber crops, relieving hunger during periods of critical food shortages. Kocho can be stored for a long time (for 10 years and even more) without being spoiled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Enset crop is suitable for sustainable agricultural systems due to its contribution to soil fertility. Reducing soil fertility is one of the major constraints causing yield reduction in Ethiopia. However, Enset has been harvested so intensively during droughts that some important clones have become extinct; there by reducing the genetic diversity of the crop. The crop represents 65% of the total crop production from southern regions of Ethiopia. <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> which is known to be originated in Ethiopia is mainly cultivated under the shade of Enset plants in Gedeo zone of southern Ethiopia, in order to achieve more yields of coffee beans and to protect the plants from environmental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Productivity is very high compared to other crops but varies depending on edaphic factors, altitude, cultural practices and varietal differences. An integrated and comprehensive study of the biological, agricultural, ecological, social, and economic components that make up Enset based agricultural systems is needed in order to boost productivity and permit the distribution of Enset products to non- Enset growing regions of Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Endophytic microorganisms are those which inhabit the internal part of plants, causing apparently no visible changes to their hosts. They play specific roles for plants like, protecting the host-plants against insects and diseases. Some endophytic microorganisms can produce valuable pharmaceutical substances of biotechnological interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This includes symptomless latent pathogens and those fungi which also have an epiphytic stances phase of their life cycle. These microorganisms (mostly fungi and bacteria) mainly reside in host plant for all or part of their life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Endophytes are ubiquitous in the plant world, no report of a plant species not associated to them is known. In addition, in a given plant species individuals without endophytes are rare. Endophytes are known to affect the interactions of plants with their environment and to alter the course of their interactions with plant pathogens. In addition to represent a source of organisms for disease control and plant improvement, the study of endophytes may have an important influence in the conceptual framework where plant-pathogen interactions are interpreted and investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The association between plants and endophytes has been long-established (&gt; 400 million years); Krings et al.<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] found evidence of colonization by three different endophytes in the ancient Rhynie chert plant (<italic>Nothia aphylla)</italic> in Scotland. Extensive research has demonstrated that fungal endophytes are universal throughout all ecosystems and plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On a large scale, endophytic diversity and occurrence are dependent upon biogeography; Arnold and Lutzoni [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] not only found diversity to be greater at the equator than at the poles apparently also observed occurrence to be distinct among bio-geographic regions (i.e., arctic, temperate or tropical). At a more local scale, environmental conditions such as water availability, temperature, agro-ecosystems and plant chemicals can influence diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Also co-evolution with a host may affect endophytic presence and diversity.</p><p id="Par29">Over time, some pathogenic fungi evolve to form benign or mutalistic associations with their host. Benefits such as herb ivory defense or enhanced competitive abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] afforded to a host may result in increased dominance of a specific endophyte conferring those benefits. Furthermore, some endophytic species (e.g., <italic>Neotyphodium</italic>) that confer benefits to a host can also limit colonization of other endophytes via mechanisms such as chemical production. Host genotype can affect endophyte richness, diversity and composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Endophyte communities within spotted knapweed from its native and introduced ranges differed significantly; a specific haplotype of <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> was dominant in plants from the native range while <italic>Alternaria tenuissima, Cladosporium herbarum</italic> and an <italic>Epicoccum</italic> sp. were the most relatively abundant endophyte. Studies on EF community residing in banana plants were extensively studied by various authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, role of EF from different agro-ecosystems in Enset (false banana) is yet to be revealed in details.</p><p id="Par30">Therefore, the aim of the proposed study is to investigate whether Enset agro-ecosystem from Gedeo zone exhibit EF diversity and endophytic community associated within this area. To accomplish this task we have performed richness diversity, colonization rate of EF, fungal community resides in <italic>Ensete ventricosum</italic> leaves collected from different regions. This work is the primary approach to determine the EF diversity in the Enset for the first time. The results of the proposed work is highlighted and discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Description of the study area</title><p id="Par31">Gedeo zone is situated in South Nation Nationality and People Regional State (SNNPRS) of Ethiopia.

For characterization of the morphology of fungal isolates and identification of morpho species, the following seven morphological characteristics were used as criteria to separate and categorize. Identification was based on morphological uniqueness such as growth pattern, color of colony and medium, margin character, surface texture, colony appearance, mycelium color and structure, type of anamorph, conidiomata, conidia and conidiophore morphology (size, color, shape, ornamentation, etc.), conidiogenous cells and characteristics of the spore.

It has been demonstrated that EF can profoundly influence different aspects of plant patho-physiology and actively participate in bio-mechanisms by which plant growth and regeneration is controlled. Thus, understanding the structure of endophyte assemblages is required for further approaches in order to improve the agro-economic status of the Enset production and to find novel applications of these microorganisms and their metabolites in horticultural, or even for medicinal purpose. Results achieved by the present study were applied for an analytical assessment to explicate the composition of EF assemblages on Enset plants in Ethiopia. Biodiversity of EF associated with host plant and structure of endophyte communities are dynamically convertible depending on plant physiology, environmental stresses, their interplay with other parasitic or pathogenic microorganisms and bio-geographical factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Endophytes also tend to be host-specific that can change the prevalence of endophytic taxa in a particular plant genus between different species. As well, divergent endophyte composition may be harbored in host organs due to the histological differences and availability of nutrients by which endophyte colonization is conducted in a tissue-specific manner within a distinctive host species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Along with temporal changes in the niche where both host plant and endophyte inhabit, host species and harboring tissue are consequently the most important factors modulating endophyte diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Various classical protocols have been developed for studying any substratum or group of fungi, and are described in detail by various researchers and are easily available as published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, the present study was conducted with defined methodology so that it could be applied to obtain such data and infer a comprehensive view about composition of fungal endophyte communities associated with Enset plants.</p><p id="Par47">In this study, a total number of 108 EF were isolated that are assigned to 17 morpho-genera or 26 morphological species (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Results of our study is supported by Arnold et al.<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], who suggest that diversity of EF strongly influenced by the traits of ecological environment and geographical location. EF are generally ubiquitous in all plant species studied and <italic>Ensete ventericosum</italic> plants were not known to harbor any EF. Results of our study reported that <italic>Ensete ventericosum</italic> plants had a huge number of endophytic fungal associations. Presence of EF reveals prevalence in plant tissues under taken for investigation. However, in this study the richness in diversity of EF was found among Enset varieties. During course of study, fungal endophytes were isolated at definite conditions using specific and general media for fungal growth. The fungal endophytes that were successfully sub-cultured were identified using morphological characterization.</p><p id="Par48">Three Enset varieties were studied for the composition of EF were principally isolated from young and old leaves of each Enset varieties in the area. It was found that the number of EF isolated from Enset varieties of the area increased with the age of the plants, with 85 isolates being obtained from old leaves of three Enset varieties and 23 isolates were recorded in young leaves of three Enset varieties. This variation of number of isolates may be due to the impact of leafs age dependent production of biochemical metabolites (in amount and type) variation and nutrient composition in leaf of Enset varieties of the area. Since, production of biochemical metabolites (in amount and type) variation and nutrient composition directly or indirectly govern existence and survival of EF the host plant. For example, genera of isolates like <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp<italic>.</italic> and <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp<italic>.</italic> were totally depend on aged leaf of Enset plants. This could have been due to a lack of essential and insufficient nutrients were reported for EF by Pimentel et al.<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] showed that some of the essential nutrients needed by such fungi and in sufficient amount were unavailable during the young stage of Soybean leaves.

This result are in the line of the study of Arnold and Herre, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] who reported that age of the leaves increase from young to mature diversity and richness of endophytic mycobiota increases within the plant. Because mature leaves may have supported higher endophytic abundance may be, due to their higher biomass providing more sites and resources for colonization when compared to young leaves. Likewise leaf exposure time may also have accounted for increased density of EF due to horizontally transition and accumulated over leaf lifetimes.</p><p id="Par50">Arnold and Herre, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were also found that the number of isolates decreased with increasing age of the plants. One of several possibilities were explained by Garcia et al.<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] are since pruned height of young trees is lower, so that the first branch will be closer to the reservoir of inocula present in the previous year’s litter, and therefore fungi may spread relatively rapidly towards the upper third of the canopy. The other reason could be due to a lack of essential nutrients; those essential nutrients needed by EF were unavailable during the maturation and senescence of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Such kind of phenomenon was not observed in our proposed study. Possible reason may be young Enset leaves may not produced essential nutrients that have potential to support the growth of certain EF. As such, high number of EF was isolated from old leaves in comparison to young Enset leaves.</p><p id="Par51">According to the report variation of their diversity could be obtained by abiotic variations on the sites of host plants which govern differences in abiotic factors or local sources of spores. The other factor could be interactions between the endophytes themselves. It is known that endophytes produce an array of metabolites that are active against other microbes. For example, an endophytic fungus inhibits growth of pathogenic fungi within the host plant. The other few species of EF inhabit and isolated from three varieties of Enset plants. For instance, <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp., <italic>Acermonium</italic> sp. and <italic>Acremonium murorum</italic> were isolated only from Boza Enset variety, where as <italic>Epicoccum nigrum, Phoma exigua, Boehravia diffusa, Aspergillus oryzae and Penicillium coffeae</italic> were isolated from both Maziya and Boza Enset varieties and many more as highlighted in (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These groups of endophytic fungal community might be belong to the class of fungi which involved in the decomposition of plant litter, related to known saprotrophic fungi and unidentified relatives have previously been detected in soil and decaying plant material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Similar results were also mentioned in the study of Persoh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] showed that, the ‘latent decomposers’ are not randomly distributed among host plants instead they are host specific species.</p><p id="Par52">Large number of dissimilarity was observed among Enset varieties and different agro-ecological sites with an exception of comparison of MD with BK and MK, MK with BD, BW and AW which has very least percentage of dissimilarity. However, majority of the result according to this parameter, we found dissimilarities in the EF colonization among varieties and different sites studied (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Those results suggest that agro-forestry system may influence the assemblage of EF of Enset plants among the varieties and different sites studied. Previous studies on the composition EF of herbaceous cultivable plants, such as cotton and maize, have shown no similarities in EF communities based on farming practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, our results are in agreement with Pancher et al., (2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] who reported dissimilarity in EF colonization isolated from <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> under various vineyard management practices. Similar results were also published by Saucedo-Garcia et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] as they reports the dissimilarity in the composition of EF from different agro-ecosystems of <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> L. in two regions of Veracruz, Mexico. These indicate that the plantation management techniques in agro-forestry systems of southern Ethiopia, such as coffee plantation and Enset, might influence the assemblage of EF composition. More sampling in future will help to elucidate the factors that influence the EF colonization, but as shown in this report, some of those factors might be the geographical location and agro-forestry system of the Enset plantations has potential to assemblage of EF among Enset leaves.</p><p id="Par53">A comparison of the Shannon diversity index for fungal communities of young and old leaves showed the highest diversity in the old leaves, followed by young leaves. There were significant differences in the diversity of fungal communities among different leaves of Enset (one-way ANOVA, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0004). The diversity indices of EF species associated with Enset leaves are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The Margalef index can reflect the richness of EF species. Result of our study showed that Margalef index was found to be highest for young leaves than that of old leaves. Larger the values of Margalef, the richer the species of EF are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, in our study no larger Margaleaf values were observed and no significant differences in the Margaleaf indices were recorded for young and old leaves. Thus, it can be suggest that no richest species of EF are present in Enset leaves. The species diversity can be analyzed by the Shannon index and Simpson diversity index. These indices are taken into account for the heterogeneity/homogeneity of the species frequencies. Generally, higher the Shannon’s diversity index (commonly ranging between 1.5 and 4.5) and the closer the Simpson’s diversity index to 1, the more intensified heritable variation and stronger adaptive capacity for micro-environmental change the EF communities as they tended to expand the distribution range and enter new environments. As such in our study no heritable variation and stronger adaptive capacity for micro-environmental change in the EF communities can be assumed as the values of Shannon’s diversity index does not range between 1.5 and 4.5 and Simpson’s diversity index was not approach to 1. The Dominance index was used to evaluate the ecological dominance of a community. If a higher Dominance index is observed in the community, it indicates that the community might have low species diversity and evenness. However, in our study no higher values of Dominance index were observed suggest that community might have high species of diversity and evenness. Given the small number of samples (9 Enset plants), it is hard to estimate the total number of endophytic diversity of each individual. More sampling from different parts of Enset growing region will help to elucidate the factors that influence the EF diversity in future.</p><p id="Par54">The findings of the present study show that the Enset agro-forestry system produces potential variability in the colonization, richness diversity, and composition of EF in Enset plants. The results of the proposed studies provide an opportunity to understand the potential use of some EF as producers of relevant products in the management of different pests and pathogens of Enset as well as coffee where, coffee is cultivated under the shade of Enset plant which is widely practiced in Gedeo zone of southern Ethiopia., to discover new drugs with novel antifungal activities, and to understand the potential role of EF as leading controls of pest-population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par55">Isolation, characterization and distribution of the EF from Enset plant is the first study that has been conducted in the developing country like Ethiopia. The result of the present study shows that the Enset agro-forestry system produces potential variability in the colonization, richness diversity and composition of EF in Enset plants. The present study also indicate that the Enset agro-forestry system produces variation in assemblage of EF in Enset plants and may enhance the composition of EF in coffee plants especially in Gedeo zone, where coffee is planted under the shade of Enset plant. Another study from our lab demonstrated that coffee plants grown under the shade of Enset plants are more colonized by EF in comparison to un-shaded coffee plants (unpublished data). Thus, Enset plants have a potential role in colonization of coffee plants and provide protection mechanism against common coffee pathogens around Gedeo zone. In addition, it demonstrated that the region in which Enset is cultivated plays a vital role that influences these parameters. The assemblage of EF in healthy tissues of Enset plants may indicate that some of the fungi are possible latent pathogens and some may become saprophytic. More studies by the use of molecular and physiological tools to identify, individually and collectively, the functional and ecological significance of EF in Enset plants under diverse ecological and geographical conditions will be very significant.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are thankful to the Head, Department of Biology, College of Natural and Computational Sciences, Dilla University, Dilla for his kind support.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors contribution</title><p>NMC is responsible for study concept, designing and coordinating the research and supervising the work.
