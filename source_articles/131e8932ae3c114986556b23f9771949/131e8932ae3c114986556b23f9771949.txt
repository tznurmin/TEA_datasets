Background Apple ($i$Malus × domestica$/i$) is an important fruit crop that is commonly grown worldwide. The gloss and smoothness on apple are important traits that determine the market value of apple, as disease-free shiny fruits are more attractive to consumers. Cuticular wax is responsible for resistance to apple pathogens and gloss. The plant cuticular structure is composed of two parts based on physical location: the cutin, which is close to the cell wall, and the epicuticular wax, which is exposed to the air. An epicuticular film of wax crystals covers the plant surface [ 1 ]. Cuticular wax plays crucial roles protecting against external environmental stress, such as acting as a transpiration barrier and functioning in interactions with pathogens. The basic constituents of plant cuticular wax are very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives. The cuticular synthetic pathway can be divided into three reactions: (1) de novo synthesis of C16 and C18 fatty acids; (2) extension of VLCFAs: the C16 and C18 fatty acids produced during the first stage extend on the endoplasmic reticulum to form C20–C36 VLCFAs; and (3) synthesis of derivatives of VLCFA, such as aldehydes, alcohols, alkanes, ketones, and esters [ 2 ]. The function of epicuticular wax as a transpiration barrier has been widely investigated. In maize, removing the wax layer on the surface of wild maize promotes the formation of adherent cells of rust on the leaf surface [ 3 ]. In addition, the epidermal wax on the surface of the leaf can be used to defend against natural enemies [ 4 ]. Some lipids may act as signaling substances during cell apoptosis and defend against external invasion [ 5 ]. MYB TFs are common among all eukaryotes; however, this protein family is particularly large in higher plants. The MYB protein family in animals contains three MYB conserved domain repeats (R1, R2, and R3), whereas most plant MYB TFs belong to the R2R3 type, which are associated with growth regulatory processes [ 6 ]. MYB proteins are reportedly related to a series of functions regulating secondary metabolism, such as epidermal wax [ 5 ], morphogenesis [ 7 ], and the abiotic and biotic stress responses [ 8 , 9 ]. The functions of the MYB family members have been widely studied. Overexpressing $i$MYB94$/i$ increases total wax load approximately two-fold in Arabidopsis leaves, as $i$MYB94$/i$ binds to the promoters of wax-related genes to enhance their expression [ 10 ]. Programmed cell death is a hypersensitive response that is closely related to plant disease resistance. $i$AtMYB30$/i$ is an active modulator of cell death in both avirulent and virulent pathogen attack responses [ 11 ]. MYB30, MYB55, and MYB110 are three MYB proteins that are transcriptionally induced by microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) treatment, which enhance resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens and have important roles in rice plant immunity [ 12 ]. Furthermore, $i$AtMYB30$/i$ shows great response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibits root cell elongation. This process involves multiple genes associated with VLCFA transport; thus, providing a molecular link between ROS - root cell - wax biosynthesis - plant immune responses [ 13 ]. The cuticle of fruit crops supplies morphological support for the integrity of the entire fruit and also affects growth and maturation [ 14 ]. The composition and content of cuticular wax may lead to differences in quality characteristics, such as post-harvest resistance to water loss, pathogen infection, and cracked fruit [ 15 – 17 ]. A large number of studies on fruit wax have concentrated on wax morphology and biosynthesis, whereas little is known about the molecular pathways regulating wax biosynthesis and their roles in apple. Here, we identified an apple R2R3 MYB TF named $i$MdMYB30$/i$. Furthermore, ectopically expressing $i$MdMYB30$/i$ improved disease resistance by changing the composition and surface properties of the wax. These results demonstrate that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ positively regulates wax biosynthesis and acts as a pathogen resistance mechanism. Results Identification of the $i$MYB30$/i$ gene in apple To separate the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ gene, the $i$AtMYB30$/i$ gene was used as bait to search sequences in apple based on homologous retrieval. We chose a gene with the highest homology to AtMYB30, and named it MdMYB30 (MDP0000149102). The $i$MdMYB30$/i$ cDNA contained two noncoding regions (Additional file  1 : Figure S1), and the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ORF encoded a 342 amino acid polypeptide as predicted by DNAMAN 6.0 software [ 18 ]. We analyzed the amino acid sequences of MdMYB30 and AtMYB30. Figure  1 a shows that the MdMYB30 and AtMYB30 protein sequences were highly similar and contained conserved R2R3 domains. Fig. 1 Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of MdMYB30. a Alignment of the MdMYB30 and AtMYB30 amino acid sequences. The locations of two conserved motifs are labeled with red lines.

The results indicated that apple MdMYB30 exhibited the closest evolutionary relationship with pear PbMYB30 (XP_009376268), because they were in the same clade. MdMYB30 had the most distant relationship with maize ZmMYB30 (XP_008652703.1), wheat TaMYB30 (AYK27536.1), and rice OsMYB30 (BAT05602.1), as all three are monocotyledonous plants. The phylogenetic tree indicated a clear boundary between dicotyledons and monocotyledons. MdMYB30 is localized in the nucleus and is induced by abiotic stress The localization of a protein is very important for its function. Figure  2 a indicates that the green fluorescent signal and the blue fluorescent signal merged in the nucleus, demonstrating that MdMYB30 localized to the nucleus. The $i$MdMYB30$/i$ transcription analysis in various apple tissues showed that although it was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues, the expression levels were different, indicating the specific function of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ in its highly expressed tissues (Fig.  2 b).

Data are mean ± SD of three independent replicates. Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences at $i$P$/i$ &lt; 0.05 To begin to investigate the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ stress response, $i$cis-$/i$elements in the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ promoter were generated by applying PlantCARE software [ 19 ]. A number of regulatory sequences in the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ promoter were identified, including elements involved in heat, low-temperature, and drought stressors, elements involved in plants, such as SA, ABA, and GA, and several light-responsive elements (Table  1 ), suggesting that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ is closely related to plant response to various abiotic stresses.

In vitro-propagated apple seedlings were used for this experiment. The $i$MdMYB30$/i$ transcript level increased rapidly peaking at 0.5-h, and then gradually declined in the PEG treatment. $i$MdMYB30$/i$ expression did not change during the early stage in response to ABA, but increased sharply after 12-h of treatment and reached its maximum at 48-h. No changes in the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ transcript levels were detected after the GA and NaCl treatments. $i$MdMYB30$/i$ functions in biotic and abiotic stress We transformed $i$MdMYB30$/i$ into wild-type Arabidopsis to investigate the role of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ during stress. Six independent $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopically expressing ($i$MdMYB30$/i$ OE) Arabidopsis lines as determined by qPCR were obtained. $i$MdMYB30$/i$ OE4, OE5, and OE6 with higher $i$MdMYB30$/i$ transcription levels were selected for subsequent experiments (Fig.  3 a). We monitored the flg22-induced immune response, PEG-induced osmotic stress, and ABA sensitivity of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ to ectopic expression in Arabidopsis. No clear differences were detected between WT and $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression Arabidopsis in normal MS medium. $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression roots were longer under the flg22 or PEG treatment than those in WT. However, the growth of roots in $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression was significantly inhibited under ABA treatment, compared to the WT. The change in root elongation was more obvious with the increase of flg22, PEG, and ABA concentrations (Fig.  3 b, c). Fresh weight and chlorophyll in the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression lines improved significantly after the flg22 and PEG treatments, whereas they decreased with the ABA treatment, compared to the WT, indicating that ectopic expression of the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ lines increased resistance to biotic stress, osmotic stress, and improved sensitivity to ABA (Fig.  3 c-e). Therefore, these data suggest that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ participates in the response to biotic and abiotic stress.

Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences at $i$P$/i$ &lt; 0.05 $i$MdMYB30$/i$ alters epicuticular wax load and composition Previous studies have demonstrated that $i$AtMYB30$/i$ is an important regulator of wax biosynthesis in Arabidopsis [ 20 ]. Total wax of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression and WT Arabidopsis was extracted to study the function of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ in wax accumulation. A significant difference was found in the total wax load between ectopically expressing $i$MdMYB30$/i$ and WT Arabidopsis. The total wax load was 1.5- to 1.3-fold higher in the stems and leaves of the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ OE lines compared to WT plants (Fig.  4 a; Additional file  1 : Figure S2a; Additional file  1 : Table S1). Then, GC-MS was applied to determine the stem wax components. The analysis of cuticular wax composition showed that the contents of alkanes, alcohols, aldehydes, fatty acids, ketones, and esters increased in the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression lines compared with the WT. Among them, the increase in fatty acids was the largest, which was more than 2.6-fold higher (Fig.  4 b; Additional file  1 : Table S2). C29 alkanes, C31 alcohols, C29 aldehydes, C16 fatty acids, C29 ketones, and C29 and C30 esters increased significantly in the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression lines compared with those in the WT, providing evidence that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ plays an important role in cuticular wax biosynthesis (Additional file  1 : Figure S2b). Fig. 4 Changes in wax load, composition, cuticle wax crystal morphology, and expression of wax-related genes in WT and $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression plants. a Total cuticular wax content of stems, calculated per unit area of 6-week-old Arabidopsis from WT and $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression lines. b Cuticular wax composition of 6-week-old Arabidopsis stems for the WT and $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression lines. c Wax crystal morphology of 6-week-old Arabidopsis stems from the WT and $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression lines detected by scanning electron microscopy (scale bars: 10 μm). The surface of the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression lines were covered with wax crystals and wax deposition, whereas the wild-type surface showed only a small amount of wax deposition (arrows point to the epicuticular wax crystals). Wax crystals were monitored at ×1000/× 25000 magnification (white boxes point to the magnified regions). d The expression of wax-synthesis-related genes in $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression and WT Arabidopsis. e ChIP analysis with nuclei extracted from crosslinked 15-day-old apple calli of the empty vector (EV) and MYB30-GFP OE. The $i$Md18S$/i$ gene was used as a control, which provided the background level for the ChIP samples. P1, P2 and P3 represent putative binding MYB $i$cis$/i$-elements in the $i$MdKCS1$/i$ promoter, respectively. Error bars represent standard deviation (SD; $i$n$/i$ = 3). Data are mean ± SD of three independent replicates. Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences at $i$P$/i$ &lt; 0.05 We examined wax crystal morphology in the stems of $i$MYB30$/i$ ectopically expressing and WT plants, but did not find a difference in wax crystal morphology using SEM; however, the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopically expressing Arabidopsis exhibited more epicuticular wax crystals than the WT (Fig.  4 c). Similarly, the wax crystals in ectopically expressing Arabidopsis leaves were also examined, and just a small increase was detected (Additional file  1 : Figure S2c). Therefore, expression of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ changed the numbers of wax crystals in stems and leaves. Furthermore, the transcription levels of wax biosynthesis genes, including $i$AtHDG1$/i$, $i$AtWRI1$/i$, $i$AtCER3$/i$, $i$AtWIN1$/i$, $i$AtKCS1$/i$, $i$AtACBP1$/i$, $i$AtLACS2$/i$, $i$AtCER1$/i$, $i$AtSHINE2$/i$, and $i$AtSHINE3$/i$ in the WT and $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopically expressed lines were detected by qRT-PCR. Ectopic expression of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ upregulated the transcription of several wax-related genes, such as $i$AtWRI1$/i$, $i$AtWIN1$/i$, $i$AtKCS1$/i$, $i$AtACBP1$/i$, $i$AtLACS2$/i$, $i$AtSHINE2$/i$, and $i$AtSHINE3$/i$, indicating that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ promotes wax biosynthesis (Fig.  4 d). Interestingly, $i$AtKCS1$/i$ was significantly upregulated in $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression plants. Therefore, we analyzed the $i$MdKCS1$/i$ promoter sequence and found three motifs (P1, P2, and P3) that might interact with the MdMYB30 protein (Additional file  1 : Figure S3). The ChIP-PCR assay was carried out to examine if MdMYB30 directly bound to the $i$MdKCS1$/i$ promoter. The results showed that MdMYB30 specifically bound to the TAATTT motif in the P3 sequence of the $i$MdKCS1$/i$ promoter to regulate wax synthesis (Fig.  4 e). $i$MdMYB30$/i$ functions to change epicuticular wax properties and cuticular permeability The thickness of the wax layer is associated with cuticular permeability. The chlorophyll leaching assay was performed to investigate whether cuticular membrane properties in $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopically expressing plants changed. The results indicated that chlorophyll was extracted at a slower rate from $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopically expressing plants compared to WT (Fig.  5 a), suggesting higher cuticular resistance for chlorophyll leaching in the ectopically expressing Arabidopsis. Subsequently, a toluidine blue staining experiment suggested that the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopically expressing lines were more difficult to stain than the WT, regardless of whether rosette leaves or stems were stained (Fig.  5 b, c). These results indicate that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ notably changed the permeability of the cuticular wax.

We assessed whether $i$MdMYB30$/i$ affected resistance to $i$Pst$/i$ DC3000, which is a kind of bacterial pathogen. The results showed that WT leaves exhibited yellowing after 3 days of inoculation with $i$Pst$/i$ DC3000; however, the leaves of the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopically expressing lines showed little yellowing. Susceptibility became more and more serious through time, and almost all WT rosette leaves developed chlorosis after 13 d of infection, whereas the leaves of the ectopically expressed lines were healthier at all time points examined, suggesting that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression conferred resistance to the pathogen (Fig.  6 a). ROS levels are closely associated with a pathogen infection. To test whether the ectopically expressing lines had altered ROS levels after inoculation with $i$Pst$/i$ DC3000 for 5 d, the ROS reactive dyes DAB and NBT were used to test O 2 − and H 2 O 2 contents in infected rosette leaves. The results showed that ectopically expressing $i$MdMYB30$/i$ stained strongly, whereas weak staining was observed in the WT (Fig.  6 c–f). Correspondingly, callose content improved in the ectopically expressing lines after the $i$Pst$/i$ DC3000 infection compared to the WT (Fig.  6 b), demonstrating that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ enhanced resistance to $i$Pst$/i$ DC3000.

At least three biological repetitions were performed $i$MdMYB30$/i$ positively regulates $i$B. dothidea$/i$ attack via transient transformation in apple fruits The expression of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ was increased or repressed using viral vector-based transient transformation to confirm the function of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ in enhancing resistance against pathogens in apple. Here, independent MdMYB30-TRV and MdMYB30-pIR transient expression of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ mRNA levels was downregulated or significantly upregulated, respectively (Fig.  7 a). First, we detected the transcription of wax-related genes at the injection point, and three wax-related genes were positively correlated with $i$MdMYB30$/i$ expression (Fig.  7 b). Furthermore, overexpression of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ accelerated the numbers of wax crystals around the injection sites according to SEM, compared to the control (Fig.  7 c). Correspondingly, overexpression of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ decreased significantly, while its suppression increased the lesions, compared to the empty vector (Fig.  7 d, e). The qRT-PCR results demonstrated that transcription of pathogenesis-related genes, including $i$MdNPR1$/i$, $i$MdPR1$/i$, $i$MdPR5$/i$, $i$MdEDS1$/i$, and $i$MdPAL$/i$ decreased at the TRV-MdMYB30 injection sites and increased at the pIR-MdMYB30 injection sites compared with the controls (Fig.  7 f). Subsequently, the function of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ in disease resistance was confirmed in apple calli. We overexpressed $i$MdMYB30$/i$ in apple calli and obtained three $i$MdMYB30$/i$ overexpressing ($i$MdMYB30$/i$ OX) transgenic lines (Fig.  8 a). Then, we tested the immunity of apple calli to $i$B. dothidea$/i$, and found that overexpressing $i$MdMYB30$/i$ notably reduced the lesions compared to that of the empty vector (Fig.  8 b, c). $i$MdMYB30$/i$ OX transgenic apple calli had higher levels of H 2 O 2 than Empty Vector (Fig.  8 d). These findings demonstrate that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ positively regulates wax accumulation in apple fruit, and strengthened apple resistance to $i$B. dothidea.$/i$ Fig. 7 $i$MdMYB30$/i$ modulates cuticular wax-related resistance to $i$B. dothidea$/i$ in apple fruit. a Expression levels of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ around the injection sites according to qRT-PCR assays.

At least three biological repetitions were performed Discussion Epicuticular wax participates in many physiological processes and is the main protective substance in the aerial parts of plants. MYB TFs participated in numerous processes [ 6 , 21 , 22 ]. Several R2R3 type MYB TFs play essential roles in biological stress through a possible cuticular-dependent pathway [ 23 , 24 ], but the role of R2R3-MYB proteins in disease resistance is poorly understood in apple. Protein subcellular localization is closely related to its function. It was reported that many MYB proteins are localized in the nucleus. In wheat ($i$Triticum aestivum$/i$ L.), $i$TaMYB1$/i$ is localized in the nucleus as indicated by an in vivo subcellular targeting experiment in onion epidermal cells [ 25 ]. In Arabidopsis, $i$MYB21$/i$ and $i$MYB24$/i$ are localized in the nucleus where they interact with $i$MYC2$/i$/$i$3$/i$/$i$4$/i$/$i$5$/i$ proteins to modulate stamen growth and seed production through a bHLH-MYB complex [ 26 ]. The nuclear localized transcription factor MYB2 interacts with bHLH proteins in $i$Apium graveolens$/i$ to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis [ 27 ]. In this study, the MdMYB30 fluorescence signal indicated that it was located in the nucleus, demonstrating that MdMYB30 as a transcription factor (TF) might target the genes localized in the nucleus that are involved in wax synthesis. Plant MYB TFs play important roles in regulatory pathways and networks facing various stressors. In $i$L. purpureus$/i$, $i$LpMYB1$/i$ ectopically expressing Arabidopsis exhibits enhanced drought and salt resistance compared to WT [ 28 ]. In Arabidopsis, AtMYC2 and/or AtMYB2 overexpressing plants show higher sensitivity to ABA and several ABA-inducible genes are upregulated, indicating that both proteins transcriptionally activate the expression of the ABA-inducible gene under drought stress [ 22 ]. In our study, ectopic expression of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ in Arabidopsis improved the responses to abiotic (PEG and ABA) and biotic (flg22 and $i$B. dothidea)$/i$ stressors. Previous studies have shown that cuticular wax is mainly composed of alkanes, alcohols, aldehydes, free acids, ketones, and esters. Among them, alkanes account for 40–60%, alcohols account for 15–20%, aldehydes account for 5–10%, free acids account for 5–9%, ketones account for 15–20%, and esters account for &lt; 10% of wax content. Increased alkane content in Arabidopsis has the greatest impact on total wax quality [ 29 – 31 ]. Our results show that wax content of each component is consistent with previous ones and the most obvious increase in wax content was fatty acids, compared to WT. We suspect that fatty acids may play a role in disease resistance of the plant epidermis. Studies of Arabidopsis long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase2 ($i$LACS2$/i$) mutants have demonstrated that modifications in epidermal wax component, structure, and permeability may result in strong resistance to $i$Botrytis cinerea$/i$ [ 32 ]. An increase in wax content usually causes changes in the crystalline structure and quantity of wax crystals [ 33 , 34 ]. Here, epidermal wax load and the number of wax crystals increased in $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression Arabidopsis, which was possibly due to altered epidermal wax composition. Previous reports indicate that the $i$AtKCS1$/i$, $i$AtFDH$/i$, and $i$AtDH3$/i$ genes are involved in VLCFA biosynthetic pathways. MYB30 directly activates the promoters of these genes to modulate cell death by increasing the biosynthesis of VLCFAs in the endoplasmic reticulum [ 5 ]. Transcription of the cuticular wax-related gene MYB96 was induced by drought and ABA and specifically bound to the promoter regions of several structural genes associated with wax biosynthesis$i$.$/i$ The increased wax content subsequently leads to enhanced drought tolerance in plants [ 35 ]. Our results demonstrate that enzyme-encoding genes and TFs increased significantly in $i$MdMYB30$/i$ ectopic expression Arabidopsis compared to WT. Among them, $i$AtKCS1$/i$ was the most obvious, which is consistent with $i$MdMYB30$/i$ binding to the $i$MdKCS1$/i$ promoter$i$,$/i$ thereby activating its expression. As toluidine blue directly enters plant tissues without a solvent, this method can be used to study permeability of the cuticular membrane [ 32 ]. We used the toluidine blue staining assay to determine epidermal wax permeability. A previous study showed that $i$Vicia faba$/i$ leaves infected with bean yellow mosaic virus exhibit higher H 2 O 2 and MDA levels compared to controls [ 36 ]. Here, the $i$MdMYB30$/i$ transgenic apple calli and ectopically expressing Arabidopsis leaves exhibited more O 2 − and H 2 O 2 contents than the WT after treatment with $i$Pst$/i$ DC3000 and $i$B. dothidea$/i$ for 4 days, respectively. Actually, a burst of ROS is considered one of the earliest responses to a biotic stress [ 37 ]. The ROS burst enhances plant disease resistance and increases changes in the cell walls [ 38 ]. These findings support previous views and confirm that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ positively regulates plant disease resistance. Conclusions In conclusion, we present evidence that $i$MdMYB30$/i$ improved plant disease resistance and we propose a working model to explain this process (Fig.  9 ). Briefly, the TF $i$MdMYB30$/i$ regulates the biosynthesis of cuticular wax by activating the expression of $i$MdKCS1$/i$. Thus, ectopically expressing $i$MdMYB30$/i$ significantly increased the total amount of cuticular wax and changed its composition; therefore, changing the surface properties and pathogenesis-related genes to resist against pathogens. Fig. 9 A model of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ regulated wax-related pathogen resistance Methods Plant materials and growth conditions ‘Orin’ apple calli (wild type) were cultured in the dark at 23–25 °C and subcultured every 3 weeks. The ‘Royal Gala’ tissue culture seedlings were cultured at 23–25 °C under a 16 h/8 h photoperiod and subcultured once per month. The subcultured mediums used were followed by [ 39 ]. Arabidopsis (ecotype ‘Columbia’) were grown in a long-day (16 h/8 h) light incubator at 19–22 °C. Tobacco ($i$Nicotiana benthamiana$/i$) was grown at 23–25 °C under 14 h/10 h photoperiod. Individual apple tissues were taken from 5-year-old ‘Royal Gala’ trees for the tissue expression experiments. The apple seedling treatment method for the stress response experiments followed that described previously [ 40 ]. The apple fruits were sampled 140 days after blooming from ‘Golden Delicious’ trees. $i$B. dothidea$/i$ was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 24 °C [ 41 ]. ‘Orin’ apple calli was given by Prof. Takaya Moriguchi of the National Institute of Fruit Tree Science, Japan. ‘Royal Gala’ trees were obtained from the experimental station of Shandong Agricultural University. ‘Golden Delicious’ fruits were obtained from a commercial orchard near Tai-An City. We declare that the collection of plant materials comply with institutional, national, or international guidelines. Phylogenetic tree construction and amino-acid sequence analysis The homologs of Arabidopsis MYB30 were obtained from the Protein BLAST program ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ ). The phylogenetic tree and multiple sequence alignments were made using MEGA 7.0 and DNAMAN 6.0 software, respectively. MEME Suite ( http://meme-suite.org/ ) software was used to obtain the functional motifs of the MYB30S. The MdMYB30 protein structural domain was predicted through NCBI website ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi ). Plasmid construction and plant genetic transformation Leaves of ‘Royal Gala’ tissue-cultured seedlings were used to extract RNA to clone MdMYB30 cDNA. The 1026 bp MdMYB30 cDNA was amplified using the MdMYB30-PRI-F (5′-GTCGACATGGGGAGGCCTCCTTGCT-3′) and MdMYB30-PRI-R (5′-GGATCC GAAAAAGTTAGCATTTCCATGATCT-3′) primers, designed with the SalI and BamHI restriction endonuclease sites, respectively. To obtain the MdMYB30-GFP fusion protein, the amplification product was inserted into PRI-GFP. Transformations of apple calli and Arabidopsis followed the methods described in [ 42 , 43 ], respectively. Subcellular localization The full length MdMYB30 sequence was inserted into the GFP vector to construct the recombinant plasmid MdMYB30-GFP. 35S::MdMYB30-GFP, which was used to transform tobacco [ 44 ]. The fluorescent signals were detected using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 META, Jena, Germany). Wax extraction, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Cuticular wax was extracted exhaustively using the following steps: chloroform extraction, nitrogen blow drying, derivatization reaction, and sample analysis following that described previously [ 39 , 45 ]. SEM was performed as described previously [ 39 ]. The steps can be summarized as: sampling, vacuum freeze drying, gold spray treatment, observation of the mirror. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis The ChIP-PCR analysis was performed using the EpiTect ChIP OneDay Kit following the method described by [ 46 ]. The primers used in the ChIP-PCR analysis are listed in Additional file  1 : Table S3. Gene expression analysis Plant total RNAs were isolated using the RNA plant Plus Reagent Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Reverse transcription was performed using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with the gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). The quantitative RT-PCR assay was carried out using the Step One Plus™ Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to examine the transcription level of the wax and disease resistance-related genes. The qRT-PCR was performed according to [ 47 ]. The primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Additional file  1 : Table S3. Chlorophyll leaching assay The rosettes from 4-week-old seedlings were sampled. Chlorophyll content was determined following methods described previously [ 48 , 49 ]. Toluidine blue staining Toluidine blue staining was performed to detect leaf surface permeability, and carried out according to [ 45 ]. Pathogen infection assays Leaves of WT and transgenic Arabidopsis were sampled and infected as described previously [ 50 ]. The Arabidopsis infection analysis with the bacterial strain $i$Pseudomonas syringae$/i$ pv tomato DC3000 ($i$Pst$/i$ DC3000) was carried out as described by [ 51 ]. $i$Pst$/i$ DC3000 is a model bacterial strain for the interaction between Arabidopsis and pathogenic bacteria. The inoculation of apple calli with $i$B. dothidea$/i$ was performed according to [ 50 ]. ROS assays H 2 O 2 was quantified according to the method described by [ 52 ]. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining methods were applied to determine O 2 − and H 2 O 2 levels, respectively [ 50 , 53 ]. Callose staining Four days after infecting with $i$Pst$/i$ DC3000, the leaves were rinsed 20 h in fixative solution (formaldehyde: acetic acid: ethanol: H 2 O, 3.7%: 5%: 50%: 41.3%, by vol.). The sample was removed from the fixative and soaked with 8 M NaOH for 5–6 h; the NaOH was removed and the sample was washed with deionized water for 10 min; the water was removed, and 0.01% (w/v) aniline blue dye solution was added in the dark for 1 h. The quantitative statistics of the callose deposits was carried out using ImageJ software as described previously [ 50 ]. Construction of the viral vectors and agroinfiltration of apple fruit Viral vectors were used as described by [ 54 ]. The primer pairs MdMYB30-F (5′-ATGGGGAGGCCTCCTTGCT-3′)/−R (5′- GAAAAAGTTAGCATTTCCATGATCT-3′) were used to amplify the full-length MdMYB30, which was inserted into the pIR vector to generate the pIR-MdMYB30 construct (Additional file  1 : Table S3). Then, a portion of the full-length cDNA of $i$MdMYB30$/i$ (15–348 bp) was cloned and inserted into the tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vector in an antisense orientation to obtain the antisense construct TRV-MdMYB30. The instant injection method was used as described by [ 55 ]. After the injection, the fruit was placed in the dark for 3 days at room temperature, after which $i$Botryosphaeria dothidea$/i$ was inoculated at the injection point with an inoculating loop, placed in the dark at room temperature under humid conditions, and the proliferation of $i$B. dothidea$/i$ was observed after 3 days. Statistical analysis Each experiment was set up with three times repetitions and the data are based on the results of three parallel experiments. The data were analyzed for significance using Data Processing System (DPS) ( http://www.chinadps.net/ ). Tukey’s single factor test was used. All datasets were analyzed in the same way. A $i$p$/i$-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.
