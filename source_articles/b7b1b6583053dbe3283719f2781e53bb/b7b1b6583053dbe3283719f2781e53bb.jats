In addition, CDM treatment contributes to protect cells from virus cytopathic effect and causes a strong inhibition of HSV-2 titer.

A mouse vaginal model of HSV-2 infection has been developed by several investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although the degree of pathogenicity of the virus for mice is dependent on the virus strain used, in general, experimental infection by vaginal route (i.v) results in neurological disease, which is preceded by easily recognizable symptoms due to inflammation followed by rear leg paralysis and death. This mouse model provides a useful tool to test the effect of antivirals against HSV-2 infection.</p><p>Many studies have been performed in our laboratory with an antiviral compound isolated from the leaves of <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> L. named meliacine (MA). We have shown that meliacine strongly inhibited the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in Vero cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and exhibits a synergistic antiviral activity when combined with acyclovir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Studies performed by Alché <italic>et al</italic> suggested that MA exerts the antiviral action on both synthesis of viral DNA and maturation and progress of HSV-1 on Vero cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have shown that meliacine prevents the development of HSV-1 stromal keratitis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Likewise, the severity of the herpetic infection in female mice infected intravaginally with HSV-2 was also ameliorated by MA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, besides its broad effect of antiviral action, meliacine acts as an immunomodulator in vitro agent inhibiting the phagocytosis of opsonized sheep erythrocytes and impairing the proliferation of spleen and lymph node T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, meliacine is a weak inducer of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in murine macrophage cultures and causes a synergistic effect on the production of TNF-α induced by LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Vaginal washes of female mice infected i.v. with HSV-2 and treated with meliacine contained an increased amount of TNF-α in comparison with infected non-treated animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>IFN response represents an early host defense event, one that occurs prior to the onset of the immune response. In this context, macrophages play a central role in resistance of mice to primary infection with HSV-2, mainly, as a source of antiviral cytokines, TNF-α, IFN α/β and IL-12, which are produced rapidly after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. IFN-γ, a strong activator of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] is produced both in the early stages of infection by natural killer cells and at later stages by activated T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The innate immune response to viral infection depends on the integrity of this network of cytokines, which is tightly regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This <italic>in vivo</italic> situation led us to query whether the administration of meliacine to HSV-2 infected mice could altered the homoestasis of IFNs host response either affecting the antiviral activity of IFN α/β or IFN-γ, or their synergizing interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To answer that question we conducted experiments following an indirect approach based on the observation that IFN-γ synergizes with IFN α/β to inhibit HSV-1 replication in Vero cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To that end, Vero cells infected with HSV-2 were treated with IFN-α, IFN-γ or a combination of both in the presence or absence of meliacine under different experimental conditions.</p><p>To perform these experiments instead of meliacine, we worked with the compound 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM) which is the molecule responsible for the broad spectrum of meliacine antiviral action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In summary, here we analyzed: <italic>i)</italic> the susceptibility of HSV-2 to IFN-α, IFN-γ or the combination of both in Vero cells since no published data is available with this herpesvirus; <italic>ii)</italic> the effect of CDM on interferons action.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Antiviral effect of IFN-α, IFN-γ and IFNs combination on HSV-2 plaque formation</title><p>Since there is no published data on the effect of IFNs on HSV-2 infection in Vero cells the capacity of human IFN-α and/or IFN-γ to inhibit the replication of HSV-2 strains MS and G was initially performed in a plaque reduction assay. The concentration of IFN-α and IFN-γ used in the present experiment were those previously tested against HSV-1 (KOS strain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Vero cells were pretreated for 16 hours with 100 IU/ml of IFNs separately or in combination and infected with HSV-2 (MS or G strain) at the MOI of 1 PFU per cell. HSV-1 (KOS and F strains) were also tested using the same MOI and served as controls. The efficiency of HSV-1 strains KOS and F plaque formation was quite modestly reduced by the presence of IFN-α or IFN-γ alone. Whereas, the combination of IFN-α and IFN-γ acted synergistically as previously reported for HSV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Simultaneous treatment of Vero cells with both IFN-α and IFN-γ reduced HSV-2 plaque formation 3.8 fold for MS strain and 8.6 fold for G strain in comparison with the effect of each IFN alone (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Likewise HSV-1, the level of inhibition achieved with IFN-α and IFN-γ combination treatment was not a consequence of doubling the amount of IFN per culture. As seen in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, increasing the concentration of each IFN to 200 IU/ml did not augment the inhibitory effect.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effect of IFN-α and IFN-γ on HSV-2 and HSV-1 plaque formation on Vero cells.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left"><p>Treatment (IU/ml)<sup>a</sup></p></th><th align="center"><p>Mean no. of plaques<sup>b</sup> ± SEM</p></th><th align="center"><p>Fold reduction<sup>c</sup></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>HSV-2 MS</p></td><td align="left"><p>Vehicle</p></td><td align="center"><p>137 ± 8.3</p></td><td align="center"><p>-</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>82.5 ± 6.4</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.7</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-γ (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>86 ± 6.6</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.6</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (100)+IFN-γ (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>36.5 ± 4.3</p></td><td align="center"><p><bold>3.8</bold></p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (200)</p></td><td align="center"><p>68 ± 5.8</p></td><td align="center"><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-γ (200)</p></td><td align="center"><p>72 ± 6</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.9</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>HSV-2 G</p></td><td align="left"><p>Vehicle</p></td><td align="center"><p>98.5 ± 7</p></td><td align="center"><p>-</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>81 ± 6.4</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.2</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-γ (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>98 ± 7</p></td><td align="center"><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (100) + IFN-γ (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>11.5 ± 2.4</p></td><td align="center"><p><bold>8.6</bold></p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (200)</p></td><td align="center"><p>52 ± 5.1</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.9</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-γ (200)</p></td><td align="center"><p>35 ± 4.2</p></td><td align="center"><p>2.8</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>HSV-1 KOS</p></td><td align="left"><p>Vehicle</p></td><td align="center"><p>133 ± 8.2</p></td><td align="center"><p>-</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>68.5 ± 5.9</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.9</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-γ (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>74.5 ± 6.1</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.8</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (100) + IFN-γ (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>4 ± 1.4</p></td><td align="center"><p><bold>33</bold></p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (200)</p></td><td align="center"><p>54.5 ± 5.2</p></td><td align="center"><p>2.4</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-γ (200)</p></td><td align="center"><p>84.5 ± 6.5</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.6</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>HSV-1 F</p></td><td align="left"><p>Vehicle</p></td><td align="center"><p>100 ± 7.1</p></td><td align="center"><p>-</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>82.5 ± 6.4</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.2</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-γ (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>84.5 ± 6.5</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.2</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (100) + IFN-γ (100)</p></td><td align="center"><p>19 ± 3.1</p></td><td align="center"><p><bold>5.3</bold></p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-α (200)</p></td><td align="center"><p>51.5 ± 5.1</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.9</p></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><p>IFN-γ (200)</p></td><td align="center"><p>53 ± 5.1</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.9</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Vero cells were treated continuously with IFN-α, IFN-γ or combinations of these cytokines from 16 h before infection until the end of the experiment.</p><p><sup>b</sup> Average number of plaques per well of Vero cells inoculated with 200 PFU of HSV-1 KOS and F and HSV-2 MS and G.

Vero cells were pretreated for 16 h with 100 IU/ml of IFNs separately or in combination. Then, cells were infected with HSV-2 (MS or G strain) at the MOI of 1 PFU per cell and culture supernatants were harvested at 24, 48 and 72 h p.i. and titered for infectious virus. For control purpose HSV-1 strains KOS and F similarly treated were included. In accordance with the results presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, we observed a greater inhibitory effect on HSV-2 replication when Vero cultures were treated with IFNs combination than IFN-α or IFN-γ alone, despite that each interferon showed a greater antiviral activity than in plaque reduction assay (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In cultures treated with 100 IU/ml of IFN-α or IFN-γ, MS and G replication was 8-fold and 100-fold reduced respectively (p &lt; 0.001) at 24 h p.i. (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). At 48 and 72 h p.i. viral titers in IFN-α or IFN-γ-treated cultures approached levels of those detected in vehicle-treated groups. However, relative to vehicle control cultures, viral titers recovered at 48 and 72 h from cultures treated with IFN-α or IFN-γ were reduced by 2-fold in MS-infected cultures and 2-and 3-fold in G infected cultures respectively (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). In HSV-2 infected cultures treated with combination of IFN-α and IFN-γ the inhibitory effect was different between strains. Titers of HSV-2 MS were reduced 100-fold approximately relative to vehicle treated Vero cells at all time point tested. In the case of HSV-2 G, IFN combination virus titers were reduced 10.000-fold in comparison to control cultures at 24 h p.i. At 48 and 72 h p.i. the antiviral activity decreased, however virus replication was still 2000-fold inhibited. These results indicate that the combination of IFN-α and IFN-γ synergizes the antiviral effect against HSV-2 in a similar mode to previously reported for HSV-1 (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effect of IFN-α and IFN-γ on HSV replication.

In comparison with vehicle treated uninfected cells, IFN treatment did not affect cell morphology or proliferation. (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Infection with HSV-2 MS strain destroyed 87.5% of vehicle-treated cells by 48 h p.i. (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Treatment with IFN-α or IFN-γ delayed the onset of CPE in MS-infected cultures and increased the fraction of viable cells recovered between 24 and 36 h p.i. (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). However, at 48 h p.i. the cultures appeared like vehicle treated cells. By contrast, a combination of IFN-α and IFN-γ provided the greatest protection, 75% of MS-infected cells remained viable at 48 h p.i.

First, we tested the effect of CDM on cell CPE protection provided by IFN-α, IFN-γ or the combination of both. For this purpose an experiment similar to that described in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> was performed but in the presence of CDM (50 μg/ml). The number of surviving cells was determined at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h p.i. (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). A comparison of Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> shows that in the presence of CDM alone Vero cells were highly protected from HSV-2 cytopathicity, since 60% of infected cells remained viable. When CDM was combined with IFN-α or IFN-γ, the number of protected cells increased with respect to the effect of each interferon alone suggesting that the protection observed is due to CDM effect. Interestingly, when cells were treated with CDM plus IFN combination there seems to be an additive antiviral effect, a phenomenon that was confirmed by next experiments.</p><p>We also tested if the presence of CDM under different experimental conditions could affect the antiviral action of IFNs on HSV-2 MS replication. Virus yields at 24 h p.i. were determined in Vero cells treated with CDM as follows: <italic>i</italic>) for 2 h prior to interferon induction and then removed, <italic>ii</italic>) added simultaneously with IFN and remained only for 16 h before infection, <italic>iii</italic>) added after virus infection and remained to virus harvest, <italic>iiii</italic>) added with IFN 16 h before infection, re-added after infection and remained to virus harvest. The results obtained following protocol <italic>i</italic>) are depicted in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. The antiviral effect due to interferon alone or in combination is 2-fold increased in cells pretreated with CDM, as an indication that CDM treatment did not interfere with the antiviral activity displayed by IFN alone or in combination. On the contrary, we can speculate that the antiviral effect of CDM alone contributed in an additive manner to the overall antiviral activity. When CDM was present during the 16 h IFN antiviral induction period, the interpretation of the results are rather complicated because of the antiviral effect of CDM <italic>per se</italic> which reduced HSV-2 replication by 20-fold (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Likewise, in the experiments described in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, there is an additive effect of CDM when cells were treated with both IFN-α or IFN-γ or their combination (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). When CDM was added after virus infection and remained until 24 h p.i. or it was also present during the induction period, the antiviral effect of the compound was so high (100-fold and 20.000-fold reduction virus yield respectively) that masked its interaction with IFNs (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). For that reason, we repeated the experiment shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> with lower concentrations of CDM. Virus yields at 24 h p.i. in cultures treated with 6.12, 12.25, 25 and 50 μg/ml of CDM, or CDM plus 100 IU/ml of IFN-α or CDM plus 100 IU/ml of IFN-γ were determined. As can be seen in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, CDM alone inhibited virus replication in a dose dependent manner. The combination of each IFN with CDM increased in 1 log the antiviral effect but without altering the kinetics of the inhibition observed.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effect of CDM on the antiviral action exerted by IFNs.

However, nearly all the animal viruses evolved mechanisms to antagonize the effect to IFN-induced antiviral state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the case of HSV-1 it was reported that the resistance to IFNα/β is an active process that is dependent on the expression of at least two viral proteins the immediate early protein ICP0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and ICP34.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Expression of ICP0 also plays a role in resistance of HSV-1 to IFN-γ[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Thus explaining why IFNα/β or IFN-γ alone are weak inhibitors of HSV-1 wild type virus replication. Strikingly, recent studies showed that co-activation of IFNα/β and IFN-γ receptors renders cells highly resistant to HSV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This finding is turning to be a general phenomenon since a synergistic antiviral effect of the combination of IFN-α and IFN- γ was also demonstrated for other members of <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and a variety of RNA viruses like SARS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], Lassa virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Considering this background the current investigation was undertaken to determine if IFN combination inhibited in a synergistic manner HSV-2 replication in Vero cells, and if so to determine if the presence of the plant derived antiviral compound CDM could affect the antiviral state induced by IFN-α or IFN-γ or their combination.</p><p>As expected, the results shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, clearly demonstrated that HSV-2 plaque formation, viral replication and the onset of viral CPE in Vero cells are synergistically inhibited by interferon combination. Whereas, individual cytokines were weak inducers of the antiviral response, independently of the concentration tried was 100 or 200 IU (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Importantly, there is no evidence that the two cytokines, individually or collectively, were harmful to uninfected or HSV-2 infected cells at the concentration used (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). To the contrary, the cells remained viable after cytokine exposure for 48 h after the induction period as assessed by MTT exclusion colorimetric method and remained able to proliferate (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) indicating that virus inhibition was the consequence of a blockade in virus replication and no to host cells death. The validity of these findings was provided by the inclusion of HSV-1 KOS and HSV-1 F strains in the experiments as controls. Results depicted in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figures <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref> (KOS), 1d and 1 h (F) showed a synergistic effect of IFN combination on HSV-1 virus replication confirming previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The antiviral effect of CDM in infected cells is due to alterations in cellular processes. Working with VSV as a model system it was demonstrated that CDM exerted its antiviral action on the endocytic and exocytic pathway of VSV by pre- or post-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This effect is a consequence that CDM induced cytoplasmic alkalinization of intracellular endosomes. The refractory state to virus infection reached a maximum after 2 h of pre-treatment and is fully maintained up to 12 h later, however even at 24 h the cells still remain partially resistant to virus infection. Since acidification of vacuolar compartments plays an important role in a variety of cellular processes we wondered where the presence of CDM could inhibit the antiviral state induced by interferon treatment.</p><p>The results presented in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> showed that a concentration of 50 μg/ml of CDM alone or in combination with interferon did not affect uninfected cell viability. Moreover, the presence of CDM, either alone or in combination, for 48 h (Figures <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) contributes to protect cells from virus CPE. So, the results obtained were not perturbed by compounds cytopathicity.</p><p>To test the antiviral action of IFN we used a standard procedure comprising a period of 16 h cell treatment (induction of the antiviral state) previous to virus infection. IFN was then removed during virus adsorption and after that re-added up to virus harvest. The presence of CDM for 2 h before induction, during the 16 h induction period, only for 24 h after infection or during the complete IFN treatment period did not affect IFN action. On the contrary, in the presence of CDM, an enhanced effect of the antiviral action of each interferon alone or in combination (see Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) was observed indicating that alteration of cellular processes occurring in cells after exposure to CDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] did not interfere with the establishment of a refractory stage to HSV-2 infection in cells treated with IFN. It is remarkable that the sensitivity of HSV-2 to CDM increased steadily in accordance with time of cell treatment. Thus, after 2 h pretreatment with CDM virus titer was 2 fold reduced (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) but if pretreatment was extended to 16 h, virus reduction increased 10 times (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). In accordance with previous results obtained with meliacine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], addition of CDM to cells after HSV-2 infection caused a strong inhibition of virus titer in the order of 100 fold (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Unexpectedly, when CDM was present for 16 h before infection and for 24 h afterwards, virus yield was reduced 20.000 times (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). This high antiviral activity of CDM <italic>per se</italic> complicated the interpretation of the results obtained in the presence of IFN (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), which in comparison reduced the amount of virus even in combination less than 2 logs. To overcome this inconvenience, we performed an experiment with lower concentrations of CDM added after virus infection and lasted to virus harvest, in combination with 100 IU/ml of IFN-α or IFN-γ. A clear additive effect of CDM with IFN-α or CDM plus IFN-γ at all concentrations tested was observed (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the results reported here indicated that the presence of CDM did not alter the biological activity of IFN-α or IFN-γ or their combination. As a result we can envision that the administration of CDM <italic>in vivo</italic> could not affect the production of IFNs, which are so important mediators on the innate resistance to HSV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown here that IFN-α, together with IFN-γ synergistically inhibits the replication of HSV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> like it was also demonstrated for HSV-1 and others DNA and RNA viruses.
