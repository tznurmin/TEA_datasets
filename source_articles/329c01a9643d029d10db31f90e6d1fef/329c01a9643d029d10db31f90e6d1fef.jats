Liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells, KCs) and oxidative stress play critical roles in the pathogenesis of toxin-induced liver injury. Here, we evaluated the role of oxidative stress in regulating KC polarization against acetaminophen (APAP)-mediated acute liver injury in a streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic murine model. Compared to the controls, hyperglycemic mice exhibited a significant increase in liver injury and intrahepatic inflammation. KCs obtained from hyperglycemic mice secreted higher levels of the proinflammatory factors, such as TNF-α and IL-6, lower levels of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. Furthermore, enhanced oxidative stress was revealed by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment. In addition, ROS inhibitor NAC resulted in a significant decrease of ROS production in hyperglycemic KCs from mice posttreated with APAP. We also analyzed the role of hyperglycemia in macrophage M1/M2 polarization. Interestingly, we found that hyperglycemia promoted M1 polarization, but inhibited M2 polarization of KCs obtained from APAP-exposed livers, as evidenced by increased MCP-1 and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene induction but decreased Arg-1 and CD206 gene induction accompanied by increased STAT1 activation and decreased STAT6 activation. NAC restored Arg-1, CD206 gene induction, and STAT6 activation. To explore the mechanism how hyperglycemia regulates KCs polarization against APAP-induced acute liver injury, we examined the AMPK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and found decreased AMPK activation and increased AKT activation in liver and KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment. AMPK activation by its agonist AICAR or PI3K inhibition by its antagonist LY294002 inhibited ROS production in KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment and significantly attenuated APAP-induced liver injury in the hyperglycemic mice, compared to the control mice. Our results demonstrated that hyperglycemia exacerbated APAP-induced acute liver injury by promoting liver-resident macrophage proinflammatory response via AMPK/PI3K/AKT-mediated oxidative stress.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, significantly lower protein levels of p-AMPK and higher protein levels of p-AKT were found in liver tissues from hyperglycemic mice posttreated with APAP. Similarly, decreased protein levels of p-AMPK and increased protein levels of p-AKT were also found in KCs from hyperglycemic mice posttreated with APAP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). To further determine the role of PI3K in regulating hyperglycemic KCs ROS production, we employed PI3K antagonist LY294002 in vitro. Indeed, LY294002 effectively inhibited AKT activation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Furthermore, LY294002 significantly inhibited hyperglycemic KCs ROS production posttreated with APAP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d, e</xref>). Afterward, AMPK activator AICAR was utilized to determine the relationship between the AMPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Indeed, AICAR significantly increased protein levels of p-AMPK and decreased protein levels of p-AKT in KCs isolated from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). Moreover, AICAR notably inhibited hyperglycemic KCs ROS production posttreated with APAP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g, h</xref>). Interestingly, in vivo AMPK activation alleviated the traumatic role of hyperglycemia in APAP-induced liver injury, as evidenced by lower serum ALT and AST levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>), decreased liver architecture damage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>), and decreased hepatocellular apoptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d–f</xref>) compared to APAP treatment alone. Finally, we detected KC relative cytokines gene induction in different groups by qRT-PCR. Hyperglycemic livers from APAP mice treated with AICAR showed significantly lower levels of proinflammatory TNF-α and IL-6, but higher levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 gene induction compared to APAP treatment alone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). These results were further confirmed by similar serum TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>).

ROS inhibition by its antagonist NAC effectively suppressed ROS production and inflammatory response of KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment. Furthermore, we hypothesized that AMPK could be associated with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment according to the KEGG database. Therefore, we measured protein levels of p-AMPK, AMPK, p-AKT, and AKT. We found hyperglycemia increased p-AMPK protein expression while decreasing p-AKT protein expression. PI3K inhibition by its antagonist LY294002 or AMPK activation by its agonist AICAR inhibited AKT activation, and subsequently, inhibited ROS production in KCs, leading to ultimately reduced APAP-induced liver injury in the hyperglycemic mice.
