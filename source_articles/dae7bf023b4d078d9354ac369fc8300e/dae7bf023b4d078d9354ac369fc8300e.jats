The production of several thousands of transgenic lines is leading to difficulties in maintaining valuable genetic resources as cryopreservation protocols for eggs and embryos are not yet developed. In this study, we utilized testis cryopreservation (through both slow-rate freezing and vitrification) and spermatogonia transplantation as effective methods for long-term storage and line reconstitution in zebrafish. During freezing, utilization of 1.3 M of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me<sub>2</sub>SO) displayed the highest spermatogonia viability (~60%), while sugar and protein supplementation had no effects. Needle-immersed vitrification also yielded high spermatogonia viability rates (~50%). Both optimal slow-rate freezing and vitrification protocols proved to be reproducible in six tested zebrafish lines after displaying viability rates of &gt;50% in all lines. Both fresh and cryopreserved spermatogonia retained their ability to colonize the recipient gonads after intraperitoneal transplantation of <italic>vasa::egfp</italic> and <italic>actb:yfp</italic> spermatogonia into wild-type AB recipient larvae. Colonization rate was significantly higher in <italic>dnd</italic>-morpholino sterilized recipients than in non-sterilized recipients. Lastly, wild-type recipients produced donor-derived sperm and donor-derived offspring through natural spawning. The method demonstrated in this study can be used for long-term storage of valuable zebrafish genetic resources and for reconstitution of whole zebrafish lines which will greatly improve the current preservation practices.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_50169.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="AuthorContribution"><p>Zoran Marinović and Qian Li contributed equally.</p></notes><notes notes-type="AuthorContribution"><p>Goro Yoshizaki and Ákos Horváth jointly supervised this work.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic> is a well-established, and one of the most widely used vertebrate model organisms in biomedical, developmental and genetic research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> mostly due to its small size, ease of culture, high fecundity, transparent embryos, 70% homology between the zebrafish and human genomes, as well as good annotation of the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. With extensive studies utilizing this model fish, several thousands of transgenic lines of zebrafish have been created by molecular biology tools (such as ZFNs, TALENs, CRISPR/Cas9) during the recent decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, as the molecular methods are improved and refined along with the increasing needs in experimental designs, the number of transgenic lines is only going to increase. This trend is leading to great concerns in the storage and maintenance of these transgenic lines. Current practices are mostly limited only to keeping breeding colonies which requires a significant amount of space, is labor- and cost-demanding, but is also vulnerable to pathogen infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is a great need for improving storage conditions for such valuable genetic resources.</p><p id="Par3">Cryopreservation is a method that allows the storage of genetic resources for an indefinite period of time in liquid nitrogen. Sperm cryopreservation protocols were developed for several hundreds of fish species so far (reviewed by Asturiano <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>). However, there is a great shortcoming of this method since so far only spermatozoa can be successfully cryopreserved in fish, and effective methods for freezing of eggs and embryos have not yet been developed due to their high yolk content and structural complexity. Even though some progress has been made in cryopreservation of zebrafish embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, these methods still do not lead to the production of functional embryos which will be able to reconstitute a whole zebrafish line. Additionally, many protocols for freezing of zebrafish sperm yielded low and very variable post-thaw motility and fertilization rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, thus limiting the applicability of sperm cryopreservation in reconstitution of zebrafish lines. Recently, the study of Matthews <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> standardized the sperm cryopreservation process to a great extent and demonstrated that reliable and reproducible results can be obtained for a large number of transgenic zebrafish lines. However, the absence of methods for conservation of female genetic resources still remains.</p><p id="Par4">Due to the reasons above, we have focused on spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in this study. These are the baseline cells of spermatogenesis with a specific function to both self-renew and differentiate into later-stage germ cells and finally into spermatozoa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Their ability to colonize recipient gonads after intraperitoneal transplantation, proliferate and differentiate into functional gametes (either spermatozoa or eggs depending on the sex of the recipient) after cryopreservation and to produce donor-derived offspring by recipients has been demonstrated by several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Additionally, the study of Seki <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> demonstrated that this approach can be very effective in the conservation of genetic resources and reconstitution of important lines in valuable laboratory animals (medaka <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>).</p><p id="Par5">The surrogate production technology poses several challenges during its implementation. Even though transplanted SSCs have the ability to colonize the recipient gonads, a large number of the autologous germ cells still remain. In fact, the majority of gametes derived from such recipients are autologous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Due to this reason, sterile recipients became imperative, and several strategies were developed. Hybrids between different species or triploid individuals are generally sterile and do not produce gametes, however, their gonads still contain autologous germ cells with which the transplanted cells need to compete. As an alternative, germ cell-deficient fish were produced by knocking down or knocking out the <italic>dead end</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> which is crucial in maintaining the germ cell fate of primordial germ cells (PGCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. An additional challenge of the SSC transplantation strategy is the visualization of donor-derived germ cells within the recipient gonads. To this end, most studies utilized transgenic strains in which <italic>vasa</italic>-positive cells are fluorescently labeled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, therefore enabling the visualization of fluorescently-labelled donor cells within recipient gonads.</p><p id="Par6">As SSC transplantation and surrogate production technology coupled with cryopreservation offer new possibilities in the conservation of valuable genetic resources, in the present study we have successfully developed methods for cryopreservation of zebrafish spermatogonia (through both slow-rate freezing and vitrification) and demonstrated the reproducibility of the presented protocols in several zebrafish lines. Additionally, we have produced functional sperm and viable progeny from cryopreserved spermatogonia trough germ cell transplantation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Optimization of the slow-rate freezing protocol</title><p id="Par7">The viability of spermatogonia frozen with the addition of 1.3 M dimethyl sulfoxide (Me<sub>2</sub>SO) in the cryomedium was significantly higher than the viability of those frozen with other tested cryoprotectants in the same concentration (Tukey’s HSD, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>).

Finally, the addition of different protein fractions as non-permeating cryoprotectants (1.5% BSA, 1.5% FBS, 1.5% skim milk and 10% egg yolk) was assessed.

Recipients of fresh spermatogonia dissected 50 days after transplantation displayed a green fluorescent signal within their gonads indicating that donor cells had the ability to colonize the recipient gonads. Additionally, the large number of fluorescent cells forming colonies within the recipient gonads indicated that the donor cells were able to proliferate inside the recipient gonads (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A–C</xref>). Similarly, frozen and vitrified spermatogonia also retained their migrating ability as they incorporated into the recipient gonads, but also retained their mitotic activity as they also proliferated within the recipient gonads, similarly to the fresh cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B,C</xref>).

The recovered germ cells were physiologically functional since they were able to colonize the recipient gonads, proliferate within them and display production of functional gametes. Lastly, spawning of recipient males with wild-type females produced offspring carrying donor traits thus indicating their donor-derived origin. The protocols developed in this study can be applied to the reconstitution of whole zebrafish lines since testes of donor individuals can be crypreserved for theoretically indefinite periods, and subsequently transplanted into sterile individuals thus producing donor-derived gametes and offspring. Utilization of this technique would greatly alleviate the pressure for storage optimization created by current scientific practices and would offer a new perspective in long-term preservation of valuable zebrafish genetic resources.</p><p id="Par15">Both freezing and vitrification protocols seem to be similarly effective in cryopreservation of zebrafish spermatogonia. Me<sub>2</sub>SO appeared to be superior to other cryoprotectants in freezing of SSCs similarly to the reports of Marinović <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, Linhartova <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, Lee <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Even though higher cryoprotectant concentrations (2–3 M) are more favorable in cyprinid species such as tench<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, goldfish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and common carp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, zebrafish SSCs displayed higher viability at more moderate concentrations (of 1.3 M) similarly to the salmonid species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This indicates that species-specific differences in optimal cryopreservation protocols exist, and that protocols need to be optimized for each species. Sugar and protein supplementation did not enhance the cryopreservation outcome most likely due to a significant amount of sugar and protein already circulating in the blood and extracellular compartments of the testes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, a dose-response study was not conducted for the protein supplementation, nor for particular extender components; therefore refinement of such parameters might further improve the viability rates observed in the present study.</p><p id="Par16">The vitrification methodology used in this study has recently started to attract many cryobiologists as it outperforms freezing in several key aspects: (1) time-effectiveness since the preparation of samples is faster, several samples can be manipulated at the same time, and the cooling itself is radically faster; (2) low volumes of lN<sub>2</sub> needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Needle immersed vitrification (NIV) is especially significant as it allows the manipulation of several tissue pieces at the same time, but also enables a direct contact between the tissue and liquid nitrogen thus increasing the cooling and warming rates as well as reducing the amount and concentration of cryoprotectants needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. On the other hand, compared to the freezing protocols, vitrification does need significantly higher concentrations of cryoprotectants to enable the transition to the glassy amorphous state which in turn may be toxic to the cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Combining two cryoprotectants in similar concentrations enables the use of high overall cryoprotectant concentrations, however, each of them is in low enough amount to avoid toxicity to the cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The protocol using 3 M Me<sub>2</sub>SO and 3 M PG in the VS yielded the highest spermatogonia viability, similarly to the reports of Lujić <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, vitrification displayed one significant advantage over the freezing protocols since far less spermatozoa were observed after vitrification. Most likely, spermatozoa do not survive the vitrification process, get digested during the enzymatic treatment and therefore the suspensions are enriched for spermatogonial stem cells.</p><p id="Par17">Sterilization of the recipients generated an all-male population. Similar was reported by Slanchev <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, Tzung <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, Gross-Thebing <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> where the knockdown or knockout of the <italic>dead end</italic> gene (that is involved in maintaining the germ-line fate of PGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>) also produced all-male zebrafish populations since gonads adopt the testis fate in the absence of germ cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Germ line deficient testes have a normal somatic structure and are capable of supporting gametogenesis if exogenous germ cells are introduced as indicated by this and other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, as such gonads have more available stem cell niches for the transplanted cells, the incorporation rates should be inherently higher in the germ line deficient recipients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Contrary to the study of Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> which did not display such an event, in the present study transplantation into sterilized individuals yielded higher incorporation rates than the transplantation into non-sterilized wild-type individuals. Even though the exact reason for this difference between studies is ambiguous, the possible reason might lie in the methodology used for sterilization; the present study utilized morpholino oligonucleotides to inhibit translation of the <italic>dnd</italic> mRNA for a certain time window during which PGCs migrate, while in the study of Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> the knock out of <italic>dnd</italic> through ZFNs induced a lifetime absence of the gene. As observed by Škugor <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, <italic>dnd</italic>-KD results in several metabolic impairments, predominantly in the sex hormone metabolism. The lifetime absence of <italic>dnd</italic> may indeed have a profound influence on the proliferation and differentiation of incorporated donor cells, hence the very low (~5%) proliferation rate in the study of Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Additionally, these metabolic impairments caused by the absence of <italic>dnd</italic> could be responsible for the unsuccessful hormonal induction into females in <italic>dnd</italic>-KO individuals after several trials, even though sex reversal in <italic>dnd</italic>-KD fish was reported as successful<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Spawning of the recipient fish with wild-type females produced viable offspring demonstrating donor-derived traits. All F1 offspring displayed a green fluorescent signal under the microscope, expression of <italic>yfp</italic> was confirmed with RT-PCR amplification, and most importantly, F1 individuals developed and matured normally. Therefore, we can conclude that the offspring produced by mating of recipient males and wild-type females carried donor-derived traits. One important issue to factor in is that the offspring will be heterozygous for the assessed trait. Therefore, pure homozygous individuals can be obtained only in the F2 generation, where approximately 25% of the F2 offspring will be homozygous for the given trait. This can be circumvented by transplanting spermatogonia into both sterilized and non-sterilized recipients. Spermatogonia have been demonstrated to develop into functional eggs when transplanted into female recipients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, which was also demonstrated in the present study. Therefore, by spawning sterilized recipient males with non-sterilized recipient females, a certain percentage of F1 offspring will be homozygous for the assessed trait. Such fish can then be selected and used for producing the F2 generation which will be 100% homozygous for the given trait. Lastly, hormonal induction of <italic>dnd</italic>-KD sterilized individuals into females needs to be confirmed and tested. Preliminary results obtained by Saito <italic>et al</italic>. (cited from Goto and Saito<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>) display that eggs can be obtained from sterilized zebrafish recipients after hormonal treatment. In such case, the production of 100% donor-derived eggs, and subsequently 100% donor-derived and homozygous offspring would be possible.</p><p id="Par19">The strategy for the preservation of genetic resources developed in this study is complementary to the sperm cryopreservation techniques currently utilized in leading zebrafish line repositories as well as other zebrafish facilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A key difference between the two is that freezing of testes requires sacrificing donor individuals, while sperm cryopreservation enables a long-term utilization of one individual male. Therefore while some individuals can be kept for milt production, several males (or in need even the whole line) can be sacrificed so that the genetic resource can be recovered at a later date. If we take into account that approximately 50% of the SSCs survive the cryopreservation procedure, and that donor SSCs incorporate into 30–50% of the recipient individuals, approximately 10–15 recipients producing donor-derived gametes can be obtained from sacrificing one male. Additionally, even though the application of sperm cryopreservation has been proven in practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, the application of this method only preserves the male germline, therefore, the line needs to be recovered usually from the AB wild-type eggs. In this case, the F1 generation is 100% heterozygous, while in the F2 generation only 25% of the fish are homozygous, thus making recovery of the homozygous lines laborious and expensive. Conversely, the surrogate preservation technique allows for the full homozygous line to be recovered in the F1 generation spawned from the recipients. As described above, if the hormone-induced feminization of <italic>dnd</italic>-KD proves to be successful, 100% of the F1 individuals will be donor-derived and homozygous thus greatly decreasing the labor as well as time needed to produce homozygous individuals from the cryopreserved sperm. As an alternative, cryopreservation of oocytes could be used for conservation of female genetic resources, however, only immature oocytes (especially stage I and II oocytes) display favorable survival and their physiologic activity is very limited as they display lower growth and maturation potential after cryopreservation compared to fresh controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p id="Par20">All experiments performed in Japan were conducted in in accordance to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, while all experiments performed in Hungary were conducted in accordance with the Hungarian Animal Welfare Law, Hungarian Government Directive 40/2013 on Animal Experimentation and the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council.

All spermatozoa were diluted 10 × in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS); sperm numbers were counted under the Burker-Turk type chamber; kinematic properties of stripped spermatozoa were assessed by a Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis software (CASA; SpermVision version 3.7.4, Minitube, Tiefenbach, Germany).</p><p id="Par31">Offspring were produced by naturally mating mature recipient fish with wild-type females. Fertilization rates were calculated 24 hours post fertilization (hpf), while hatching rates were counted 48 hpf. Produced offspring were checked for fluorescent signal under a Leica M205FA fluorescent stereomicroscope 3 days post fertilization (dpf) and six months post-fertilization.

RNA was isolated according to the standard manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was reverse transcribed using the RevertAid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). The PCR amplification of <italic>yfp</italic> cDNA was conducted by using HOT FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR supermix (Solis BioDyne) and the following primers: YFP-forward: 5′-CTCGTGACCACCTTCGGCT-3′; YFP-reverse: 5′-TCCTGGACGTAGCCTTCGG-3′<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

All percentage data were log ratio-transformed prior to statistical analysis. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test was used to test the effects of different cryopreservation parameters on post-thaw viability of spermatogonia. Two-factor ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test was used to assess the effects of different equilibration and vitrification solutions on spermatogonia viability. All statistical analyses were conducted in Statistica 13.1 software (TIBCO software Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the National Research, Development and Innovation Office of Hungary (Grant SNN 116912 to ÁH), EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00008 project co-financed by the EU and the European Social Fund, the Stipendium Hungaricum Scholarship Programme (Grant 106360 to ZM) in Hungary, as well as the Higher Education Institutional Excellence Program (1783-3/2018/FEKUTSRAT) awarded by the Ministry of Human Capacities within the framework of water related research of Szent István University.
