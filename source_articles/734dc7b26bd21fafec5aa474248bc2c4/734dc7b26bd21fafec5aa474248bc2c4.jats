We performed a robust genomic and phenotypic profiling of 53 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> clinical isolates established from diarrheal samples from either intrahospital (IH) or community (CO) populations in central Colombia. <italic>In vitro</italic> tests were conducted to evaluate the cytopathic effect, the minimum inhibitory concentration of ten antimicrobial agents, the sporulation efficiency and the colony forming ability. Eleven different sequence types (STs) were found, the majority present individually in each sample, however in three samples two different STs were isolated. Interestingly, CO patients were infected with STs associated with hypervirulent strains (ST-1 in Clade-2). Three coexistence events (two STs simultaneously detected in the same sample) were observed always involving ST-8 from Clade-1. A total of 2,502 genes were present in 99% of the isolates with 95% of identity or more, it represents a core genome of 28.6% of the 8,735 total genes identified in the set of genomes. A high cytopathic effect was observed for the isolates positive for the two main toxins but negative for binary toxin (TcdA+/TcdB+/CDT− toxin production type), found only in Clade-1. Molecular markers conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones (<italic>cdeA</italic> and <italic>gyrA</italic>) and to sulfonamides (<italic>folP</italic>) were the most frequent in the analyzed genomes. In addition, 15 other markers were found mostly in Clade-2 isolates. These results highlight the regional differences that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> isolates display, being in this case the CO isolates the ones having a greater number of accessory genes and virulence-associated factors.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_47688.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> (CD) is an anaerobic Gram-positive spore-forming bacillus recognized as the causal agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and a wide range of gastrointestinal syndromes, including pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon, that in complex cases can result in death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The impact of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection (CDI) has been well documented in North America, Europe, and some regions of Asia, especially at the intrahospital (IH) level where individuals are exposed to the main risk factors for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> proliferation, among them, antibiotic therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In Latin America, studies focused on determining the frequency of CDI and identifying the hypervirulent strain RT027/BI/NAP1 (belonging to ST-1, Clade 2) have been carried out mainly in Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Chile and Perú<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3"><italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> features two main toxins (ToxA and ToxB), which belong to a large family of clostridial toxins with glucosyltransferase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> that are responsible for the presentation of symptoms caused by damage to the epithelial tissue of the infected host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

Another factor involved in the complexity of CDI management is antibiotic resistance, which has been associated with polymorphisms and/or the presence of genes that can be transported by mobile genetic elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, the ability of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> to sporulate and germinate (aspects that impact on the dissemination and colonization of the microorganism), as well as to present resistance to certain antimicrobials (which affects the response to treatment), contribute significantly to the impact of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> in their hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Whole-genome sequencing of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> is a prerequisite to understand the molecular and genomic basis of the phenotype diversity involved in the wide range of clinical impacts this microorganism can cause.

Although in Colombia typing schemes have been applied to a small number of isolates of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>, these studies have been based on ribotyping and had a purely descriptive approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

These results are aligned with recent reports in which a core genome MLST (cgMLST) scheme was proposed as a useful tool to describe the population structure of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> at the genetic level. The high percentage of genes (71.4%) that were part of the accessory genome and the inconsistencies in the topology of the phylogenetic reconstruction of the concatenated sequences of the accessory genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), which included a change in the relationship between some STs, as well as the high number of accessory and unique genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d–f</xref>) confirmed the dynamic character of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> genome.</p><p id="Par26">Comparisons of the genome sequences of the established isolates with the information available in databases revealed the high frequency with which the isolates obtained at the IH and CO levels transport toxin coding genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). However, the unexpected findings in Clade-2 and the cytotoxic capacity detected after phenotypic tests, revealed that this strategy had limitations in accurately describing the organization of circulating <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> isolates in Colombia. The detection of <italic>toxB</italic>, which leads the pathogenic effect on target cells, was consistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, which indicated its importance for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> colonization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The changes in the organization of <italic>PaLoc</italic> regions that we detected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) corresponded to gain of <italic>tcdE</italic>, which encodes the holine-like protein in Clade-1 genomes initially considered non-toxigenic (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>), and the loss of a region of <italic>tcdA</italic> in Clade-2 genomes, which could affect its detection, indicated that the highly diverse strains circulating in Latin America could escape the diagnostic strategies traditionally used for CD.

In <italic>PaLoc</italic>, the two additional accessory genes to those traditionally reported (<italic>tcdR</italic>, <italic>tcdE</italic>, and <italic>tcdC</italic>) could be involved, although they are currently only recognized as coding hypothetical proteins.

Three of these highly prevalent markers correspond to mutations in constitutive genes (<italic>gyrA</italic>, <italic>folP</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic>), it confirms the ability of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> to modify even constitutive proteins as part of the process of adaptation to hostile environments such as the human intestine, particularly when it has been exposed to antibiotic therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The existence of these four AMR-MMs in all the characterized genomes indicate that this type of modification could be setting as part of the core <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> genome, although it has been historically proposed that they may have been transferred through mobile genetic elements, mainly plasmids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Additionally, besides being the clade with the most genes coding for toxins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), Clade-2 had isolates with the highest number of AMR-MMs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), and this clade also showed reduced susceptibility to a higher number of antimicrobials than Clade-1 isolates. Interestingly, the analyzed isolates obtained from IH environment showed higher number of AMR-MMs than those established from CO population (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). Therefore, these findings could be because of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> adaptation due to exposure to antimicrobial agents that led to selective pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, but the history of antibiotic consumption of the individual patients who provided the samples in this study is unknown and is a limitation of this study.</p><p id="Par29">The identification of at least 38 of the proteins involved in the different phases of sporulation by comparison with the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> 630 reference strain revealed that, in most cases, they shared &gt;98.0% identities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

This protein has been reported as not strictly required for the sporulation or resistance of spores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>; therefore, it may be that the absence of genes occurs when the encoded protein is not essential for sporulation. Interestingly, we identified the stage III sporulation protein AG (CD630_11980), which had two copies in most of the genomes (45 out of 53). This protein, which is encoded in the spoIIIAABCDEFGH operon, under the control of the sigma G factor and expressed during phase 3 of sporulation, has been reported as strictly conserved among species in phylum Firmicutes that form spores (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR014195" ext-link-type="url">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR014195</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par30">When analyzing the sporulation percentage determined during the phenotypic tests (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), we found that, although the results were heterogeneous for Clade-2 isolates, most of the Clade-1 isolates had sporulation percentages &gt;60%, the exception were Gcol.A33, Gcol.A34, Gcol.A54, and Gcol.A55. The genomes of two of these isolates had only a single copy of CD630_11980 and the isolates had the lowest percentage of sporulation (≤32%).</p><p id="Par31">In general, the confirmation of the plasticity of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> genome, the presence of STs with more than one toxigenic profile, the identification of infection events by more than one ST, and the variations found in cytotoxic capacity, sporulation, germination, and profiles of resistance to antibiotics, represent factors at the genomic and phenotypic levels that contribute to the knowledge of circulating <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> characteristics in Colombia. This study presents related limitations with the small sample size and reduced number of isolates, that limit the extrapolation of the data, therefore, future studies should include a larger sample size in order to support the results obtained here.
