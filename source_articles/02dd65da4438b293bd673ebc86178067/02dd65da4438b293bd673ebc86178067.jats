The activity of cathepsins is regulated by their endogenous inhibitors – cystatins. Cathepsins are crucial to antigen processing during viral and bacterial infections, and as such are a prerequisite to antigen presentation in the context of major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules. Due to the involvement of DCs in both innate and adaptive immune responses, and the quest to understand the impact of poxvirus infection on host cells, we investigated the influence of ectromelia virus (ECTV) infection on cathepsin and cystatin levels in murine conventional DCs (cDCs). ECTV is a poxvirus that has evolved many mechanisms to avoid host immune response and is able to replicate productively in DCs.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Our results showed that ECTV-infection of JAWS II DCs and primary murine GM-CSF-derived bone marrow cells down-regulated both mRNA and protein of cathepsin B, L and S, and cystatin B and C, particularly during the later stages of infection. Moreover, the activity of cathepsin B, L and S was confirmed to be diminished especially at later stages of infection in JAWS II cells. Consequently, ECTV-infected DCs had diminished ability to endocytose and process a soluble antigen. Close examination of cellular protein distribution showed that beginning from early stages of infection, the remnants of cathepsin L and cystatin B co-localized and partially co-localized with viral replication centers (viral factories), respectively. Moreover, viral yield increased in cDCs treated with siRNA against cathepsin B, L or S and subsequently infected with ECTV.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Taken together, our results indicate that infection of cDCs with ECTV suppresses cathepsins and cystatins, and alters their cellular distribution which impairs the cDC function. We propose this as an additional viral strategy to escape immune responses, enabling the virus to replicate effectively in infected cells.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par34">Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) found in all epithelial tissues and are strategically located at the sites of pathogen entry. A number of studies have established that DCs are an important link between innate and adaptive immunity because of their capability to innately detect pathogens through receptors such as Toll-like receptors, (TLRs), and also the ability to process and present antigens to lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Adaptive immune responses are initiated by CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes recognition of antigens associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II or class I molecules, respectively, displayed on DCs surface. Therefore, processing of antigens, which occurs in phagosomes/endosomes or the proteasome is an important step before epitope association with MHC molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The major group of enzymes responsible for the degradation of exogenous or endogenous antigens is mostly the protease. Among them, the best known and well characterized are cysteine cathepsins. Cathepsins are essential enzymes involved in protein degradation, and extracellular matrix remodeling in all cell types and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. They are produced as inactive enzymes (zymogenes) within the lysosomes. Cathepsins undergo activation by autocatalysis due to low pH or they are activated by other proteases, such as pepsin and cathepsin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Cysteine cathepsins are present and active in lysosomes, nucleus, cytoplasm and cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, cathepsins are also present in the extracellular space and secretory vesicles of some cells, not only as zymogens, but also as active proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">It appears that besides the role of cysteine cathepsins in antigen processing, they also participate in cell entry of many types of viruses, including Ebola virus (EBOV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and reoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the exact role of cathepsins during poxvirus infection has not yet been adequately investigated.</p><p id="Par37">The mousepox virus (ectromelia virus, ECTV) is a double stranded DNA virus that belongs to <italic>Poxviridae</italic> family of viruses in the genus <italic>Orthopoxvirus,</italic> the same genus that encompasses variola virus (VARV, the causative agent of smallpox) and vaccinia virus (VACV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Infection of mice with ECTV causes symptoms much similar to those observed in people infected with VARV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, infection with ECTV is characterized, in contrast to VACV, by a narrow host range and the course of infection is very similar to that observed in humans infected with VARV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Orthopoxviruses have well-evolved immune evasion strategies to elude and manipulate the host defense mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The activity of cysteine cathepsins is regulated by endogenous protein inhibitors called cystatins. There are three types of cystatins: type 1 cystatins, also called stefins (A and B) are generally located intracellularly; type 2 cystatins: C, D, E/M, F, S, SN and SA are extracellular proteins, and type 3 cystatins – kininogens which are multifunctional plasma proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Beyond regulation of cysteine cathepsins activity cystatins also protect host cells from pathogens that use cysteine proteases for cell entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Our previous studies showed that mRNA and protein level of cathepsin B, L and S was downregulated during infection of murine peritoneal macrophages with the mousepox virus. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of cathepsin B and L in macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 resulted in increased viral yield in supernatants collected 48 h post infection (pi) with ECTV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, Wang and co-authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] indicated that mRNA and protein level of cathepsins B, D and S is reduced in human B cells during VACV infection, which probably alters the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway. However, it is not known if cathepsin expression in conventional DCs (cDCs) is affected during infection with ECTV.</p><p id="Par39">In the present study we asked whether cathepsins are targeted by the replicating ECTV in cDCs in in vitro conditions. For this purpose we used an immortalized immature GM-CSF–dependent DC line JAWS II established from bone marrow cells of p53<sup>−/−</sup> C57BL/6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and primary murine GM-CSF-derived bone marrow (GM-BM) cells (formerly described as bone marrow derived DCs – BMDCs) derived from C57BL/6 mice. The latter cell culture in fact represents a heterogeneous cell population, consisting of DCs and macrophages, what may influence the interpretation of obtained results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. JAWS II cells has been shown to be a convenient substitute for primary BMDCs, however, they may harbor inherent differences resulted from the immortalization process and/or from the p53-deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Having the above considerations in mind, using both cell cultures minimize the risk of misinterpretation or over-interpretation of obtained results. GM-CSF-derived bone marrow cells from in vitro cultures phenotypically and functionally resemble monocyte-derived inflammatory DCs and non-lymphoid tissue DCs, such as interstitial DCs found in vivo in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Our results show profound down-regulation of gene and protein expression for cathepsin B, L and S at 24 hpi with ECTV in JAWS II and GM-BM cells. Similarly, cystatin B and C mRNA and protein levels were markedly reduced in infected cells. Additionally, cathepsin L was found to co-localize with viral factories during the entire replication cycle in both type of cells. Moreover, antigen uptake and processing was impaired in infected JAWS II cells at 12 and 24 hpi and in infected GM-BM cells at 24 hpi. Importantly, we show more efficient replication of ECTV in JAWS II and GM-BM cells with the minimal level of cathepsin B, L or S. These results show that ECTV may impair the function and distribution of cathepsins as well as cystatins in cDCs, accompanied by altered capacity to process an exogenous antigen. This may serve as a viral strategy to escape immune response and presumably enables the virus to replicate effectively in infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>ECTV induces early apoptosis in JAWS II dendritic cells at later stages of infection</title><p id="Par41">ECTV is able to productively infect JAWS II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and GM-BM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] cells. Therefore, in order to eliminate the apoptosis bias in interpreting the gene and protein expression data, we first assessed the apoptotic rate in these cells during the infection with ECTV at multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.5. Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that the percentage of early and late apoptotic cells did not change between ECTV-infected and control JAWS II dendritic cells during the first 12 h of infection. However, at 24 hpi the percentage of early apoptotic cells was significantly (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01) higher in ECTV-infected JAWS II cells compared to uninfected control cells. In our recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] we reported that GM-BM infected with ECTV at MOI = 5 did not show increased apoptosis until 12 hpi, therefore, in the present study (GM-BM infected with ECTV at MOI = 0.5) we evaluated the apoptotic rate only at 24 hpi (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The percentage of early apoptotic cells was slightly, but not significantly (<italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.05) increased in GM-BM infected with ECTV compared to uninfected cells.

In contrast, the level of mRNA expression for cystatin A was undetectable in uninfected and infected cells.

The data suggests that there is no relocation of cathepsin and cystatins e.g., to the nucleus, protein reduction is highly likely to result from reduced mRNA.

We used a soluble antigen DQ-OVA, conjugated with the pH-insensitive fluorescent dye (BODIPY, FL). After endocytosis through the mannose receptor, DQ-OVA is degraded to bright-green fluorescence fragments by the endo-lysosomal proteases. Uninfected JAWS II and GM-BM cells were able to endocytose and degrade the DQ-OVA, as evidenced by the high MFI value for green fluorescence.

To further elaborate on the immune evasion strategies engaged by ECTV, we scrutinized the impact of ECTV infection on selected cathepsins (B, L, S) and cystatins (A, B, C) regarding gene and protein expression in murine JAWS II and GM-BM cells. Selection of the cells to analyze was dictated by the fact that dendritic cells are in the forefront of subsequent immune responses ensuing infection. But to be able to attribute any changes to the viral activity only and not to the virus-induced apoptotic process, we first determined the apoptotic rate in murine JAWS II and GM-BM cells. ECTV infection of JAWS II cells at a low MOI (0.5) induces early apoptosis at 24 h following infection, in contrast to GM-BM cells in which the induction of apoptosis was not detected during the entire virus replication cycle. Therefore, the observation at 12 and 24 hpi in both cells types that expression of cathepsins and cystatins was significantly reduced, and degradation of DQ-OVA was altered, indicates that such inhibitory effects were not caused by the apoptotic process and may strictly be related to the immunomodulatory strategies engaged by the virus. Moreover, ECTV itself encodes a variety of proteins to overcome apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], including EVM025 that inhibits activity of pro-apoptotic Bak and Bax, and stabilizes mitochondrial membrane integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Our results indicated a profound down-regulation of both mRNA and protein expression of cathepsin B, L and S, and cystatins B and C following infection with ECTV both in JAWS II and GM-BM cells, mainly at 24 hpi. It is well documented that poxviruses cause a global shutdown of host mRNA and protein synthesis probably to facilitate their own replication due to deactivation of cellular antiviral response and restriction of competition for the translational machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This phenomenon would explain why both cathepsins and their negative regulator cystatins are downregulated in ECTV-infected cDCs. Interestingly, we observed that the mRNA expression for cathepsin B, S and cystatin C was primarily reduced in JAWS II cells. Moreover, we observed profound down-regulation of gene expression for cathepsin B, S and cystatin B in GM-BM cells. The level of cathepsin L and S protein was greatly reduced in JAWS II cells, while cathepsin S and cystatin C protein expression was primarily reduced in GM-BM cells. These results are consistent with our previous findings that ECTV infection of peritoneal macrophages isolated from ECTV-infected susceptible BALB/c and resistant C57BL/6 mice have decreased mRNA and protein level of cathepsins B, L and S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We were unable to detect expression of cystatin A in cDCs, however, according to Kopitar-Jerala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] cystatin A is present only in the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) that do not internalize, process and present antigens in the context of MHC II. Our findings are in agreement with results obtained by Wang and co-authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], where mRNA and protein expression of cathepsins B, D and S was decreased in B cells during VACV infection. However, cathepsin L gene expression and protein level were enhanced in VACV-infected B cells. The authors have suggested that the reduced level of cathepsins may alter antigen processing and probably contributes to the loss of MHC class II function.</p><p id="Par52">Cathepsins have been shown to play essential roles in antigen processing, suggesting that they are involved in adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For example, studies focused on cathepsin S revealed that this acid-independent lysosomal cysteine protease mediates processing of outer capsid protein σ3 in macrophage-like P388D cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. It is important to note that the role of cysteine cathepsins in APCs, including DCs, is not limited only to antigen processing. Cathepsin B, D and S as well as cystatin C are important enzymes responsible for initiation of removal of the MHC II-associated chaperone invariant chain (li) from MHC II, thus permitting peptide association and intracellular transport of MHC II for display on the APC cell surface. Cathepsin S plays the most important role in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. DCs isolated from cathepsin S-deficient C57BL/6 mice show a dramatically reduced distribution of MHC class II molecules on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Other studies also confirmed that cathepsin S is essential for efficient Ii processing, since in the absence of this protease, Ii degradation was markedly diminished in DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

Moreover, in mice with cathepsin L deletion numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes were reduced in the thymus and periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection markedly decreased DCs maturation and reduced cathepsin S expression and possibly leading to impaired MHC class II maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

For example, cathepsin B inhibition by cystatin C or CA-074Me (synthetic inhibitor) treatment resulted in enhancement of the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection in HeLa and TE671 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Harman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have demonstrated that mRNA and protein expression of cathepsin B, C, S, and Z were profoundly decreased in human monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) after 48 h of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, cathepsin L protein level was increased in cells infected with HIV-1. These studies suggest that the reduction of cathepsin activity possibly impairs late endosomal degradation of HIV-1, resulting in uncontrolled replication of virus in DCs. Moreover, authors hypothesized that reduced function of cathepsins may lead to decrease HIV-1 antigen processing and presentation, and therefore diminish HIV-1–specific stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes to avoid adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Cathepsin B activity in SAOS-2, HeLa, and TE671 cells was responsible for HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 degradation in acidic endosomes, contributing to reduced CD4-independent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Similar to cathepsin B, down-regulation of cathepsin L also promotes replication of some viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

Therefore, in the light of earlier findings by others, our observations suggest that decreased expression of cathepsins and cystatins induced by ECTV in JAWS II and GM-BM cells may serve not only to abrogate antiviral immune response initiated by these cells, but may also provide a more suitable environment for efficient replication in infected cDCs. This statement is supported by our results concerning increased ECTV titer in cDCs after removal of cathepsin B, L or S using siRNA, together with our previous study in which siRNA knock-down of cathepsin B and L in RAW 264.7 macrophages resulted in higher replication of ECTV, compared to infected wild-type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">ECTV-infected JAWS II and GM-BM cells exhibited decreased cystatin B and C expression both at mRNA and protein level. Čeru and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] showed that cystatin B modulates cathepsin L activity in the nucleus, therefore this endogenous inhibitor could play an important role in regulating the proteolytic activity of cathepsin L to protect substrates, such as transcription factors, from proteolytic degradation. Cystatin C regulates cathepsin S activity and Ii processing in DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. During the process, any reduction in cystatin C-cathepsin S ratio may result in a substantial enhancement in active cathepsin S. Studies on cystatin C derived from human seminal plasma using the dot-blot technique revealed that cystatin C interacted with different HIV-1 proteins, such as gp160, gp120, p31, p24 including HIV protease. Importantly, HIV protease function relies on generating mature functional protein components of an infectious HIV virion.

The authors have suggested that decreased cysteine proteases expression, mainly cathepsin S, may be associated with reduced or slow Ii degradation, leading not only to the loss of MHC class II function, but also to efficient transition of virus replication later stages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par59">Our results show a profound down-regulation of cathepsins B, L and S, and cystatins B and C in JAWS II and GM-BM cells, together with diminished ability to endocytose and process a soluble antigen by these cDCs during later stages of ECTV infection. Because this highly suggests impaired cellular function, therefore cDCs may not perform efficiently inducing adaptive immune responses. Higher virus titers in cDCs reported in this paper, together with increased viral yield in macrophages after anti-cathepsin siRNA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], indicate that the virus replicates efficiently during low expression of cathepsin B, L or S. Detailed studies dealing with functions of cathepsins and cystatins in cDCs infected with poxvirus should lead to a better understanding of the poxvirus-host interactions, as this may yield information valuable for the rational design of new vaccines or therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Virus</title><p id="Par60">Highly virulent Moscow strain of ECTV (ECTV-MOS, ATCC VR-1374; Manassas, VA, USA) was used in all experiments.
