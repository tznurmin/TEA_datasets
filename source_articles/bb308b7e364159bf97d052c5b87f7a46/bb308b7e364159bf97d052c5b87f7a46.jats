Since all flaviviruses are antigenically related, they are prone to phenomena of immunological memory (‘original antigenic sin’), which can modulate immune responses in the course of sequential infections and/or vaccinations. In our study, we analyzed the influence of pre-existing YF vaccine-derived immunity on the antibody response to TBE vaccination. By comparing samples from YF pre-vaccinated and flavivirus–naive individuals, we show that YF immunity not only caused a significant impairment of the neutralizing antibody response to TBE vaccination but also a reduction of the specific TBE virus neutralizing activities (NT/ELISA-titer ratios). Our results point to a possible negative effect of pre-existing cross-reactive immunity on the outcome of flavivirus vaccination that may also pertain to other combinations of sequential flavivirus infections and/or vaccinations.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><title>Flavivirus vaccines: Yellow Fever vaccine commits ‘original antigenic sin’</title><p id="Par2">Flaviviruses, such as Yellow Fever (YF) virus and Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, share a certain level of antigenic relatedness, meaning that pre-existing immunity to one flavivirus species can impact the antibody response to a second — a phenomenon known as ‘original antigenic sin’. A team led by Franz X. Heinz at the Medical University of Vienna investigate the impact of pre-vaccination with the YF vaccine (a minimum of one year earlier) on subsequent vaccination against TBE. Overall, YF pre-immunity significantly reduced generation of TBE neutralizing antibodies compared to flavivirus-naive individuals, but there was a striking level of inter-individual variation. Although even the YF-vaccinated individuals produced sufficient TBE neutralizing titers to be considered potentially protective, these findings suggest that the influence of ‘original antigenic sin’ might need to be taken into account for flavivirus vaccination protocols.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41541_2019_Article_133.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedicine, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Medical Microbiology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Virology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Public Health</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Vaccine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Infectious Diseases</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Flaviviruses comprise a number of important human pathogens that are transmitted to their vertebrate hosts either by mosquitoes (yellow fever, dengue, Zika, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses) or by ticks (tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan viruses).

This phenomenon has been referred to as ‘original antigenic sin’ (OAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and is especially relevant in the context of annual infections and vaccinations with drifting and shifting influenza viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Also in the case of flaviviruses, OAS phenomena can play an important role,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> as a result of sequential exposures to flaviviruses that co-circulate in the same geographical regions, global travel-related exposures, and/or immunization with different flavivirus vaccines, which is the topic of the present work.</p><p id="Par4">Several flavivirus vaccines are licensed and commercially available in one or more countries, and others are in clinical development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> The live YF vaccine (based on the attenuated 17 D strain) is one of the most successful vaccines ever produced and in widespread use in YF-endemic areas of Africa and South America as well as in travelers to these areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Two live vaccines are available against Japanese encephalitis (JE) (based on the attenuated SA14-14-2 strain) and a JE-YF chimera,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and recently a tetrameric Den-YF chimeric live vaccine against dengue was licensed in a number of countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> In addition to these live vaccines, inactivated TBE and JE vaccines are in use, which are both based on purified, formalin-inactivated virions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> The induction of antibodies capable of virus neutralization has been described as the major mechanism for conferring long-lasting protection against flavivirus disease and is considered the most important surrogate marker for vaccine-induced protection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Neutralizing antibodies bind to the major viral envelope protein (E) and inhibit the viral entry functions (cell attachment and membrane fusion) that are mediated by this protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">Mature infectious flavivirus particles contain 180 copies of E that are arranged as 90 homodimers in an icosahedral, herringbone-like arrangement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> The overall molecular organization of E is very similar for all flaviviruses, with a C-terminal double membrane-spanning anchor, a so-called stem region and an N-terminal external part consisting of ~80% of the amino acids assembled in three distinct domains, termed DI, DII, and DIII (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). At the amino acid sequence level, however, the E proteins of different flaviviruses diverge substantially (up to 60%), and cross-neutralization by polyclonal immune sera is usually observed only between relatively closely related viruses that have been grouped into serocomplexes based on this criterion (e.g., TBE and Powassan viruses, WN and JE viruses, or the four dengue viruses are part of the same serocomplexes, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies are induced to various degrees in the course of flavivirus infections and can be readily observed in serological assays other than neutralization tests (NT), such as ELISA and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> The most prominent structural element responsible for the induction of antibodies reacting with all flaviviruses is the fusion loop (FL) at the tip of DII (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>), which is highly conserved but largely buried in the dimeric structure of E.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structure of TBE virus E protein and TBE vaccination schedule. <bold>a</bold> Ribbon diagram of the TBE virus E dimer (PDB: 5O6A;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>) in side view and <bold>b</bold> surface representation of TBE virus E dimer (PDB: 1SVB;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>) in top view (lacking the stem and transmembrane domains (TMD)).

In this context, we investigated whether and in which specific way immunity induced by previous YF vaccination had an influence on the antibody response to TBE vaccination. In addition, our study also focused on the degree of variation of antibody specificities in vaccinated individuals. By comparing the antibody responses in flavivirus-naive and YF pre-vaccinated groups, we demonstrate that pre-existing YF vaccine-derived immunity had an overall negative effect on the neutralizing antibody response to TBE vaccination but resulted in the boosting of cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies. Notwithstanding these overall effects, our analyses also demonstrate strong individual deviations from the average antibody patterns observed in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Antibody response to TBE vaccination</title><p id="Par7">Samples were derived from groups of flavivirus-naive and YF-pre-vaccinated individuals who had received TBE vaccination according to a basic vaccination schedule at time points 0, 4, and 24 weeks (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).

However, quantitative differences as found in our analyses may have implications for long-term protection and highlight the need for a comparative assessment of antibody persistence and vaccine efficacy in both flavivirus-naive and pre-immune individuals. Such assessments are especially important for the recommended schedules of revaccination intervals, which are currently five years (three years in the elderly) and do not take into account pre-existing flavivirus immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup></p><p id="Par17">The effects of immunological memory on the antibody response may vary with different combinations of pre-existing immunity and heterologous flavivirus vaccination.

A similar boosting of such antibodies, concomitant with a broadening of the antibody response, was also observed in a TBE vaccination study with YF pre-immune individuals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> in YF vaccinated persons with pre-existing immunity to heterologous flaviviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> as well as in studies of sequential flavivirus infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> The primary target of broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies is the highly conserved fusion loop (FL) at the tip of domain II in E (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). Because of its interdigitation with a hydrophobic pocket provided by the second subunit in the E dimer, the accessibility of this sequence element can be restricted at the surface of mature infectious virions, and this epitope has therefore been referred to as ‘cryptic’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Since neutralization of neither TBE nor YF virus was impaired after removal of the cross-reactive antibody population from post-vaccination plasma samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), it can be assumed that the FL is relatively inaccessible in both viruses.

A key discriminatory element in the YF pre-vaccinated group is the potential of forming immune complexes between pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies and the TBE vaccine antigen. Immune complexes can interact with Fcγ receptors on immune cells and trigger processes that may influence processing and antigen presentation to T cells, trafficking to germinal centers, affinity maturation and selection of B cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> all of which can lead to competition between memory and naive responses. Further mechanisms contributing to an impaired neutralizing antibody response by cross-reactive antibodies may be related to ‘carrier-induced epitopic suppression’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and/or the shielding of epitopes adjacent to the FL that could otherwise give rise to potently neutralizing antibodies.</p><p id="Par20">In addition to feedback mechanisms mediated by pre-existing antibodies, the impaired neutralizing antibody response observed in YF pre-immune TBE vaccinees may also be related to differences in the stimulation of CD4 helper T cells.

Although an excellent correlation between these parameters was found in both groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>), the slope of the regression line was less steep in the YF pre-vaccinated group than in the naive group, consistent with a higher proportion of cross-reactive antibodies reactive in ELISA relative to TBE virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. Since broadly cross-reactive antibodies did not contribute to TBE virus neutralization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), their disproportionate presence can introduce a bias in using ELISA data for measuring vaccine responses. Such a bias would be even more pronounced with hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests, because flavivirus hemagglutination is caused by the exposure of the FL and its interaction with red blood cells under the acidic pH conditions of the assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> Broadly cross-reactive, FL-specific antibodies are therefore most effective inhibitors of flavivirus hemagglutination, explaining the pronounced broadening of HI reactivities observed previously in studies of sequential flavivirus immunization or infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup></p><p id="Par22">Overall, in both of our groups, broadly cross-reactive antibodies did not dominate the antibody response after the last vaccination, making up only 20 to 30 % of the total TBE E-reactive antibodies measured in ELISA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

One possible explanation would be that the amounts of cross-reactive antibodies present in the YF pre-vaccinated group were already sufficiently high to mask the epitope and thus to prevent a further increased boost of cross-reactive antibodies relative to the flavivirus-naive control group. Such a mechanism of ‘epitope masking’ has been proposed (based on modeling studies) in the context of limited boosting of antibodies to conserved epitopes on the stem of the influenza hemagglutinin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup></p><p id="Par24">An especially interesting aspect of our analyses is the strong variability of individual responses observed in both groups, resulting in substantial deviations from the mean ratios of i. broadly cross-reactive to TBE virus-specific antibody titers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and ii. TBE NT titers to TBE ELISA values (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Both parameters reflect variations of the epitope specificities of antibody populations present in individual plasma samples. Since all individuals had been vaccinated with the same vaccine and therefore encountered precisely the same immunogen, this variation may be the result of stochastic processes that operate at different stages of the immune response, including competition of B cells in germinal centers, selection of certain B cells to become long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow and feedback from antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> as well as antagonistic effects caused by CD4 Tfh and Tfr memory T cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup></p><p id="Par25">In addition, human immune responses can be influenced by other factors, including but not restricted to age and sex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Breaking down our groups into individuals older and younger than 50 years, and women and men, did not yield significant differences of TBE NT titers related to these parameters.

After blocking the plates with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 for 30 min at 37 °C, threefold serial dilutions of plasma samples (from 1∶100 to 1:300,000) were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Using these dilutions, endpoints were reached in all instances. Bound antibodies were detected with a goat anti-human IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # 31412, dilution 1:5000). Specific antibodies were quantified using a flavivirus IgG-positive human serum as an internal standard, arbitrarily defined to contain 1000 IgG Units. The serum was derived from a vaccinated individual and had a TBE NT<sub>50</sub> titer of 7245, and the ratio of the two parameters was within the range observed with the samples analyzed in our study. Since the standard was included on each plate of the assays, this approach allowed controlling plate-to-plate variation and thus further improved reproducibility compared to titer determinations. Curve fitting was performed with Prism version 7 (GraphPad Software Inc.). In each test, the cut-off was defined as the means plus three standard deviations of values obtained with a panel of 8 flavivirus-negative human sera.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Reporter virus production</title><p id="Par31">TBE reporter virus particles (RVPs) were produced in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T/17, ATCC) similar to the production of WN or Den RVPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> Briefly, cells were transfected with two plasmids, a WN virus sub-genomic replicon (kindly provided by Ted Pierson; Viral Pathogenesis Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), carrying the Renilla luciferase gene, and an expression plasmid carrying the structural genes of TBE virus. This plasmid was based on the pRLSV40 vector (Promega) in which the Renilla luciferase gene was replaced by the coding sequence for the structural proteins capsid (C), premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) from TBE virus strain Neudoerfl (GenBank accession no. U27495). The two plasmids were transfected at a ratio of 1:3 with Lipofectamin LTX Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Four hours after transfection, cells were washed and further incubated for 48 h in low-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) buffered with 25 mM HEPES (Gibco).

Triplicates of 2-fold dilution series of individual or pooled plasma samples (starting at 1:20) were incubated with an equal volume of RVPs for 1 hour at 37 °C (the lowest plasma dilution tested was therefore 1:40).Then 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells were added to each well and incubation was continued for 48 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was measured using the Renilla-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instruction in a 1420 Luminescence Counter (Perkin Elmer).
