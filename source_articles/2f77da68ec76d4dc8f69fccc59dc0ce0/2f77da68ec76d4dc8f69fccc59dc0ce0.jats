Due to the expense of PRP kits, and the volumes obtained, freezing aliquots for future dosing is common. Aliquots of PRP are also commonly frozen for later analysis of growth factor concentrations in in vitro research. A variety of freezing methods are used and storage duration until analysis is often not reported. The optimal frozen storage conditions and duration to maintain concentrations of commonly measured growth factors and enzymes in PRP are unknown. Our objectives were two-fold. First, to determine the effect of a single freeze-thaw cycle on PRP protein concentrations and establish their baseline levels. Second, to evaluate the effect of storage in -20 °C automatic defrost freezer, − 20 °C manual defrost freezer, − 80 °C manual defrost freezer, and liquid nitrogen for 1, 3, and 6 months on PRP protein concentrations, compared to the established baseline concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Fold-change between fresh activated and snap frozen PRP were analyzed using paired t-test. A snap frozen-thaw cycle resulted in increased MMP-9 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0021), and a small significant decrease in TGF-β1 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0162), while IGF-1 and PDGF-BB were unchanged compared to fresh activated PRP.

For clinical applications equine PRP can be stored at -80 °C for 1 month or in liquid nitrogen for 6 months to maintain PDGF-BB and TGF-β1 concentration, but IGF-1 concentrations will be reduced. The storage temperature and duration should be reported in studies measuring protein concentrations in PRP. To accurately measure IGF-1 concentrations, PRP samples should be analyzed immediately.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Horse</kwd><kwd>Platelet rich-plasma</kwd><kwd>Storage</kwd><kwd>Freezing</kwd><kwd>Growth factor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Florida</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">N/A</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12917_2019_Article_2040.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine &amp; Public Health</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Veterinary Medicine/Veterinary Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Zoology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Transgenics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2040-4" ext-link-type="doi">https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2040-4</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par17">Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a regenerative therapy prepared from blood that contains increased concentrations of platelets compared to whole blood. In the horse, PRP has been used for over a decade for treatment of musculoskeletal injury and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While much focus is on the platelets in PRP, it is also comprised of plasma, white blood cells (WBC), and red blood cells (RBC). Ultimately, it is the proteins contained within the respective constituents that exert PRPs biologic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor (TGF), are known to have chemotactic, mitogenic, and matrix synthesis effects in tissues. Inflammatory mediators and catabolic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are also present in PRP and correlate with WBC concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Validating PRP for various indications has been challenging due to wide variability in preparation and delivery. While many questions remain, studies in horses have evaluated the composition of PRP generated by a variety of systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the effect of platelet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and WBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] concentration on tendon explants, and the effect of various activators on growth factor release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many of the beneficial growth factors in PRP are sequestered in platelet alpha granules, and platelet activation or lysis is required for their release. While freezing and thawing PRP has been used as a method for growth factor release in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], PRP may also be frozen for later clinical use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Preparation of PRP using manufactured kits is expensive and often yields more PRP than is needed for a single treatment. In addition, there is recent increasing interest in autologous or pooled allogenic platelet lysates to replace fetal bovine serum (FBS) in cell culture for clinical treatment of horses to eliminate the immunogenic effects of FBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For these reasons the practice of freezing PRP is common in both veterinary and human sports medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">While there are anecdotal references to frozen storage of PRP, and growth factor concentrations in frozen-thawed PRP have been measured, there have been no studies comparing growth factor concentrations in fresh PRP and frozen PRP stored for an extended period of time. Furthermore, throughout the literature it is frequently reported that PRP samples are collected and stored in various temperatures, such as − 20 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], − 30 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] -80 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and − 82 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Further, the duration of frozen storage from the time of collection until analysis is not typically reported. The consequences of such storage practices without validation for the substances being measured is that the results reported may be inaccurate due to artifactual changes during storage.</p><p id="Par20">The first objective of this study was to determine the effect of a single snap freeze-thaw cycle and activation (LN0) on TGF-β1, PDGF-BB, IGF-1, and MMP-9 concentrations in equine PRP compared to fresh activated PRP (PRP0). The second objective was to evaluate the effect of storage for 1, 3, and 6 months within 4 different freezing conditions on the same proteins as in objective 1. The storage methods included in the study were a -20 °C automatic defrost freezer (− 20A), a -20 °C manual defrost freezer (− 20 M), a -80 °C manual defrost freezer (− 80 M), and liquid nitrogen (LN). We hypothesized that the concentration of proteins measured in LN0 would not differ from PRP0. Further, we hypothesize that protein concentrations in PRP stored in -20A would decrease with time while there would be no change in protein concentrations in PRP stored under any other condition for 6 months when compared to PRP0.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hematology</title><p id="Par21">Platelet and WBC concentrations were significantly increased and hematocrit significantly decreased in PRP compared to whole blood, confirming the production of PRP (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Concentrations of TGF-β1 significantly decreased in LN0 compared to PRP0. However, the decrease in TGF- β1 was small and unlikely to be clinically significant; therefore, PRP0 was used to compare 1-, 3-, and 6-month data to. Concentrations of MMP-9 significantly increased in LN0 compared to PRP0. As a result, for MMP-9 only, PRP0 and LN0 were included in statistical analysis to compare 1-, 3- and 6- month data.

We approached this by first investigating the effect of a single snap-freeze thaw cycle on concentrations of 3 commonly measured growth factors (PDGF-BB, TGF-β1, IGF-1) and a catabolic enzyme (MMP-9) in PRP. Our results supported our first hypothesis that a single snap freeze-thaw would not affect protein concentrations for PDGF-BB and IGF-1. While TGF-β1 was significantly decreased in LN0 compared to PRP0, this represented a decrease of &lt; 8% which is unlikely to be a clinically relevant change. The 2.2-fold increase in MMP-9 in LN0 compared to PRP0 did not support our first hypothesis. In retrospect, this result should have been anticipated since MMP-9 is principally found in WBC, and has been shown to correlate with neutrophil concentration in human blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, MMP-9 would be released upon lysis of WBC in frozen-thawed PRP, while much of this enzyme would remain sequestered in WBC in fresh activated PRP.</p><p id="Par30">Our second hypothesis was not supported by the results of this study. We used four different freezing options that would be available to the general practitioner or to referral hospitals. We expected that the frequent cyclical temperature changes in a standard household automatic defrost freezer would lead to greater protein loss due to denaturation, and that protein concentrations would remain stable as long as PRP was stored frozen at a consistent temperature. The results of this study showed that the effect of temperature and time in storage differs for each protein. This is the first study to investigate the effect of long-term frozen storage of PRP on protein concentrations without additional manipulation of the PRP. There are established methods for long term stabilization of platelets and the proteins present in PRP using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or sugars such as trehalose and subsequent freeze-drying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These methods were developed for the purpose of platelet transfusion since the shelf-life of platelet concentrates for transfusion is mere days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These techniques are effective and equine freeze-dried platelets have been produced and shown to be biologically comparable to PRP in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the additional platelet stabilization steps for frozen storage are cumbersome, require additional processing and special equipment, and are not practical on a small scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Scant data on the effect of simple freezing on protein concentrations in PRP following short-term storage are available in the scientific literature. Shiga et al. compared concentrations of growth factors from human PRP, including TGF-β1 and PDGF, at the time of preparation and at several time points over 8 weeks, when stored at room temperature, − 80 °C, and freeze-dried [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Similar to our study, all specimens were activated with CaCl<sub>2</sub> and thrombin prior to protein quantitation. The authors reported results that were similar to ours in that PDGF was no different after 4 weeks of storage in -80 °C, but concentrations decreased thereafter. In contrast, their TGF-β1 results differ from ours as concentrations of TGF-β1 decreased at 8 weeks in human PRP, while there was no decrease in TGF-β1 in equine PRP stored at − 80 °C in the present study. Hosnuter et al. determined concentrations of IGF-1, PDGF, and TGF-β1 in human PRP stored up to 14 days at -20 °C and subsequently activated with CaCl<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A decrease in all 3 growth factors was found in the human PRP in this short-term study. While our first storage time-point was later at 1-month, the results of our study were consistent with the results for PDGF and IGF-1, yet TGF-β1 differed once again.</p><p id="Par32">One of the key similarities between our study and the 2 studies described above is that the fresh PRP and the frozen-thawed PRP were activated prior to analysis. Growth factors in platelets are sequestered in platelet alpha-granules and activation is required for their release. Therefore, without activation, fresh PRP would have very low concentrations of growth factors which would be a misleading baseline for comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Previous studies comparing platelet activation using CaCl<sub>2</sub> and thrombin in fresh activated PRP and frozen activated PRP found that 80% of platelets were activated using both methods based on flow cytometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Textor et al. previously reported an inability to quantitate growth factors in PRP following activation with a combination of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and bovine thrombin due to salting out of the growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, we and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] did not encounter this issue.</p><p id="Par33">Aside from the difference in species, the key difference between this study and the 2 short-term studies described above, are that the previous studies only quantitated the growth factor contained in the releasate after clotting. However, it has been shown with a variety of activators that a significant amount of growth factors are sequestered in the fibrin clot that forms following activation of the platelets in PRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our goal was to determine the total amount of growth factor potentially available in the PRP, so we combined the supernatant with the homogenate of the fibrin clot for analysis. It is possible that the polymerization of fibrin is altered after a freeze-thaw and this may in turn alter the distribution of growth factors between the fibrin clot and the releasate. Further work would be needed to determine if this could explain the differences between studies.</p><p id="Par34">The differences in change in concentration of the various proteins measured over time in frozen storage were not expected. Perhaps most surprising, was the significant decrease in IGF-1 by &gt; 58% at all times in all conditions compared to PRP0. Accurately determining the effects of freezing on proteins is technically challenging due to the solidification of the aqueous portion of protein suspensions. The 3 principle mechanisms that degrade proteins in frozen storage are cold denaturation, freeze concentration of solutes (resulting in pH, viscosity, and interface changes), and ice-induced partial unfolding of protein structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The duration of frozen storage, the storage temperature, and the freezing and thawing rate are all important factors that affect stability of frozen proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Unfortunately, the majority of research in this field is limited to the study of proteins in aqueous solutions. One potential explanation for the dramatic decline in IGF-1 with frozen storage compared to the other proteins measured in this study, is that IGF-1 is produced in the liver and is predominantly free in the plasma, while all other proteins evaluated in this study are sequestered within alpha-granules in platelets (PDGF and TGF-β) or within WBC (MMP-9). The cell membrane may protect these proteins from some of the freeze induced changes that degrade IGF-1. Further study of intracellular proteins under freezing conditions would be needed and is beyond the scope of this study. The increase in TGF-β1 after 6 months of storage was also an unexpected result. We verified this result by repeating analysis with new aliquots and reagents (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). It is possible that this result could be due to variations in thrombin activity despite using the same concentration for all samples. Also, one horse had more extreme results that the other horses in the study but did not differ from the mean by greater than 2 standard deviations, and could not justifiably be removed from data analysis. Finally, the TGF-β1 ELISA only measures active protein and an acid activation step is performed prior to analysis. It is possible that a conformation change occurred after 6 months of storage that increased the amount of active TGF-β1 in the sample, although this is less likely.</p><p id="Par35">The principle limitation of this study is that a small subset of the massive number of bioactive factors present in PRP were quantified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Given the protein specific responses to frozen storage of PRP, it is likely that a broader scope of analysis would reveal even more complexity. However, we were limited to the proteins with ELISAs known to be validated for use in the horse. Another limitation is that we only investigated the effect of freezing and frozen storage on total protein concentrations. Further research will be needed to determine the biologic effects of using frozen-thawed PRP compared to fresh PRP in vivo in tissues of interest.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">In conclusion, a single snap freeze-thaw will result in an immediate increase in the amount of catabolic MMP-9 in PRP containing WBC without a clinically relevant change in the concentrations of PDGF, TGF-β1, or IGF-1. Further, PRP is best stored at -80 °C for 1 month, or in LN for up to 6 months for preservation of PDGF and TGF-β1 concentrations. However, if IGF-1 is thought to be an essential growth factor for the intended therapeutic application of PRP, then fresh PRP should be used in these cases. Finally, for research applications, IGF-1 should be measured immediately, while PDGF-BB and TGF-β1 may be quantitated after up to 6 months of storage in liquid nitrogen. The act of freezing itself increases the concentration of MMP-9 and this must be taken into consideration if frozen samples are to be used to quantitate MMP-9 concentrations, which will not accurately reflect the concentrations of MMP-9 applied to tissues or cells if fresh PRP is used for culture or in vivo studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par37">Six healthy adult Thoroughbred horses of mixed sex, between 6 and 8 years of age, were used for this study.

Preparation of PRP was carried out using the SmartPReP 2 system (Harvest Technologies) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Briefly, 60 mL of anti-coagulated whole blood was transferred to the disposable container, centrifuged, and resuspended according to manufacturer instructions to yield 10 mL of PRP. Two kits were prepared for each horse generating a total of 20 mL of PRP per horse. Volumes of PRP were combined and mixed by inversion prior to aliquoting to ensure consistent aliquots within each horse. Aliquots of PRP and anti-coagulated whole blood were submitted for automated hematology using the Siemens Advia hematology analyzer, which has been previously validated for equine PRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].
