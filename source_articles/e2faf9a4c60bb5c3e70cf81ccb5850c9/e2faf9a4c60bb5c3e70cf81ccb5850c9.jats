Both in- and outdoor populations of filamentous fungi are a major cause of human allergies and asthma, and can in some cases, lead to severe allergic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Overall, some 30% of asthma cases can be attributed to exposure and sensitization to filamentous fungal allergens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p><italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> is an entomopathogenic fungi currently under intensive study as a biological control agent against a wide range of agricultural, nuisance, and disease carrying insect pests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. <italic>B. bassiana</italic> is considered non-pathogenic to vertebrates, has not been deemed a potential health or environmental hazard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and has received EPA approval for commercial use. Volumetric assays of allergens performed in the Netherlands in the 1980's, revealed that although the environmental concentration of <italic>Beauveria</italic> spores was very low, the allergic response was quite high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Using skin prick assays on patients with mold allergies, <italic>B. bassiana</italic> was shown to elicit one of the strongest reactions relative to the other fungal species tested. More recently, it has been confirmed that crude extracts of <italic>B. bassiana</italic> can elicit allergic reactions in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Sera IgEs derived from patients displaying allergies to molds as well as from people with no known allergies reacted with several proteins present in <italic>B. bassiana</italic> crude extracts. Many of these proteins were cross reactive with epitopes present in a number of major allergenic fungi, however the identities of any specific <italic>B. bassiana</italic> allergen has yet to be reported. In order to gain more information concerning <italic>B. bassiana</italic> and its potential allergenicity it is important to isolate the genes coding for IgE-binding allergens and characterize their protein products. Recombinant purified allergens, as compared to crude fungal extracts, can then be used to examine the nature of the IgE binding as well as in the diagnosis of allergy, in that the recombinant proteins are more standardized, can be highly purified, and hence are more suitable for immunodiagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>A significant number of fungal allergens are proteins of unknown function, although the biochemical activities of a number of allergens have been characterized. These typically fall into several classes including metabolic enzymes, proteases, and enzyme inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A molecule identified as an allergen in one species of fungus is often found to be an allergen when identified in other species, presumably due to similarities in structure and hence IgE-reactive epitopes. Thus, aldehyde dehydrogenase has been identified as an allergen in both <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> (Alt a10) and <italic>Cladosporium herbarum</italic> (Cla h3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Amongst other metabolic enzymes, enolases (2-phosho-D-glycerate hydrolase) from a wide range of organisms, are common allergens with shared epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This phenomenon of cross-reactivity of an IgE produced in response to an antigen from one organism to another can lead to wide spectrum allergic reactions derived from the original sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Here we report the identification of four <italic>B. bassiana</italic> proteins as potential allergens. Full length cDNA and genomic nucleotide sequences of the four genes were determined. Similarity search results of the translated open reading frames of the proteins coded by the genes have led to their putative designation as follows; Bb-Eno1, an enolase; Bb-Ald, aldehyde dehydrogenase; Bb-f2, similar to Asp f2 and a fibrinogen binding mannoprotein; and Bb-Hex, an N-acetylhexosaminidase. The cDNA sequences of the proteins were used to design primers for subcloning of the genes into <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vectors. All four proteins were expressed as recombinant proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Two of these proteins, Bb-Eno1 and Bb-Ald reacted with human IgEs derived from patients displaying mold allergies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Strains and cultures</title><p><italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> (ATCC 90517) was maintained on Potato dextrose (PD) agar at 26°C. <italic>E. coli</italic> stains TOPO Top10 (Invitrogen, CA) and BL21 Rosetta (DE3), harboring the pRARE plasmid (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for routine cloning and protein expression, respectively. <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) nutrient broth or agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics as indicated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Bioinformatic identification of putative allergen genes</title><p>Construction and sequencing of expressed sequence tagged (EST) cDNA libraries derived from five different developmental stages of <italic>B. bassiana</italic> has recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Cultures were inoculated with 10<sup>5</sup> conidia/ml and grown with aeration for 6 d at 25°C. Fungal cells were lysed by grinding in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted using RNAWiz (Ambion). cDNA libraries were constructed using the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech, CA) according to manufacturer instructions. For construction of <italic>E. coli</italic> expression plasmids, an NdeI restriction site was incorporated into the forward primer and an EcoRI site into the reverse primer. PCR products were cloned directly into TOPO 2.1 using TOPO TA cloning system and transformed into TOPO Top 10 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The TOPO 2.1 constructs were used for subcloning into the NdeI-EcoRI sites of pET43.1a (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) for expression using <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 host strain harboring the pRARE plasmid.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Protein expression, Western and immunoblotting</title><p>Overnight cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 harboring pRARE along with each respective pET43.1a based construct were grown in 3 ml of LB (supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 12 μg/ml chloramphenicol) at 37°C with aeration. Fresh media (5–10 ml) was inoculated with aliquots (0.1–0.2 ml) of the overnight culture, and samples were incubated at 37°C with aeration to an OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6–0.8. T7 polymerase based expression of the recombinant proteins was initiated by the addition of 1–1.5 mM (final concentration) isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and cultures were returned to the incubator for an additional 2–3 hours. For extract preparation, cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and the resultant pellet resuspended in 0.5 volumes TE (40 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Cells were lysed by sonication (3 × 30 sec) on ice, after which samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min) and separated into soluble and pellet (containing potential inclusion bodies) fractions. Samples of the crude soluble and pellet extracts were denatured with 4× LDS loading dye (Invitrogen) and boiled for 1–5 min prior to separation by SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using the Invitrogen NUPage-MOPS buffer system (10–12% Bis-tris polyacrylamide gels) according to the manufacture's recommended protocols. Gels were stained with Coomasie Blue R250 followed by destaining with 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid solution. For Western blots and immunodetection, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above, followed by electroblotting to polyvinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Invitrogen). After blocking (TBST; 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 10% dry fat free milk), membrane were probed with either individual or pooled human sera as the primary antibody solution. Typically, sera were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with membranes overnight at 4–8°C with gentle agitation. Membranes were washed 3 × using 50 ml TBST for 15 min each. Binding of human IgEs was visualized using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-human IgE (polyclonal) secondary antibody (BioSource International, CA). Membranes were incubated in secondary antibody (diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer) for 1 hr at room temperature, with gentle agitation. After secondary antibody incubation membranes were washed 3 times using 50 ml TBST and bands visualized using the Immuno-Star HRP detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Total protein membrane staining was performed using Ponceau S (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Analysis programs</title><p>Nucleotide manipulations and phylogenetic analyses were performed using multiple software programs.

As alternatives to chemical pesticides, entomopathogenic fungi such as <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic> and <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> hold promise as biological control agents, and both organisms have been EPA approved for commercial control of a variety of arthropod pests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The process of fungal infection of insect targets involves the use of infectious propagules, typically (conidia) spores, which attach and germinate across host surfaces.

Use of these biological pesticides, however, is likely to lead to the dispersal of inhalable fungal particles. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of these fungi in eliciting allergic reactions. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

Furthermore, allergen-triggered airway hyperresponsiveness and lung pathology occurred in mice sensitized with this fungus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The allergenic potential of <italic>B. bassiana</italic> has been confirmed by intradermal skin testing, and numerous IgE reactive proteins, some of which are cross-reactive among allergens from other fungi have been noted in this organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To date, however, there have been no reports detailing the molecular identification of <italic>B. bassiana</italic> (or <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>) IgE-reactive antigens.</p><p>The present study describes the cloning and expression of four putative <italic>B. bassiana</italic> allergens and demonstrated IgE-reactivity for two of the recombinant proteins using sera derived from patients displaying mold allergies. Bb-Eno1 has a calculated monomer molecular mass of 47.4 kDa and displays similarity to enolases that form an extensively studied group of allergens. IgE cross reactivity between the enolases of <italic>C. herbarum</italic>, <italic>A. alternata</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> has been well characterized and it is likely that the <italic>B. bassiana</italic> protein would also be recognized by the same IgEs. Modeling of the <italic>C herbarum</italic> enolase using the solved crystal structure of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> enolase was used to construct 10 recombinant peptides spanning the length of the <italic>C. herbarum</italic> enolase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Six of these peptides, distributed throughout the entire length of the protein showed IgE-binding activity. One of the peptides encompassed a region that overlapped with the other 5 IgE reactive peptides and formed, based upon the modeling, an extended structure that twice spanned the body of the globular protein and reached the surface three times. This sequence was therefore deemed contain at least one immunodominant IgE epitope, and sequence analyses revealed a highly similar stretch of amino acids in the deduced <italic>B. bassiana</italic> enolase sequence. Approximately 20% of the sera tested (4–6/20) displayed positive IgE reactivity to the recombinant Bb-Eno1, indicating that this protein is likely to be a significant allergen in <italic>B. bassiana</italic>.</p><p>Bb-Ald was similar to the <italic>A. alternata</italic> Alt a 10 and <italic>C. herbarum</italic> Cla h 3 proteins, both of which have been characterized as aldehyde dehydrogenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In a survey of allergens recognized by patients with mold allergies, 2% displayed IgE reactivity to Alt a 10, whereas 36% displayed reactivity to Cla h 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Based upon these results, Cla h 3 was classified as an important allergen and Alt a 10 as a minor allergen. Only one (out of twenty) of our sera displayed strong reactivity to Bb-Ald, indicating that this protein is indeed an allergen, however due to our small sample size, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the importance of this protein as a <italic>B. bassiana</italic> allergen.</p><p>Bb-f2 showed sequence homologies to the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> Asp f2 major allergen and the fibrinogen binding protein from <italic>C. albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, Asp f2 appears to be expressed as a 55-kDa mycelial glycoprotein as well as a 37-kDa culture filtrate presumably deglycosylated protein (the calculated molecular mass of Asp f2 is 29 kDa, the reason for the discrepancy is unclear but may be attributed to specific C-terminal amino acid residues), both of which are IgE reactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Asp f2 also appears to interact with extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin, and exhibited IgE binding from sera derived from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and cyctic fibrosis-ABPA patients, but not from sera isolated from <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>-sensitized allergic asthma (and normal control subjects) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, the observed lack of IgE reactivity to Bb-f2 may be attributed to the lack of ABPA patients in our sera samples.</p><p>The original cDNA fragment corresponding to Bb-Hex displayed the highest similarity to the N-acetylhexosaminidase of <italic>P. chrysogenum</italic> (Pen ch 20), that has been identified as an allergen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Subsequent, full length cDNA cloning and characterization resulted in higher similarity to other fungal hexosaminidases that have not been characterized as allergens (see E-values in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). None of our sera samples displayed IgE reactivity to recombinant Bb-Hex, however, due to our low sample size the possibility cannot be excluded that this protein represents a <italic>B. bassiana</italic> allergen.</p><p>Our results confirm the potential allergenicity of <italic>B. bassiana</italic> by the molecular and immunological characterization of specific allergens from this organism and suggest that some precautions should be taken into account in biological control applications using entomopathogenic fungi. It is, however, important not to overstate the potential risks (versus benefits) and the overall safety with respect to allergenicity of these fungi may be similar to that of baker's yeast from which allergens, including enolase, have also been isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. While it is not possible to determine the fraction of the total allergen production the four isolated proteins represents, immunoblot comparisons between the isolated proteins and the reactivity of crude <italic>B. bassiana</italic> extracts indicated the presence of numerous additional allergens that have yet to be characterized, some of which may represent more highly antigenic epitopes. The isolation of putative <italic>B. bassiana</italic> allergens described in this report relied upon identifying molecules by the resemblance of their DNA sequences to previously identified allergens and future experiments using alternate approaches (<italic>e.g</italic>. phage display [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]) may be needed to identify additional allergens. Finally, although much work has been performed in regards to isolating and characterizing fungal allergens, the roles of these proteins in fungal processes such as development and pathogenesis remains obscure. As a genetically amenable organism and a pathogen of arthropods, <italic>B. bassiana</italic> represents a novel system to examine the relationship between allergenicity and (insect) pathogenesis. Targeted gene-knockouts, for instance, can be used to probe affects upon virulence and interactions between specific allergen and arthropod innate immune systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cloning, sequencing, and heterologous expression of four putative <italic>B. bassiana</italic> allergens was performed. Recombinant proteins corresponding to Bb-Eno1 and Bb-Ald, but not Bb-f2 and Bb-Hex, displayed IgEs reactivity against sera from patients with mold allergies. Due to the low sera sample numbers used, it cannot be excluded that Bb-f2 and Bb-Hex are allergens, and further testing is warranted. Bb-Eno1 was similar to enolases that represent a well characterized group of major allergens. Bb-Ald was similar to aldehyde dehydrogenases that are considered major allergens in some fungal species, but minor allergens in others. The molecular identification of <italic>B. bassiana</italic> allergens can lead diagnostic methods for determining sensitization to this organism and provides a rational basis for allergen attenuation in order to yield safer biological control products.
