permissive for viral replication in susceptible hosts; for this purpose, viruses induce a re-wiring of the host’s physiology and development concomitant to the establishment of a successful infection. In plants, these virus-induced changes can be easily visualized and quantified, and infection by different viruses frequently produces some of a common array of symptoms, including stunting, chlorosis, and leaf curling. Possibly both enabling and resulting from these virus-triggered changes, infected hosts undergo a dramatic transcriptional reprogramming; the analysis of the modifications in the transcriptional landscape of the host upon the viral infection can shed light on the molecular processes underlying the outcome of virus-host interactions. Such transcriptional studies have proliferated in the past decade, possibly owing to technical advances allowing for in-depth sequencing, availability of genomic information, and the increased affordability of these approaches.</p><p id="Par5">Geminiviruses are insect-transmitted DNA viruses causing severe diseases in crops worldwide, and currently pose a serious threat to food security; however, our understanding of the molecular basis of the infection is still partial, which limits the development of effective anti-geminiviral strategies for crop protection. The transcriptional changes triggered by the infection by geminiviruses have been studied in a number of plant-virus interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. When comparing the results obtained in these studies, few commonalities arise: plant hormone signaling pathways, especially those for jasmonates (JA) and brassinosteroids (BR), frequently appear as altered, although the direction of the change is not consistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; and cell cycle-related genes, which need to be reactivated in the virus-infected terminally differentiated cells to allow for viral DNA replication, are detected as differentially expressed in a couple of cases only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In an attempt to unveil the molecular basis of tolerance or recovery, Chen et al. (2013) and Gongora-Castillo et al. (2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] compared the transcriptome of susceptible or tolerant tomato cultivars infected with <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> (TYLCV) and that of recovered and symptomatic leaves of pepper infected with <italic>Pepper golden mosaic virus</italic> (PepGMV), respectively, by RNA-seq; however, and somewhat surprisingly, only limited differences were detected in both cases.</p><p id="Par6">One factor frequently neglected in these transcriptional studies of geminivirus-infected plants is the low representation of infected cells in the total population: in an average infection, only some cells will be supporting viral replication at a given time. This situation becomes extreme in those cases, like that of TYLCV, in which the virus is restricted to phloem companion cells. The global transcriptome of infected plants will be the average of that in all cells, infected and non-infected, and all tissues: this not only creates a serious dilution issue, but also averages the potential transcriptional responses in infected and systemic, uninfected cells, which could be opposite, hence generating potentially misleading results difficult to interpret. However, and since to date no transcriptional profile of isolated infected cells is available, the extent to which this could be different to that obtained from complete aerial organs of an infected plant is unclear.</p><p id="Par7">In order to gain insight into how different the transcriptional landscapes of TYLCV-infected cells or whole tissues of TYLCV-infected plants might be, here we compare the transcriptional changes in leaf patches infected with TYLCV by agroinfiltration or in systemic leaves of TYLCV-infected plants in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> by RNA-seq. Strikingly, our results show that, as expected and in agreement with previous works, infection by TYLCV induces a dramatic transcriptional reprogramming; the detected changes, however, are not equivalent in local and systemic infections, with a much larger number of genes differentially expressed locally, and some genes responding in an opposite manner in local and systemic samples. Interestingly, a transcriptional repression of the auxin signaling pathway and a transcriptional activation of ethylene signaling and defence responses were detected both in local and systemic infections. Despite more limited changes detected in the systemically infected samples, comparison with the transcriptional changes induced by systemic infection by the geminivirus <italic>Tobacco curly shoot virus</italic> (TbSV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] unveiled common subsets of up- and down-regulated genes similarly affected by both viral species. Among the common biological processes potentially affected by the transcriptional changes we find terpenoid biosynthesis as transcriptionally repressed; notably, another geminivirus species, <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</italic> (TYLCCN), has been shown to suppress terpenoid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], making it tempting to speculate that depletion of terpenoids might be a requirement for geminiviruses to establish a successful infection in nature. Taken together, the results presented here not only shed light on the transcriptional changes derived from the infection by TYLCV in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, but also demonstrate that the resolution provided by local and systemic infection approaches largely differs, highlighting the urge to come up with a better system to gain an accurate view of the molecular and physiological changes caused by the viral invasion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transcriptional changes upon local infection by TYLCV in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic></title><p id="Par8">From the observation that only a fraction of cells support active replication by a geminivirus at a given time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] logically follows the idea that an accurate study of the cellular changes triggered by the viral invasion will require the isolation of the infected cells specifically, and their comparison with similar cells from an uninfected sample. Analysis of whole organs of systemically infected plants, which is the common practice due to the lack of a more precise approach, would presumably result in potential dilution and masking issues. In order to test this idea, we decided to compare the transcriptional changes detectable by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) upon local or systemic infection in the model plant <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> by the geminivirus TYLCV.</p><p id="Par9">The leaf patch infection results in the viral replication in most cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which the virus must effectively manipulate to generate a permissive environment, hence serving as a good surrogate system to study the viral infection. For the local infection, we performed agroinfection in leaf patches of four-week-old <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves and took samples at 6 days post-infiltration (dpi) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), when the virus is still actively replicating. In order to exclude the potential effect of the bacteria on plant transcription, <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves inoculated with an Agrobacterium clone containing the empty vector were used as control; three independent biological replicates were used in each case. RNA-seq was performed by Illumina sequencing as indicated in the methods section. The raw HiSeq reads were filtered and trimmed, and between 34 and &gt; 51 million clean pair-end reads were obtained per sample; these clean reads were mapped to the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> draft genome (v1.0.1) from the Sol Genomics Network (<ext-link xlink:href="ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/genomes/Nicotiana_benthamiana/assemblies/" ext-link-type="url">ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/genomes/Nicotiana_benthamiana/assemblies/</ext-link>)) with a mapping rate between 89 and &gt; 98% (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The vast difference in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these infected samples raises the possibility that the larger proportion of infected cells in the agroinfected leaf patches might provide an increase in resolution, which may result from a lower dilution of infection-induced transcriptional changes due to a higher infected-to-uninfected cell ratio and/or negligible masking from potential non-cell-autonomous plant responses to the viral infection.</p><p id="Par16">In order to gain further insight into the differences between locally and systemically infected samples, we set out to compare the subsets of induced or repressed genes in each case. Strikingly, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, both the up- and the down-regulated genes in systemic infections show only a partial overlap with those in local infections: only 56.7% of the repressed genes are also repressed in local infections, while, surprisingly, 6% are induced; among the induced genes in systemic infections, only 24% are also up-regulated in local infections, with a 23.8% down-regulated in these samples. Hierarchical clustering (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) shows that the systemically infected samples cluster closer to their control than to the locally infected samples. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the differences detected between datasets go beyond a higher sensitivity in locally infected samples, which would explain the quantitative differences in DEGs, but not the apparent opposite behavior of some of them.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Different transcriptional changes are detected upon local and systemic infections by TYLCV in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic><bold>. a</bold> Venn diagram of DEGs in local and systemic infections. <bold>b</bold> The differential gene expressions of local and systemic infection samples are shown in heatmap with hierarchical clustering, which is drawn by R package <italic>pheatmap</italic>.

As previously mentioned, the presence of the virus seems to activate plant defence responses (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figures S3; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Figure S5). Notably, both types of infection trigger a detectable transcriptional repression of auxin signaling and a transcriptional activation of ethylene signaling, while only local infections resulted in a repression of the brassinosteroid signaling pathway (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S4).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>TYLCV and TbSCV modify the expression of a set of common genes upon systemic infection in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic></title><p id="Par19">In an attempt to identify potential central targets of the transcriptional geminiviral manipulation and/or effectors of the plant anti-geminiviral response, we decided to compare the transcriptional changes triggered by systemic infections by TYLCV and the geminivirus TbSCV, in combination with or without its associated satellite, in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Remarkably, a proportion of DEG were commonly affected by both TYLCV and TbSCV (12.6% of up-regulated genes by TYLCV infection, and 9.7% of down-regulated genes by TYLCV infection) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a); the proportion of induced, but not repressed, genes largely increased (to 28.7% of up-regulated genes by TYLCV infection) when TbSCV was inoculated in combination with its satellite (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b), suggesting that some of the virulence functions provided by this ancillary molecule result in the activation of host genes and are already encoded in the TYLCV genome. Functional enrichment analysis of the genes commonly activated or repressed by TYLCV and TbSCV revealed the existence of a number of GO categories over-represented in these subsets (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), including trehalose biosynthetic process and defence responses (in the common up-regulated gene set), and terpenoid biosynthetic process (in the common down-regulated gene set). Interestingly, a third geminiviral species, TYLCCN, has been proven to suppress terpenoid biosynthesis and release, and this effect in turn improves performance of its insect vector, the whitefly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Considering this negative regulation by three different geminivirus species, it is tempting to speculate that depletion of terpenoids is a requirement for geminiviruses to establish a successful infection in nature, perhaps at least partly through an indirect effect on favouring the insect vector-virus mutualism.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Systemic infection by TYLCV and TbSCV in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> trigger partially overlapping transcriptional changes<bold>.</bold> The transcriptional changes triggered by the systemic infection by TYLCV were compared to those triggered by the geminivirus TbSCV, without (<bold>a</bold>) or with (<bold>b</bold>) its associated satellite, in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>; the TbSCV data are from Li et al., 2018</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12864_2019_5842_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></p></fig><table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>GO enrichment of DEGs common to systemic infections by TYLCV and TbSCV in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>.

sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par20">In this work, we describe and compare the genome-wide transcriptional changes detectable by RNA-seq occurring in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> upon local or systemic infection by the geminivirus TYLCV. Our results show that, as expected and in agreement with previous works, infection by TYLCV causes a strong transcriptional reprogramming in the host; however, the detectable changes are more dramatic in our local infection system. It is possible that the local infection offers higher resolution owing to lower dilution of the infected cells; however, the opposite behavior of some DEGs in local and systemic samples suggests that the absence of transcriptional changes coming from non-infected cells and masking local changes also plays a role in the differences detected. Additionally, we cannot rule out that some differences between the two infected samples could be due to differences in the stage of the infection: although in both cases the virus is actively replicating in infected cells, in the leaf patch assay the infection is supposed to be more or less synchronized, while in the systemic infection a mixture of cells at different phases of the infection is most likely present in the samples. Another potentially relevant difference between local and systemic samples is the presence of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> in the former; nevertheless, <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> is also present in the respective control. It is relevant to note that, if local and systemic samples show different results due to dilution and masking issues, these problems would potentially not only affect the study of transcriptional changes, but also the analysis of other molecular or physiological alterations resulting from the viral infection.</p><p id="Par21">Functional enrichment analyses can help us gain insight into the biological processes underlying infection by TYLCV (Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In locally infected samples, over-represented GO categories included DNA recombination among the up-regulated genes, and cytokinesis among the down-regulated genes. These processes are expected to be connected to the viral manipulation of DNA replication and cell cycle, and might not be detectable in the systemically infected samples as a result of dilution. Photosynthesis also appears as transcriptionally down-regulated; photosynthetic shut-down seems to be a common outcome in viral infections ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], among others). A transcriptional negative regulation of BR signaling can also be detected in locally infected samples; these results are in agreement with a recent work by Seo et al. (2018), in which suppression of BR signaling was shown to underpin symptom development triggered by TYLCV in tomato.</p><p id="Par22">Among those categories over-represented in both local and systemic infections, we can find cellulose biosynthetic process as transcriptionally repressed, suggesting that the viral infection might be affecting cell wall composition; changes in cell wall dynamics have been recently shown as triggered by <italic>Potato virus Y</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and <italic>Rice tungro spherical virus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and in the latter case they have been proposed to correlate with virus-induced stunting. Intriguingly, both viruses negatively impact the cellulose biosynthetic machinery; whether impaired cellulose biosynthesis is a general plant response to the viral invasion is an idea that will require further investigation. Auxin signaling is also transcriptionally repressed upon the viral infection; these changes may also mediate or modulate the impact of the viral infection on plant development.</p><p id="Par23">The identification of common subsets of up- and down-regulated genes in the systemic infections by TYLCV and TbSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] indicates that geminiviral manipulation of the cell and/or plant defence responses to geminiviral infection follow common transcriptional routes in different geminivirus/<italic>N. benthamiana</italic> interactions. Perhaps of particular interest is the finding that defence responses are activated in response to the viral infection; this observation reveals that these geminiviruses are being efficiently perceived as non-self by the plant, which in turn triggers a defence response. Although the activated plant defence reponses are not sufficient to fend off the virus, since the infection is established successfully, the fact that the plant is capable of detecting these pathogens in the first place paves the way for future engineering of the host, potentially boosting defences downstream of perception of the virus and hence tilting the balance in favour of the plant. Another pathway that emerges as a potential valuable target for engineering anti-geminiviral resistance is terpenoid biosynthesis, which is transcriptionally repressed by TYLCV and TbSV and has been proven to be suppressed by TYLCCN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], raising the idea that its down-regulation might underpin a successful geminiviral infection.</p><p id="Par24">Our results support the idea that the leaf patch assay entails great potential for the study of geminiviruses. Not only does this system result in a relatively synchronic infection and provides high resolution to detect virus-induced changes, but it also allows for the study of mutant viruses. All TYLCV null mutants for single genes, with the exception of those mutated in Rep, are capable of replicating their genome, but unable to infect the plant systemically; the use of local infections makes it possible to analyze the differences between the cellular changes triggered by wild-type and mutant viruses, therefore providing insight into the function of the viral genes in the context of the infection. An inherent limitation of this surrogate system, however, is the inevitable loss of cell type specificity: while TYLCV naturally infects phloem companion cells exclusively, in a leaf patch assay the virus is forced to replicate in mesophyll cells. Another obvious shortcoming is the impossibility of studying those mechanisms involved in cell-to-cell or long-distance transport, or the interactions between virus and vector.</p><p id="Par25">All things considered, and while the analysis of systemic and local infections has provided and will continue to provide useful insight into the molecular events underlying the infection by geminiviruses, both approaches are imperfect for a number of reasons, as mentioned above. In order to considerably deepen our view, offering a substantial leap in our understanding of the molecular and physiological changes occurring during the plant-geminivirus interaction, isolating those infected cells, ideally based on the stage of the infection, will be crucial. Several approaches would enable the isolation of geminivirus infected cells: the use of transgenic plants harbouring a replicon-based system to label those cells sustaining active viral replication (like those described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) could be combined with Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) or Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), leading to the separation of infected from non-infected cells; high-throughput single-cell sequencing would also allow the unbiased identification and analysis of those cells containing the virus in the context of the infected plant. The increase in precision and resolution provided by the isolation of infected cells and their comparison to uninfected cells in the same plant will foreseeably result in an unprecedented view of the molecular landscaping triggered by the viral invasion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par37">Our results show that TYLCV induces a dramatic transcriptional reprogramming in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, the detection of which largely differs in local and systemic infections.
