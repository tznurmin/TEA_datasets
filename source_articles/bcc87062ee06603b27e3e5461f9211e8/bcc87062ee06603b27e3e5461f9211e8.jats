However, it is not known how the epidermal barrier continuously protects nerves for the sensory homeostasis during turnover of the epidermis. Here we show that epidermal nerves are contained underneath keratinocyte tight junctions (TJs) in normal human and mouse skin, but not in human AD samples or mouse models of chronic itch caused by epidermal barrier impairment. By intravital imaging of the mouse skin, we found that epidermal nerve endings were frequently extended and retracted, and occasionally underwent local pruning. Importantly, the epidermal nerve pruning took place rapidly at intersections with newly forming TJs in the normal skin, whereas this process was disturbed during chronic itch development. Furthermore, aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in epidermal nerves were induced in association with the disturbed pruning. Finally, TRPA1 inhibition suppressed aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in epidermal nerves and itch. These results suggest that epidermal nerve endings are pruned through interactions with keratinocytes to stay below the TJ barrier, and that disruption of this mechanism may lead to aberrant activation of epidermal nerves and pathological itch.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and

ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. There are two important barrier structures in the epidermis of the skin, the cornified layer and tight junctions (TJs) formed in the granular layer (stratum granulosum, SG) right underneath the cornified layer. The genetic polymorphism affecting the cornified layer integrity has been found to be a causal factor of atopic dermatitis (AD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In addition, decreased expression of the key TJ protein has been suggested to contribute to the development of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Epidermal nerve fibers are unencapsulated nerve endings that detect noxious stimuli to conduct pain. In addition, sensory neurons innervating the epidermis are involved in the itch induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although unproven, it has been suspected that epidermal nerves are aberrantly activated by overexposure to environmental stimuli during the development of AD due to the impaired protection by the epidermal barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. For the protection of epidermal nerves, the barrier structure should homeostatically cover over the nerves.

Because epidermal nerves were reported to be extended up to the SG in the mouse skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, we visualized TJs together with nerves by the whole mount immunofluorescence staining for the TJ protein ZO-1 and pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5. Indeed, we found nerve fibers were present in such close proximity to TJs that some of them might be in contact with each other. Interestingly, however, none of the nerve fibers were found to penetrate the TJs in the normal human skin (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>; Supplementary MovieÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). In the lesional skin of AD patients (see Methods for clinical characteristics of the lesions), ZO-1 localization at TJs was undetectable as previously reported (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>; Supplementary MovieÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In severely lesioned skin areas, which had highly autofluorescent sediments, possibly of exudates over the epidermis, nerve fibers reaching the upper region of the thickened epidermis were scarcely found as described in the previous study (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In other lesional areas, nerve fibers were found in the upper epidermal region that did not show clear ZO-1 localization at TJs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; Supplementary MovieÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). Even in the non-lesional skin of AD patients, there were areas where ZO-1 localization at TJs was severely impaired, which is consistent with the previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and nerves were found in the upper epidermal region (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>; Supplementary MovieÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Epidermal nerve endings are contained under TJs in the normal human and mouse skin but not in the human AD or <italic>Spade</italic> mouse skin.

TJ-penetrating nerve fibers were scarcely found in the normal epidermis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>; Supplementary MovieÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">2</xref>). Penetration of TJs by processes of activated Langerhans cells were observed after tape stripping of the cornified layer as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Even in this condition, nerves were kept below TJs (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). Then we examined the positioning of nerve endings in an AD model, <italic>Spade</italic> (<italic>Jak1</italic><sup><italic>Spade/Spade</italic></sup>) mice, in which the point mutation in Jak1 causes epidermal barrier impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. <italic>Spade</italic> mice started to develop spontaneous dermatitis of the ear skin in the specific pathogen free condition between 7 and 16 weeks after birth as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1c,d</xref>). By using Elizabethan collars, we found that the development of <italic>Spade</italic> dermatitis lesions was dependent on scratching (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1d</xref>). In the lesioned area of the dermatitis skin (score 1 or higher), the epidermis was often destroyed, and the dermal nerve structure was disrupted, presumably by scratching (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1e</xref>). The disruption of dermal nerves was not observed in the unscratched <italic>Spade</italic> ear without lesions (score 0). However, in the epidermis of 7-week-old or older <italic>Spade</italic> mice that were yet to show the abnormal scratching behavior (score 0), we found areas where SG keratinocytes had irregular shapes and their ZO-1 localization at TJs appeared less organized (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1f</xref>; Supplementary MovieÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">2</xref>). At this pre-disease stage of the <italic>Spade</italic> epidermis, nerves were occasionally observed to penetrate TJs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>; Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1f</xref>). Additionally, in these mice, atypical accumulations of ZO-1 signals that did not appear to be a part of TJs were found around epidermal nerve fibers (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d,e</xref>). In the lesional skin with progressed dermatitis, the areas where the epidermis was not yet demolished by scratching showed an impaired ZO-1 localization at TJs, resembling human AD skin (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; Supplementary MovieÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">2</xref>).

Previous studies analyzed cutaneous nerve regeneration or remodeling induced by skin injury or hair clipping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In addition, the increase of epidermal nerves was reported in the skin of AD patients and mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, although contradicting observations have also been made<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, nerve pruning in the body surface tissues has been characterized in Drosophila pupae and Zebrafish during development or regeneration after injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, the present report is the first to characterize constitutive pruning and remodeling of sensory nerves in the adult mammalian epidermis.</p><p id="Par20">Importantly, our results suggest that the epidermal nerve pruning plays a role in the maintenance of their homeostatic positioning under the TJ barrier. It has been proposed that epidermal barrier impairment promotes the exposure of epidermal nerves to external environmental agents to cause AD itch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In this model, the cornified layer is important for the protection of epidermal nerves as it covers all the other skin components including nerves. Our study suggests that, in addition to the cornified layer, TJs in the SG are involved in the protection of epidermal nerves from external agents. Consistent with this concept, the itch development in <italic>Spade</italic> mice seemed to coincide with the impairment of their epidermal TJs, while the barrier function of their cornified layer was already weakened at least a couple of weeks before the itch onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Our imaging results also suggest that the epidermal nerve pruning takes place as a result of previously unknown interactions between epidermal nerves and keratinocytes. The nerve pruning at intersections with newly forming TJs could be a result of mechanical constriction of nerve fibers by the newly forming TJs. It is also possible that nerves play an active role in the pruning mechanism by inducing molecular changes in their parts to be trimmed in response to the TJ formation around them. The local Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations that we observed during pruning might be one of such changes. From our low time-resolution imaging analysis, however, it is not clear whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases during pruning began before the onset of nerve pruning in the normal epidermis. Therefore, we do not exclude that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases during pruning might be secondary to the plasma membrane disruption in the beginning of pruning. When nerve pruning took place in positions where TJs were not forming, keratinocytes appeared to actively respond to adjacent nerve fibers, because ZO-1-Venus protein transiently accumulated at the site of nerve pruning. In this case as well, whether and how the transient accumulation of ZO-1 and possibly other TJ proteins is mechanistically involved in the nerve severing should be clarified by future researches.</p><p id="Par22">In the <italic>Spade</italic> mouse skin, after the shape of TJ-forming keratinocytes became atypical, the epidermal nerve pruning at newly formed TJs was delayed compared to that in the normal skin, and nerve fibers penetrated TJs without being pruned for hours. Furthermore, repetitive or sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in epidermal nerves and Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes that reached dermal nerves were induced before and when pruning of the epidermal nerves finally took place. Therefore, it is likely that the nerve fibers showing the aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases were penetrating TJs for a prolonged time before pruned. In agreement with this possibility, the frequency of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases preceding pruning in Spade mice in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref> was consistent with the frequency of nerve fibers that penetrated TJs without getting pruned for prolonged time in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref> and also with the frequency of TJ-penetrating nerve fibers in the fixed tissue in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. The aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases might be caused by environmental stimulations to epidermal nerves that penetrated the TJ barrier. Alternatively, and more intriguingly, it is possible that prolonged interactions between epidermal nerves and compromised TJs might aberrantly activate the nerves to evoke the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases and action potentials.</p><p id="Par23">The SG-innervating neurons were reported to be polymodal nociceptors, which transmit pain and/or itch in response to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. As <italic>Spade</italic> mice do not show signs of abnormal pain, it is highly possible that the aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in nerve fibers innervating the SG are involved in the induction of <italic>Spade</italic> itch. This possibility is further supported by the observations that both epidermal nerve Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases and itch were attenuated by the TRPA1 inhibition in <italic>Spade</italic> mice. Future studies need to examine if specific depletion of the SG-innervating neurons or conditional depletion of TRPA1 only in the SG-innervating neurons gives consistent results.</p><p id="Par24">The <italic>Spade</italic> mutation in the Jak1 gene causes hyperactivation of JAK1 in keratinocytes, and the consequent skin barrier impairment appears to be a major cause of the itch development because petrolatum covering of the ear skin delayed the disease onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, hyperactivation of JAK1 in sensory nerves likely promotes the development and/or exacerbation in the <italic>Spade</italic> dermatitis. Recent studies have found that type-2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-31 directly act on sensory neurons that express the cytokine receptors to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases <italic>ex vivo</italic> and itch in a JAK1-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Barrier impairment-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in epidermal nerves do not necessarily require the Jak1 mutation because they were observed not only in <italic>Spade</italic> mice but also in AEW-treated mice without the Jak1 mutation. Nonetheless, it is plausible that JAK1 hyperactivation in <italic>Spade</italic> sensory nerves contributes to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase and itch, as intensities of both appear to be higher in <italic>Spade</italic> mice than in AEW-treated mice. Thus, it is proposed that in the inflammatory skin milieu, JAK1 activation in both keratinocytes and sensory nerves contributes to sensory nerve activation to transmit itch.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par25">All experimental protocols were approved by the RIKEN Animal Experiment Committee, and all experiments were performed in accordance with the Regulations and Guidelines for Animal Experiments of RIKEN. <italic>Spade</italic> mice and ZO-1-Venus mice have been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

Collared mice were maintained on sheet type cage bedding PULMAS 3000 (Material Research Center Scitex), because bedding chips would have stuck to their hair that became greasy over time due to their inability to groom. Each collared mouse was euthanized as soon as the behavioral or imaging analysis of the mouse was completed. For the induction of dry skin-associated itch, we performed sebum depletion in the ear skin. For this purpose, we modified the previously described protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Mice that had been wearing Elizabethan collars for five days were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane for 20âs and then with 1.5% isoflurane.

The collared mice received these treatments twice a day (in the morning and evening) for 7 to 9 days until the mice showed significant scratching behavior. To analyze scratching behavior, the behavior of <italic>Spade</italic> mice and AEW-treated mice was recorded on a portable video camera (Panasonic, HC-V360MS-W) for 5 and 30âmin, respectively. The number of strokes with the hind paw to scratch the ear was visually counted in the videos. In the experiments to analyze the effect of the TRPA1 inhibitor on Spade itch, the number of scratching strokes by the hind paws was determined by using the MicroAct system (Neuroscience Inc.) in combination with video camera recording. At least a week before the analysis, a Teflon-coated cylindrical magnet (Ã1 mmâÃâ3âmm) was subcutaneously implanted into each of both insteps of isoflurane-anesthetized mice. Small incisions made for the magnet implantation were sealed by Aron Alpha A (Sankyo). Each mouse was placed into a chamber surrounded by a detection coil to measure motions of the implanted magnet for 30âmin. Behavior of the mouse was simultaneously recorded by a video camera placed on the transparent lid of the chamber. After the first 30âmin recording, 20âÎ¼L of ethanol or 20âÎ¼L of 620âÎ¼M HC-030031 in ethanol was topically applied onto each of both ears (approximately 10âÎ¼L onto each side of an ear flap).
