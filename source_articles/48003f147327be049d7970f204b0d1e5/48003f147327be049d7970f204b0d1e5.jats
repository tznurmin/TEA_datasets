We show that GFI1 prevents induction of p53 dependent apoptosis by recruiting LSD1 to p53, which leads to the demethylation of its C-terminal domain. This is accompanied by a decrease of the acetylation of lysine 117 within the core domain of the murine p53 protein, which is required for transcriptional induction of apoptosis. Our results support a model in which the effect of GFI1’s regulation of methylation at the c-terminus of p53 is ultimately mediated through control of acetylation at lysine 117 of p53. We propose that GFI1 acts prior to the occurrence of DNA damage to affect the post-translational modification state and limit the subsequent activation of p53. Once activated, p53 then transcriptionally activates GFI1, presumably in order to re-establish the homeostatic balance of p53 activity. These findings have implications for the activity level of p53 in various disease contexts where levels of GFI1 are either increased or decreased.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gouvernement du Canada | Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Instituts de Recherche en Sant&amp;amp;#x00E9;

GFI1 accomplishes this by recruiting the de-methylase LSD1 and histone de-acetylases such as HDAC1 to target promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. GFI1 also has oncogenic activity by promoting survival in leukemic T cells and is required for the development and maintenance of T cell leukemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In this role, GFI1 antagonizes the p53-dependent induction of apoptosis, in part through regulating post-translational modifications at the C-terminal domain of the p53 protein, and as a consequence through transcriptional regulation of the key apoptotic targets <italic>Bax</italic>, <italic>Bbc3</italic> (<italic>Puma</italic>) and <italic>Pmaip1</italic> (<italic>Noxa</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In addition, GFI1 has been shown to promote DNA repair itself by regulating the activity of DNA repair proteins such as MRE11 and 53BP1 following damage and to contribute to T cell survival in this manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. GFI1 has also been shown to favour the survival and accumulation of myeloid cells in myelo-proliferative disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, potentially due to its role in repressing p53 activity.</p><p id="Par3">It has long been established that the activity of p53 is regulated by the modulation of the protein’s stability by ubiquitination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, in recent years, additional post-translational modifications (PTMs) including acetylation and methylation have emerged as critical factors in the regulation of p53 activity. Transcriptional regulation by p53 of targets involved in specific biological functions has been associated with sets of corresponding PTMs. For instance, mutant mouse p53 proteins carrying lysine to arginine mutations at 3 lysine residues (117, 161, 162, corresponding to residues 120 and 164 in the human protein, which has one fewer lysine at this location) in the DNA-binding domain of p53 are deficient in inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and senescence, whereas a p53 protein carrying a single lysine to arginine substitution at residue 117 (120 in the human protein) is only deficient in inducing apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Regulation of p53 through modification of its C-terminal Domain (CTD) has also been shown to be important for its activity, however its exact role is not clearly defined, as there is conflicting evidence in the literature. Studies have shown that the CTD is involved in the regulation of p53 DNA binding, the interaction with its negative regulator MDM2, and the regulation of its stability, among other functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Of particular interest here are several reports showing that the impact of the CTD on p53 activities is likely context- and cell type-specific. For example, through ectopic expression of mutant p53 proteins in several human cancer cell lines, it was found that p53 binding to the key apoptotic target <italic>Puma</italic> requires the CTD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, while later work using mouse models and murine primary cells showed that expression of CTD-deleted p53 actually increased <italic>Puma</italic> expression and induction of cell death in thymocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Given the complexity and the number of potential residue modifications within the p53 protein, their individual roles are not yet fully understood, and neither is the interplay between modifications of different residues.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we focus on detailing how GFI1 activity affects post-translational modification of p53 at both the C-terminus and at lysine 117, and how this translates into changes in induction of apoptosis in T cells. We take advantage of multiple mouse models to characterize the mechanism by which GFI1 regulates p53 activity in this way. We first use a <italic>Gfi1</italic> KO mouse model as well as a model expressing a mutant GFI1 protein with a proline to alanine mutation at residue 2 (P2A), which affects its interaction with other proteins, notably LSD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our <italic>Gfi1</italic> KO model features a GFP coding sequence, which is inserted in-frame with the initiation codon of <italic>Gfi1</italic> and replaces exons 3–5 of the <italic>Gfi1</italic> gene, resulting in the production of a GFP transcript under the control of <italic>Gfi1</italic>’s regulatory sequences and the absence of GFI1 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">We also use a mouse model expressing a truncated form of the p53 protein lacking the 24 C-terminal amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This model (p53 ΔCTD) lacks several lysine residues (K370, K372, K373, K381, K382, K386 K387 in the mouse protein, corresponding to K370, K372, K373, K381, K382, K386 in the human protein) that can be modified by methylation and acetylation. Finally, we use a knock-in mouse expressing a mutant p53 in which a lysine to arginine substitution at residue 117 (p53 K117R) prevents an acetylation event necessary for the transactivation by p53 of genes critical for the induction of apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we show that in T cells, GFI1 blocks the accumulation of methylation marks at the CTD of p53, which in turn inhibits the acetylation of K117. In addition, we demonstrate that GFI1 is activated by p53 following DNA damage. Given that GFI1 antagonizes the function of p53, our results suggest that GFI1 plays a role in post-translational negative feedback regulation of p53 induced by p53’s own transcriptional activity, as is seen with other regulators of p53, such as MDM2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The intermediate domain of GFI1 interacts with the C-terminal domain of p53</title><p id="Par8">To fully characterize the interaction between GFI1 and p53, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments using a series of GFI1 mutants. These experiments showed that the full-length form of GFI1 is capable of interacting with p53, and that deletion of the intermediary domain of GFI1 prevents this interaction, whereas deletions of the SNAG domain or of the DNA binding domain of GFI1 had no effect on the binding to p53 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>). This is in contrast with the interaction between GFI1 and the de-methylase enzyme LSD1, which requires the SNAG domain of GFI1 for interaction. Further analysis of GFI1 variants with deletions in the intermediary domain showed that different sizeable deletions across the intermediate domain decreased the interaction with p53, without identifying a single critical region, suggesting that the domain as a whole may be involved (Suppl. Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1A</xref>). Conversely, Co-IP experiments using deletion variants of the p53 protein showed that its C-terminal domain, but not the N-terminal domain of the protein, is required for its interaction with GFI1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C,D</xref>), suggesting that the intermediate domain of GFI1 interacts with p53’s C-terminal end (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Interestingly, further Co-IP experiments showed that the interaction between the two proteins is unaffected by the presence of benzonase or ethidium bromide (EtBr), indicating that the p53/GFI1 interaction is independent of DNA binding (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F,G</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1B</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The intermediate domain of GFI1 interacts with the C-terminal domain of p53 (<bold>A</bold>) 293T cells were transfected with vectors expressing variants of the GFI1-Flag-HA fusion protein.

Using Co-IP experiments with these antibodies and others specific for post-translationally modified p53 residues, we show that, in addition to the previously reported increase in K372 mono-methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, K370 di-methylation as well as K117 acetylation was also increased in <italic>Gfi1</italic> KO thymocytes. Interestingly, these increases were independent of DNA damage induction by irradiation, unlike the well-described phosphorylation of S15 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>).

Overexpression of SMYD2 readily induced K370 di-methylation in these cells, while a catalytically inactive SMYD2-GEE mutant did not, as expected (Suppl.

We found that concomitant overexpression of either GFI1 or LSD1 blocked the accumulation of K370 di-methylation induced by SMYD2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). This effect was dose-dependent, as overexpression of increasing levels of exogenous GFI1 showed a proportional reduction in K370 di-methylation (Suppl.

Importantly, overexpression of mutant variants of GFI1 that cannot interact with LSD1, namely GFI1 P2A and GFI1 ΔSNAG, did not lead to a decrease in p53-K370 di-methylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that GFI1 causes de-methylation of the C-terminal domain of p53 through recruitment of LSD1, as previously suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, our results show that GFI1 antagonizes the accumulation of the acK117 mark, which is key to inducing apoptosis.

Similarly to what we observed in the <italic>Gfi1</italic> KO model, the absence of p53 CTD leads to increased apoptosis in thymocytes exposed to IR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>), as well as increased recruitment of p53 to the promoters of <italic>Bax</italic>, <italic>Puma</italic>, <italic>Noxa</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), an increase in the level of p53 K117 acetylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>) and a greater induction of the expression of apoptotic genes following IR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). These results also suggest that a p53 protein carrying an un-methylated CTD, as mediated by the activity of GFI1, is less able to induce the apoptotic response than the methylated one and that the complete removal of the CTD prevents this check on p53 activity, leading to unrestrained p53 activation, as is seen in Gfi1 KO cells.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The effect of GFI1 in p53 regulation is mediated through K117 of p53.

Most importantly, we still detected an increase in p53 C-terminal K370 di-methylation and K372 di-methylation in the GFI1 KO p53 K117R cells after IR, similar to what we observed in GFI1 KO cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). This shows that the regulation exerted at the C-Terminal domain of p53 is not sufficient to induce apoptosis on its own and strongly suggests that the effect of GFI1 on apoptosis is ultimately mediated through the regulation of p53 K117 acetylation. This is supported by p53 ChIP experiments using combinatorial GFI1 KO and p53 K117R mutant mice, which show that while GFI1 KO leads to an increase in p53 recruitment to promoters of the apoptotic genes <italic>Bax</italic>, <italic>Puma</italic> and <italic>Noxa</italic>, it does not lead to any increase in the recruitment of p53K117R to these promoters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). This also suggests that the increase in C-terminal methylation of p53 in GFI1 KO cells only leads to an increase in apoptotic response after acetylation at K117.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>GFI1 and p53 are part of a regulatory feedback loop</title><p id="Par14">The data presented here, as well as previous reports, show that GFI1 is a critical regulator of p53 activities, at least in thymocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Other studies indicated that p53 might regulate GFI1 expression, suggesting a possible regulatory feedback loop between these two proteins, in a manner similar to the well-established p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop. To determine whether p53 controls GFI1 in thymocytes, we measured the mRNA levels of <italic>Gfi1</italic> in p53 WT and KO cells at baseline as well as following exposure to IR and observed that while <italic>Gfi1</italic> mRNA levels were not altered by p53 KO at baseline, they increased following exposure to IR in a p53 dependent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Consistent with this, ChIP enrichment of p53 at the Gfi1 promoter increased following IR exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). In order to further study the relationship between GFI1 and p53, we took advantage of the fact that the Gfi1 KO construct expresses a non-functional GFI1-GFP mutant mRNA that can still be measured using primers that recognize the 3’UTR of Gfi1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in cells expressing the Gfi1-GFP mRNA (and thus lacking a functional GFI1 protein), the binding of p53 to the Gfi1 promoter was increased both in the absence of DNA damage as well as following exposure to IR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Furthermore, the levels of the GFI1-GFP mRNA were higher than the baseline levels of normal Gfi1 mRNA and these levels increased even further following irradiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). These results are consistent with a model whereby GFI1 is a p53-activated negative feedback regulator of p53, since in the absence of a functional GFI1 protein p53 binds more strongly to the promoter of GFI1 and induces it without being repressed in return.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>GFI1 is a negative feedback regulator of p53 (<bold>A</bold>) Thymocytes were extracted from p53 WT or KO mice.

While methyltransferases- and acetylases-dependent PTMs prime p53 for potent pro-apoptotic responses after DNA damage, GFI1 favours the removal of these marks, through the recruitment of the lysine de-methylase LSD1 at K370 and K372, and through an unknown mechanism at K117, which leads to restrained p53 activities. Upon exposure to DNA damage, the modified form of p53 is more strongly activated than its unmodified counterpart and it promotes both a potent apoptotic response and the transactivation of GFI1, which in turn leads to a de-methylation of p53 and its inactivation hence forming a novel negative feedback loop (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par16">Our results indicate that a regulatory circuit exists between GFI1 and p53 that controls the induction of apoptosis in T cells. We speculate that this link may exist in other cell types that express GFI1, such as myeloid cells, where a link between the two proteins has also been suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">Our study builds on a previously suggested mechanism of regulation of p53 activity by GFI1, which proposed that the two proteins form a complex with the lysine de-methylase LSD1. Using deletion mutants and biochemical approaches we were able to characterize the domains critical for the interaction between GFI1 and p53 proteins, i.e. the intermediate domain of GFI1 and the C-Terminal domain of p53. Interestingly, the intermediate domain of GFI1 has also recently been shown to mediate its interaction with the DNA repair protein MRE11 and the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 that targets it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This suggests that this domain of GFI1 is involved in the regulation of functions related to p53 activity and DNA repair, whereas the SNAG domain at the very N-terminal end of GFI1 is more closely, but not exclusively, associated with its transcriptional activity. This also indicates that GFI1 has two very different mechanisms of action, one as a DNA binding transcription factor and another one as a bridging factor facilitating contact between enzymes and their protein substrates and enabling specific PTMs to take place.</p><p id="Par18">We provide new evidence that the recruitment of LSD1 to p53 is necessary for the effect of GFI1 on p53 CTD methylation and consequently on apoptosis. Furthermore, our work with the p53ΔCTD mouse model shows that this form of p53 is overactive and induces apoptosis more readily than wild-type p53. This is in agreement with the original report describing this mouse model and defines the CTD as a negative regulator of p53 activity in thymocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These data also suggest that a non-methylated CTD, as seen in GFI1 expressing cells, acts in a way that represses p53 activation.</p><p id="Par19">Importantly, we show that C-terminal methylation on its own is insufficient to control p53-induced apoptosis but also requires acetylation at lysine 117 to have an effect of p53 activity. Our experiment with a K117R mutant variant of p53 demonstrates this, since cells from this mutant do not undergo apoptosis regardless whether Gfi1 is present or not. This mutation effectively renders the increase in C-terminal domain methylation seen in Gfi1 KO cells inoperative or incapable of increasing p53’s activity. These results support the notion that GFI1’s effect on programmed cell death is ultimately dependent on its ability to control acetylation of the K117 residue of p53 <italic>via</italic> the regulation of CTD methylation. It also suggests that other regulatory pathways that involve methylation events at p53’s CTD may ultimately be mediated through PTM of other p53 domains. Notably, this idea is consistent with findings indicating that the CTD of p53 may be involved in conformational changes of the DNA binding domain, which contains the K117 residue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">All effects of GFI1 on post-translational modifications of p53 that we analyzed here are independent of both exposure to irradiation and interaction with DNA, suggesting that GFI1’s role is to control the extent to which p53 is “primed” to induce apoptosis once DNA damage occurs. In the context of GFI1 KO, there appears to be excessive priming of p53, leading to greater induction of apoptosis, although a death-inducing stimulus, such as exposure to IR, is still required to fully activate p53. Although this function of GFI1 is distinct from its canonical role as a DNA binding transcription factor, it remains to be determined whether GFI1 additionally plays a direct transcriptional role in regulating the induction of apoptosis and to which extent both functions overlap.</p><p id="Par21">Although data exist in the literature showing that p53 can regulate GFI1, other conflicting evidence suggests that this regulation is context specific. For instance, p53 KO BM Lineage<sup>-</sup>Sca<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells have been shown to have lower baseline levels of GFI1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, while another group has shown this effect occurs in the spleen and thymus, but not in the bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, others have shown that p53 represses GFI1 expression specifically following DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. This is in contrast with the data presented here showing that GFI1 is transcriptionally activated following IR exposure in a p53-dependent manner. This discrepancy may be explained by the different cell systems used, i.e. murine primary T cells for the present study versus a murine pro B cell line and several human cancer cell lines in the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, our own experiments were carried out within a much shorter time frame after exposure to DNA damage (2–6 h vs. &gt;24 h). Nevertheless, our data otherwise agree with findings from the literature that GFI1 antagonizes the p53-dependent apoptotic response. Given the data present here and the fact that the activation of key pro-apoptotic targets of p53 is dampened by the action of GFI1, it is likely that GFI1 is a negative feedback regulator of p53 in T cells. Indeed, the increased binding of p53 at the <italic>Gfi1</italic> promoter, and the increased <italic>Gfi1</italic> transcript levels in the absence of a functional GFI1 protein strongly support this notion and a model in which p53 and GFI1 are members of a regulatory circuit controlling apoptosis in T-cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Mouse Strains</title><p id="Par22">Gfi1 KO and Gfi1 P2A mice used in this study have been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. p53CTD Mutant Mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and p53 K117R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> mutant mice were graciously provided by the laboratories of James Manfredi and Wei Gu, respectively.
