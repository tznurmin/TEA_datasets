The <italic>de novo</italic> genome sequencing of several field isolates and stages available could be used for understanding the molecular pathogenesis. The presence of gaps and low coverage of assembled genomes poses a problem in accurate functional annotation of such functions. In the present study attempts were made to improve the Ti draft genome through reconciliation of globally available datasets of three highly virulent monoteliospore cultures of Ti field isolates. It has sequence depth of 107x and N50 scaffold size of 80,772 (more than 26 times as large as achieved in the draft assembly) with highest sequence contiguity, more accurate and nearly complete. Functional annotation revealed that Ti genome contains 9209 genes evolved with many expanded gene families and arranged mostly in a cluster. About 79% of Ti genes were orthologous to other basidiomycetes fungi, Around 7.93% proteins were having secretary signals and 6.66% were identified as highly virulent pathogenicity genes. Using improved Ti genome as a reference, the genomic variation was assessed with respect to repeats, SNPs/InDel, gene families and correct set of virulence associated genes during its life cycle. The comparative intra-species, inter-stage and inter-species genomic variation will have broader implications to understand the gene regulatory networks involved in growth, mating and virulence behaviour of <italic>Tilletia</italic> f. spp. and also for better appreciation of fungal biology and disease management.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology (DBT)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">BT/PR14987/AGR/21/914/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Anil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_44464.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="AuthorContribution"><p>Pallavi Mishra and Ranjeet Maurya contributed equally.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Karnal bunt (KB) of wheat crops was first reported in Karnal in India in 1931<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and caused by the smut fungus <italic>Tilletia indica</italic> (Ti) basidiomycetes belonging to the subphylum Ustilaginomycotina. Approximately 86 years have been passed since the discovery of the Karnal bunt disease, there is only scanty molecular information is available in relation to the pathogenicity of Ti. It became a major disease which hampers the international wheat trade due to quarantine regulations imposed by several countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The fungus is heterothallic in nature and undergoes a transition from monokaryotic to dikaryotic developmental stages during its life cycle. Due to heterothallism, there exists large genetic variation amongst pathogen due to the fusion of opposite mating types of sporidia and thus affecting virulence behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. During onset of the disease, mating between two compatible allantoids sporidia of Ti and resultant genetic recombination generates significant pathogenic and genetic variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The primary sporidia give rise to secondary sporidia by budding, which continuously multiply on the host leaf surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and through monkey jumping it moves from lower to upper leaf surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. It infect between the boot leaf and soft dough stage, approximately a fort night, depending on the cultivar and the weather conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and later on penetrate the wheat floret through stomata<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Growth of the mycelium inside the pericarp eventually raptures the connection between the pericarp and surrounding vascular bundles and as a result, the seed atrophies to varying degree and leading to partial bunt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. When the teliospores are liberated at harvest to the soil surface or dispersed on or in grain, the cycle begins again. In the life cycle of Ti, teliospores are the main disease-causing entities, which exist in nature as dikaryons. The teliospores are widely disseminated through the seeds of the host plant inside or outside and soil.</p><p id="Par3">In order to understand the fungal biology of this pathogen, the life cycle has created a rapidly rising demand for development of insights about various components of molecular pathogenesis. Several biochemical and molecular biology approaches have been used for identification and characterization of pathogenic determinants or virulence factors for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying fungal pathogenesis. Availability of complete and accurate genomic information of fungus is required to understand the offence and defence mechanism(s) during wheat – Ti interaction and fungal pathogenesis. To date, attempts have been made by several research groups to sequence and decipher the genome information generated using various next generation sequencing platforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The draft assembly published in 2017 with the total assembly size of 26.7 Mb, was quite fragmented containing over 10,957 contigs whose weighted average (N50) size was 3,009 bp, thus indicating loss of valuable information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Redundancy in genetic profiling of the fungus Ti is confusing and necessitates refinement of available genome sequence data generated from assembly of monoteliosporic cultures of Ti. In order to obtain a complete set of coded genes, then it is pre-requisite to acquire the completeness of the whole genome that should be more accurate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The three draft assemblies of the monoteliosporic culture of Ti were used to develop an improved version of genome assembly by using the reconciliation methods. Such strategies have not been utilized in Ti and based on such study; an improved genome sequence of Ti was reported first time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> that will help in better understanding of fungal pathogenesis and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The improved Ti genome sequence with decreased redundancy and genomes described by different Ti projects was employed to examine inter-stage genomic diversity in teliospores (mycelium), monosporidial lines (+ and − mating types) and dikaryon level during different developmental stages in Ti lifecycle. Such comparative genomic analysis of monosporidial and monoteliosporic cultures will not only help in unravelling the complexity of molecular pathogenesis of Ti pathogen of wheat but also understanding the mechanisms associated with intra-species and inter-species genetic variability at molecular level. Further, the direct comparison between these genome assemblies of Ti was made by the detailed analysis of the whole genomes with monosporidial and dikaryon level of developmental stages, core protein coding genes including secretary proteins analysis and comparison of orthologous gene families led to the identification of pathogenesis-related genes. The diversity of Ti isolates were analyzed using genome based variation analysis of different Ti isolates. Identified SSR, SNP, Indel and repeat elements among different field isolates analyzed apart from establishing accurate phylogenic relationships that may help in better understanding the plasticity and dynamic behaviour of Ti genomes to overcome the host plant immune systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Improvement of the draft genome through reconciliation algorithms for intra-species monoteliosporic assemblies of different isolates</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Refinement of the fragmented draft genome of TiK isolate through Hybrid <italic>de novo</italic> reassembly approach</title><p id="Par5">Genome assemblies using hybridSPAdes performed with multiple k-mer combination ranging from 21 to 101 suggested that the best assemblies was built with k-mers 63, 65, 67 and 69.

The analysis of variation in repeats reflects the number of predominant repeats was increasing during the development stage of fungal lifecycle which proceeds from haploid to diploid stages.

The enhancement of such repeats during disease cycle of KB pathogen provides an advantage to the pathogen as it may help to produce those proteins during infection with in host and thus increase their survival and pathogenicity.

TiK_1 and TiK isolates had a similar SNP pattern of distribution regions. There were 2,571 InDels identified in TiK_1 and 2,683 identified in TiK isolate. The significantly fewer InDels may be a result of lower sequencing depth. Interestingly, the distribution pattern of InDels was different from the SNP pattern. Although SNPs and InDels in coding regions can have effects on associated proteins and sometimes alter the phenotype, the chance and level of the influence from SNPs or InDels are hard to predict. Nearly linked SNPs to coding regions may have some impact on future marker development to develop resistant variety of wheat. Thus, it is suggestive that SNPs containing regions were most polymorphic, which causing large modification in protein sequences and thus altering gene function, which can give the evidence of pathogenesis in the future examination. The KB pathogen undergoes the rapid genetic recombination during development that leads to several mutations. However, many of the mutations that are not found in coding regions or within actual genes, which makes it difficult to understand their role in alteration of function but certainly involved in huge genetic variation. Using the SNP data from our study associated with genes, we will be able to find the altered behaviour of fungal disease causing ability more quickly.
