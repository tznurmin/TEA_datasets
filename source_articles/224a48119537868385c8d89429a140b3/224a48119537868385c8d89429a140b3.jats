Exposure to HIV or antiretroviral therapy may influence immune development, which could increase morbidity and mortality. However, a direct link between the increased mortality and morbidity and the infant’s immune system has not been identified. To provide a global picture of the neonatal T cell repertoire in HEU versus HU infants, the diversity of the T cell receptor beta chain (TRB) expressed in cord blood samples from HEU infants was determined using next-generation sequencing and compared to healthy (HU) infants collected from the same community. While the TRB repertoire of HU infants was broadly diverse, in line with the expected idea of a naïve T cell repertoire, samples of HEU infants showed a significantly reduced TRB diversity. This study is the first to demonstrate differences in TRB diversity between HEU and HU cord blood samples and provides evidence that maternal HIV, in the absence of transmission, influences the adaptive immune system of the unborn child.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>U.S. Department of Health &amp;amp;

Between the years 2009 and 2014 this group of children, known as HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants, increased by more than 1 million<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In countries with high HIV prevalence up to 30–40% of births will be to HIV-positive mothers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, while HIV transmission rates during pregnancy have been reduced to less than 1% in resource-rich countries with high coverage of PMTCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">There is emerging evidence that HEU infants differ from HIV-unexposed (HU) infants. HEU have a higher risk of morbidity, mortality, growth compromise, developmental delays, and differences in immune development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Immunological differences have been identified mainly at the cell population level. HEU infants have lower CD4 T cell counts compared to HU infants, and these lower T cell counts correlate inversely with viral loads measured in antiretroviral therapy-(ART)-treated women at the time of delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Additional alterations found in T cell populations in HEU infants compared to HU infants include: (a) increased frequencies of activated T cells during early lifetime, (b) increased memory T cell populations, and (c) increased populations of immature T cells, which indicates a disturbed T cell development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Further evidence of a defective development of various areas of the immune system can be found at the level of innate immunity, such as monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> or natural killer (NK) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Some immunological changes may reflect exposure to antiretroviral therapy, such as lower neutrophil counts found in HEU infants compared to HU infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The significance of immune changes in HEU children is undefined. Reports of vaccine-induced cellular immune and antibody responses in HEU infants are contradictory: vaccines against Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and pertussis stimulate lower levels of response in HEU than HU, while others report a full vaccine schedule for pertussis and pneumococcus results in similar levels of response among HEU and HU infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Our study is based on the hypothesis that <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to HIV interacts with the development of the immune system of the unborn child on a broad scale. To test this assumption, the T cell repertoire of the newborn was examined using next-generation sequencing of umbilical cord blood, which represents the status of prenatal immune exposure, and the time point of the most naïve immune system. We have designed a study drawing on birth samples from two historic cohorts, one with <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to HIV that did not lead to infection, and one with no exposure to HIV. We further selected infant samples from the larger parent studies with the lowest probability of dysregulation: Infants born at normal birth weight and gestational age from mothers with no history of sexually transmitted diseases other than HIV.</p><p id="Par6">HEU specimens used in this study (n = 19) were collected between 1992 and 1997 in Nairobi, Kenya<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Of particular importance here is the absence of any antiretroviral medication given to the mothers for PMTCT, which was only introduced in the 2000s. By drawing on samples from the pre-ART era in this region, we can rule out any drug effect on the T cell repertoire of HEU infants, something not possible within contemporary studies.</p><p id="Par7">An HIV-uninfected birth cohort was established between 2003 and 2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, which served as the source for the control samples used in this study (n = 9).

Sequencing of the TCR repertoire of HEU and HU cord blood samples was performed using an amplicon-based library preparation and sequencing on Illumina’s MiSeq instrument. The sequencing performance, as measured by raw read counts, was within the expected range of 1 million reads for each sample. Sequencing samples of HEU cord blood achieved nearly equal number of raw reads than HU cord blood samples: median raw read counts for HEU and HU cord blood samples were 9.55 × 10<sup>5</sup> (IQR 8.32–10.81 × 10<sup>5</sup>) vs 7.26 × 10<sup>5</sup> (IQR 6.5–9.22 × 10<sup>5</sup>), respectively. Despite similar raw read counts, the number of successfully identified TRB sequences differed substantially between the two sample groups. The number of successfully assigned TRB sequences within HEU samples was 6.84 × 10<sup>5</sup> (IQR 5.08–9.07 × 10<sup>5</sup>) compared to 0.72 × 10<sup>5</sup> (IQR 0.57–1.68 × 10<sup>5</sup>) for HU samples. Based on the assigned TRB sequences we were able to identify a median 17,242 (IQR 12,290–33,709) unique clonotypes in HEU samples and a median of 505 (IQR 426–1,374) unique clonotypes in HU samples. Each clonotype represents a defined TRB-CDR3 (complementarity determining region 3) sequence combination. To investigate the low number of assigned sequences and unique clonotypes in the HU samples, we evaluated the quality of the extracted RNA. We observed differences between the two groups as measured by RNA integrity numbers (RIN). Lower RIN scores were measured for the samples of the HU group (median 2.5, IQR 2.1–2.7) compared to the samples of the HEU group (median 7.9, IQR 7.2–8.6), potentially causing the loss of successfully assigned TRB sequences. Taken together, samples from HU infants yielded fewer TRB sequences and identifiable clonotypes than samples from HEU infants due to lower RIN scores.</p><p id="Par11">To assess the effect of the measured RIN scores on the sequencing results, we compared the usage of the variable region of the T cell receptor beta chain gene (TRBV) across both HEU and HU groups. We observed no significant difference in the proportions of common TRBV families detected in the HEU compared to the HU population.

Furthermore, HIV replication is known to create a pro-inflammatory environment within HIV-infected patients by continuously weakening mucosal barriers, leading to persistent translocation of microbial products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This is true even in the presence of ART where systemic virus replication is undetectable.

Thus, both HEU and HU cohorts were enrolled from similar communities in Nairobi at the same study site. We selected HEU and HU infants with similar growth and maternal STI history. These criteria led to only healthy infants of both groups being included in the study presented here. We did not find a correlation between the diversity measurement and the health status of the infants, monitored for up to 2 years after birth. In addition, this study could not identify a correlation between viral load and diversity scores in HEU infants. We predict a higher ratio of infants showing TCR clonotype expansion in HEU infants with increased morbidity.</p><p id="Par29">An advantage of this study is the great similarity of the samples when it comes to other socio-economic factors or HIV treatment. A significant limitation in interpretation of most studies of HEU children is the influence of antiretroviral therapy, which mothers receive during pregnancy and/or infants receive in the weeks after birth. It is known that antiretroviral drugs are able to cross the placental barrier with different efficiencies depending on the specific drug, and that this perinatal drug exposure causes changes in blood composition including immunological relevant populations like T cells and neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. This confounding factor was excluded from this study by using ART treatment-naïve samples. In addition, the selection of mother-child sample pairs with identical health data at birth and similar epidemiological data within the first two years of life, such as data on infection types and number of infections, was aimed at eliminating further confounding factors. At the same time, the different sampling year may have led to minor differences between the HEU and HU group.</p><p id="Par30">Technical factors, such as long-term storage or the HIV infection itself must be considered as confounding factors as well. While the HIV infection of mothers of HEU infants is an inherent characteristic of this sample group, the impact of the duration and conditions during long-term cryopreservation was assessed by measuring RIN scores. In fact, different RIN scores were measured between the samples of the HEU and HU infant groups, and samples of the HU group showed lower RIN scores than HEU samples. It is likely that the lower RIN scores of HU samples were caused by conditions during long-term storage or transport. However, we conclude that the lower RNA quality had a uniform effect across all TRB sequences, leading to lower reading depth in HU samples but did not introduce any bias regarding the diversity measurements. This conclusion was supported by the observation of similar TRBV expression patterns between HEU and HU cord blood samples and by comparison with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Additionally, our focus on clonotypes of higher rank based on frequency (top 200 analysis) ensured that an effect caused by RIN scores within the HU group was minimized.</p><p id="Par31">Finally, it should be noted that the T cell receptor repertoire of most T cells is defined by the combination of T cell receptor alpha (TRA) and TRB chains. The determination of the T cell receptor repertoire based on TRB sequences thus has certain limitations. However, the analysis of the combination of TRA and TRB chains is only possible by using newer technologies which are based on single cells. At present, these technologies are still very costly and their use can only be justified by a significant gain in knowledge. For this study sequencing of TRB sequences alone was favored over the sequencing of TRA/TRB combinations, which remains to be a common method for determining T cell diversity.</p><p id="Par32">Our data indicate that the adaptive immune repertoire of an unborn child can be shaped by maternal chronic HIV infection.
