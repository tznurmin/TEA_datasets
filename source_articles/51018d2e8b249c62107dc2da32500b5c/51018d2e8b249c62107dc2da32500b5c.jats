However, in patients’ heart and lung, viral protein has not been detected. In mouse models, heart disease has not been reported. EV71-infected brainstem is generally believed to be responsible for the cardiopulmonary collapse. One major limitation in EV71 research is the lack of an efficient oral infection system using non-mouse-adapted clinical isolates. In a robust oral infection NOD/SCID mouse model, we detected EV71 protein at multiple organs, including heart and lung, in 100% of moribund mice with limb paralysis. Infiltrating leukocytes were always detected in heart and muscle, and VP1-positive M2 macrophages were abundant in the lung. Functional dissection on the pathogenesis mechanism revealed severe apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines, and abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) in orally infected hearts. Therefore, cardiopulmonary disease could be one plausible cause of death in this mouse model. Inoculation of EV71 through an oral route resulted in viral infection in the intestine, viremia, and EV71 appeared to spread to peripheral tissues via blood circulation. Infectious virus was no longer detected in the blood on day 5 post-infection by the plaque formation assay. We demonstrated that both EV71 clinical isolate and cloned virus can target the cardiopulmonary system via a natural infection-like oral route.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (Ministry of Science and Technology of

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Epidemics of enterovirus 71 (EV71 or EV-A71) occurred frequently worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In a recent outbreak in Shanghai, China, near 1000 deaths of children were reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Infection with EV71 in children is associated with a wide range of severity, including hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, tachycardia (135–250 heartbeats per minute), cardiopulmonary failure, and death. EV71 is closely related to poliovirus, hepatitis A, and coxsackievirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, another close relative of EV71, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), is emerging as a global infectious disease, particularly in North America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In the 2014 outbreak, at least 2000 cases of EV-D68 were reported from 20 countries worldwide. EV-D68 is also associated with severe respiratory disease and acute flaccid paralysis. Altogether, reemerging non-polio enterovirus represents a new major threat to the public health. While formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine will be clinically available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, current treatment for enterovirus remains supportive, and no FDA-approved therapeutics for EV71 is currently available on the market.</p><p id="Par3">Sudden death and cardiopulmonary collapse are most common in fatal cases of EV71 infection. It is generally believed that mortality is due to neurogenic pulmonary edema and cardiac decompensation from CNS infection, inflammation, and the consequent sympathetic hyperactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, middle). Although there are data for encephalomyelitis, no experimental evidence for viral myocarditis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. MRI studies on cardiopulmonary failure cases showed hyperintensity of the posterior aspect of the medulla<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) on cardiac echography of patients were found to be lower than the average of normal children. Pulmonary edema of fulminant EV71 infection was found to be very well correlated with left ventricular dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. One critical issue here for human patients is whether heart and lung can be directly attacked by EV71 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, right panel), or whether the sole cause of cardiopulmonary failure is the sympathetic hyperactivity from the CNS infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, middle).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Infection kinetics of EV71 RNA and plaque forming activity in multiple organs in orally infected NOD/SCID mice.

However, mouse-adapted strains accumulated many artificial mutations during serial passages through the mouse brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, they no longer can faithfully represent the parental clinical isolates from patients. In the model of hSCARB2 transgenic mice, a Japanese Isehara strain of EV71 was used for oral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, the oral infection efficiency in this model was low (2/50). Oral infection with clinical isolates of EV71 (10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> pfu/mouse) was reported at a moderate efficiency around 15–40% in immunodeficient AG129 mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Recently, a robust oral infection system was established in the NOD/SCID mouse model. Approximately 71% of orally infected mice developed paralysis and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To date, efficient oral infection with EV71 clinical isolates (non-mouse-adapted) can be conducted only in the immunodeficient NOD/SCID mouse model.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, by using the more efficient oral infection system of NOD/SCID mice, we detected EV71 specific protein VP1, viral RNA, and infectivity by plaque forming assay in multiple organs, with near 100% frequencies of VP1 and viral RNA in heart and lung of moribund mice. Massive infiltration of leukocytes can be detected in both tissues. Abundant VP1-positive macrophage (M2 type) and pneumocytes (type I and type II) were also observed in the infected lung tissue. Using an intraperitoneal (i.p.) route in the 3-day old NOD/SCID mice, we also identified viral VP1 protein in both heart and lung. Infected cardiomyocytes lost the normal pattern of connexin 43 (a gap-junction channel protein). Intriguingly, functional electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed abnormal electrophysiology in 70–100% of orally infected moribund mice, but not in i.p.-inoculated moribund mice. Furthermore, severe apoptosis was also detected in 70% of cardiomyocytes of orally infected moribund mice, and only less than 20% in i.p. infected moribund mice. Except for one mouse, we have so far detected no VP1 protein in the brain and spinal cord. In our oral infection model, there was no apparent difference in the cardiopulmonary pathogenesis between cloned virus F6 and uncloned clinical isolate F23 (quasispecies), despite their different degrees of sequence divergence (Materials and Methods). Our results demonstrated, for the first time, that the cardiopulmonary failure could originate directly from EV71 infection, inflammation and pathogenesis in the heart and lung in this oral infection model. The potential mechanisms of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the route of virus spreading from gut to heart and lung are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Infection kinetics of EV71 in multiple organs in orally infected NOD/SCID mice</title><p id="Par6">EV71 is mainly transmitted via an oral-fecal route in natural infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Because cardiopulmonary collapse is a fatal cause in severe cases of EV71 infected children, we examined the tissue distribution of EV71 in an oral infection mouse model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Three-day-old NOD/SCID mice were inoculated orally with cloned EV71-F6 virus at 10<sup>7</sup> pfu/mouse. This cDNA clone from clinical isolate of EV71-F6 has been shown to be infectious <italic>in vitro</italic> by RD cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> by i.p. injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). In general, approximately 50% of the orally infected NOD/SCID mice developed limb paralysis on 12–14 dpi, moribund status on 16 dpi, and death on 17–19 dpi (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C,D</xref>). A survival curve and the clinical score are summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>. In a time course experiment (before, during, and after disease onsets), we examined the infection kinetics of EV71 in the cardiopulmonary system (heart and lung), CNS (brain and spinal cord), GI tract (intestine and feces), and paralyzed limb muscle. EV71 specific RNA and plaque forming activity were extracted from dissected tissues (Materials and Methods), and measured by qPCR and <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of RD cells, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E–K</xref>). In general, clearance of viral infectivity appeared to occur much earlier than the clearance of viral RNA. For example, except for the CNS, plaque forming activity were detected in all tissues examined before disease onset (before 12 dpi), and remained detectable only in lung and muscle at the stage of disease onset (around 12–14 dpi), but undetectable in all tissues after onset (after 16 dpi). In contrast, we observed no significant decrease or clearance of viral RNA in all tissues at all stages before sacrifice of the infected mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Tissue distribution of VP1 protein in orally infected mice</title><p id="Par7">In addition to the viral RNA and pfu activity, we examined viral protein VP1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, including heart, lung, muscle, and liver (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Multiple organs from the moribund mice were found positive at near 100% incidence. In contrast, except for one case in the brain (1/9), no VP1 was ever detected in the CNS and intestine. Kidney showed an intermediate incidence rate for VP1 (33%). Strong signals of VP1 can be identified in cardiomyocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, upper panel), and loss of the normal morphology or the muscle-characteristic striated pattern was observed in some heart sections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, lower panel). In the lung sections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), VP1-positive signals can be identified in the center of alveoli (black arrow) and in lung epithelial cells (white arrow). VP1 signals were also detected in kupffer-like cells near central vein (CV) in the liver (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Hindlimb muscle sections revealed VP1-positive muscle bundles, massive leukocyte infiltration, and histopathological changes in the muscle morphology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). A swollen and distorted muscle cell appeared to have lost the characteristic striated pattern, and its centralized nuclei (solid arrow) indicated muscle regeneration in response to injury. In kidney, VP1 signals were occasionally detected in the glomerulus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). In only one exception, we detected VP1 signal in cerebellum (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Tissue distribution of EV71 in orally infected NOD/SCID mice.

We proposed here that EV71 might initially infect leukocytes and macrophages in the intestine of orally infected mice, and was spread to multiple organs, including muscle, heart and lung by blood or lymphoid circulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). This hypothesis is based on the following: (1) Viral RNA and infectious virus (pfu) can be detected in the intestine and feces (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1H,I</xref>). The trend of increasing viral RNA in the time course of infection suggests that EV71 could be proliferating somewhere in the intestine (e.g., Peyer’s patch), despite the lack of detectable VP1 protein signal by IHC in the intestine sections from moribund mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). (2) Previously, it was reported that human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL1) on the leukocyte membrane could serve as an entry receptor of EV71<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. EV71 was also shown to <italic>in vitro</italic> infect human PBMC and a monocytic THP cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. (3) Leukocyte infiltration was observed in both heart and lung in the orally infected mice (Figs <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). In addition, VP1-positive M2 type macrophages were abundant in lung alveoli (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). Since M2 macrophage is supposed to be more immunosuppressive, they probably played a role in dampening the inflammation in the infected lung. (4) VP1-positive macrophages in the liver (Kupffer cells) were found clustering around the central vein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). In addition, VP1-positive signals were present in the kidney glomerulus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>), suggesting that EV71 could spread from intestine to liver and kidney through the blood circulation. (5) It is very common to observe muscle infection with EV71 in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, myositis in humans has not been reported. In this study, we also detected VP1 and pathology in the hindlimb skeletal muscle (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). It is possible that muscle could serve as an intermediate reservoir of EV71 during the spreading from gut to heart and lung. We observed very abundant amount of VP1, viral RNA, and pfu in hindlimb muscle (Figs <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). In the neural spread hypothesis of poliovirus, muscle appeared to serve as a reservoir before invading the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. (6) We detected viremia in the blood samples at the earlier stage (4/4 at 1 hr post-infection; 8/9 at dpi 1), but diminished EV71 titers at the later stage (3/10 at dpi 3; 0/7 at dpi 5) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">Clinically, in 7 out of 7 (100%) autopsied heart samples with left ventricular dysfunction, cardiomyocyte apoptosis was always observed, albeit no viral protein was ever detected in these human heart samples at the autopsy stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. One striking phenomenon in our current oral infection model is the very severe apoptosis in 100% of infected moribund animals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C–G</xref>).

Although some of these EKG abnormalities can be found in infections with either coxsackie virus or EV71, the pattern of a split P wave (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B,E</xref>) appears to be unique to EV71, since it has not been observed before in the coxsackie virus literature.</p><p id="Par19">Interestingly, coxsackie virus persistent in murine or human hearts was shown to contain a 5′ terminal deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In our previous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and current studies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we observed in various tissues significant discrepancy between the amounts of viral RNA (by RT-PCR) and infectious viruses (by pfu). It is possible that in all these cases, defective interfering particles could be generated in the infected hearts.</p><p id="Par20">In contrast to the highly efficient oral infection model, EKG abnormality is very rare in mice i.p.-inoculated at the same age (3-day-old) (Figs <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>; Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the experimental group by the i.p. route, VP1 protein can always be detected by IHC in their hearts and lungs with or without arrhythmia. However, the numbers of apoptotic nuclei in orally infected mice were around 70%, while i.p. infection observed only approximately 20%, and the saline control was around 2% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Apoptosis was detected previously in EV71 infected cell culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. So far, it has not been reported in literature whether cardiomyocytes can be infected by EV71 <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>; and if so, whether infected cardiomyocytes can undergo apoptosis. We demonstrated here for the first time that massive apoptosis can be detected in the heart orally infected with EV71 clinical isolates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C–G</xref>). Because around 70% of cardiomyocytes are TUNEL-positive (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>), and only less than 3% of cardiomyocytes are VP1-positive in the same mouse (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), we attributed the apoptosis mechanism as due to pro-apoptotic cytokines released by the infiltrating leukocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>), rather than directly caused by EV71-encoded protein 2B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Indeed, inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IFN-γ, and IL-1β, can be detected in both heart and lung by ELISA or RT-qPCR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A,B</xref>). Because IL-6 expression in the heart peaked on dpi 8, and declined to undetectable level before disease onset of limb paralysis on dpi 12, it is unlikely that IL-6 is associated with apoptosis detected in moribund mice after disease onset on dpi 16. Expression of STAT-1 and IFN-γ is known to play a critical role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Here, in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, IFN-γ coincides with disease onset. In this NOD/SCID model without mature T cells, one major source of IFN-γ could be the NK cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. In addition, IL-1β is well known to be associated with the development of heart disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Expression of IL-1β coincides with the cardiomyocyte apoptosis detected at the moribund stage (Figs <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). It warrants further investigation whether the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated after disease onset in the infected heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Because we detected no TNF-α nor caspase 1 activation in our orally infected cardiomyocytes at the moribund stage, it is less likely that the apoptosis phenomenon here is related to pyroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Altogether, oral infection with EV71 cloned virus F6 in this neonatal mouse model caused severe cardiomyocyte apoptosis and various EKG abnormalities mimicking human heart diseases. In contrast, i.p.-infected mice died earlier (8 dpi vs. 16 dpi) and presented only mild arrhythmia and moderate apoptosis at the moribund stage. We speculate that the cause of death of i.p.-infected mice is not related to cardiopulmonary collapse. Instead, one plausible cause of death of these i.p.-infected mice could be related to limb paralysis and starvation.</p><p id="Par22">Most studies in this paper were performed using the cloned F6 virus. However, single-strand RNA virus is known to exist in nature as a heterogeneous quasi-species due to the more rapid mutation, recombination, adaptation, selection, and evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. It is therefore a legitimate issue whether all the experimental results here simply reflect an idiosyncracy of the clonal nature of EV71-F6. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, EKG abnormality was always observed in mice infected with either uncloned F23 clinical isolates or F6 cloned virus, despite the fact that the cloned F6 is far less sequence heterogeneous than the F23 clinical isolate (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). In our previous oral infection using the clinical isolate F23, we observed a survival rate around 30% using 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Here, we obtained a survival rate around 60% using the cloned EV71-F6 strain at 10<sup>7</sup> pfu/mouse. Because of the differences in viral strains (F6 vs. F23) and titers (10<sup>7</sup> vs. 10<sup>8</sup>), we cannot interpret here whether the difference in the survival rates between F6 and F23 is solely due to the difference in sequence divergence or heterogeneity. Further investigation should be warranted to address the significance of EV71 quasispecies in virus spread, virulence, drug resistance and evolution.</p><p id="Par23">In summary, by oral infection with EV71, we detected viral RNA, VP1 protein and plaque forming activity in cardiomyocytes. Such orally infected hearts also exhibited leukocyte infiltration, inflammatory cytokines, severe cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and abnormal EKG patterns. This phenomenon is reminiscent of heart failure in fatal acute human myocarditis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par24">All animal experiments were conducted using protocols approved by Academia.
