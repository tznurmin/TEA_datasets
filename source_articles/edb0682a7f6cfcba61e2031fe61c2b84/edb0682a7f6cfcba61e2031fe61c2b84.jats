Plant natural products (PNPs) are especially important targets because of their utility as flavors, fragrances, and medicines, but can be challenging to synthesize due to stereochemical complexity. PNPs are produced via specialized plant metabolism involving numerous enzymes from diverse classes that enzymatically transform central metabolites into secondary metabolite compounds such as the analgesic morphine and antimalarial artemisinin. Many PNPs are obtained from processed plant biomass, requiring substantial land, water, and time investment, and which introduces insecurity in supply chains due to variability in crop yields resulting from pests or extreme weather. Furthermore, intermediates in a PNP biosynthetic pathway are often unavailable from the host plant, thus complicating efforts to produce novel derivatives of the PNP of interest. Microbial production of PNPs can overcome these challenges by enabling (1) on-demand production capabilities associated with microbial cells, (2) scalable and controlled production in fermentation facilities, and (3) the capacity to produce PNPs and PNP intermediates at higher purity or yield than those provided by the native plant host. In addition, microbial production of PNPs can serve as a discovery platform to synthesize novel derivatives of PNPs and gain insight into enzymes involved in plant secondary metabolism.</p><p id="Par4">Metabolic engineering to produce a particular PNP relies on iterative engineering cycles of design, build, and test referred to as the DBT cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. At the level of the host, DBT includes selection and engineering of the host to overproduce PNP-precursor metabolites in sufficient quantity; at the pathway level, a biosynthetic route to produce the PNP is determined and candidate enzymes are tested or discovered; and at the enzyme level, protein engineering may be warranted to improve function or produce derivative compounds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Metabolic engineering at multiple levels has enabled engineering of increasingly complex heterologous PNP pathways. <bold>a</bold> Heterologous production of a PNP in a microbial host can involve engineering at three different scales: host, pathway, and enzyme. <bold>b</bold> Timeline of examples of notable yeast-produced PNPs, showing increasing pathway length accomplished over time.

Indeed, the complexity of PNP pathways being discovered and engineered has steadily increased over the past 20 years (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), highlighted by a recent example of a 25-enzyme pathway for the anticancer compound noscapine reported in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Once a strain has been developed that produces a small amount of the desired product, strategies to engineer that strain for industrial-scale titers of the product can then be employed; these strategies have been reviewed elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and the focus of this review will be on initial engineering strategies producing at least detectable concentrations of the desired PNP and/or novel PNP derivative which verify pathway viability. Heterologous PNP biosynthesis and application of DBT require judicious selection and engineering of the production host, the biosynthetic pathway, and the individual enzymes composing the pathway. In this review we discuss recent examples and technologies that enable engineering of hosts, pathways, and enzymes to make PNPs and novel PNP derivatives and the technological advances on the horizon that are expected to further accelerate this field. In the coming years, we expect researchers to increasingly employ metabolic and protein engineering to solve a range of ever more complex biosynthetic challenges.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Identifying and engineering a suitable host organism</title><p id="Par6">A PNP may be selected as a metabolic engineering target for a variety of reasons including medicinal utility, industrial application, or scientific interest. For a given PNP, the first step towards heterologous production is selection of an appropriate host species in which to engineer the pathway. Within a species, use of previously developed strains that overproduce necessary metabolites can greatly accelerate progress. And lastly, within a given strain, preliminary engineering of the host prior to incorporation of heterologous enzymes can facilitate implementation of the non-native pathway in a new context.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Selecting the host species for a heterologous plant pathway</title><p id="Par7">When selecting a host species for a heterologous pathway, properties such as ease of cloning, ease of culturing, and suitability of the host for the new enzymes and compounds are considered. Organisms with a long history of use in research, and particularly in metabolic engineering, often have well developed techniques for cloning, culturing, and industrial scale-up that make them attractive choices.</p><p id="Par8">A first choice of host for production of PNPs may be plant cells, where plant specific subcellular compartments and protein processing are conserved, a topic recently reviewed elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Indeed, model plants such as <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> are useful for transient expression of plant pathway enzymes during preliminary testing and discovery, as enzyme function, necessary cofactors, and substrate pools are likely to be maintained in planta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However genetic manipulation of plants, even well-established model plants, remains unwieldy and slow compared to microorganisms and thus a microbial host is often preferable. Microorganisms such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have a wealth of well-established tools available for genetic manipulation, are easily cultured, have a range of developed platform strains available (see following section, “Selecting a host strain that overproduces PNP precursors”), and are amenable to production scale-up. Other microorganisms are often employed to purposes which evolution has made them especially well-suited: <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is often used for the production of antibiotics originally derived from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> is widely used for the high-titer production of amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>; <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> is frequently employed when using lipids as a substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Yet for most applications involving the production of PNPs in a microbial host, <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is employed.</p><p id="Par9">Thus, the most immediate question for a metabolic engineer seeking to produce a compound in a heterologous host is often whether to use <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Distinct advantages of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are its ease of genomic integration, owing to a high rate of homology directed recombination, and that as a eukaryote yeast contains many organelles found in plants. Some enzymes from PNP biosynthesis pathways, such as cytochrome P450s, are transmembrane proteins and require the presence of an appropriate membrane, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), for proper anchoring and folding. This potential roadblock was demonstrated during the Semi-synthetic Artemisinin Project, a landmark achievement in metabolic engineering in which <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was engineered to produce high titers of artemisinic acid, a precursor to the important antimalarial artemisinin. In this project, both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were considered as potential hosts, and while impressive titers of the intermediate amorphadiene (25 g/L) were achieved in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the subsequent step in the pathway is carried out by P450<sub>AMO</sub>, a plant cytochrome P450. High activity of this enzyme could not be attained in <italic>E. coli</italic> necessitating a switch to production in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. While strategies exist to modify transmembrane proteins for function in the cytosol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, using <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a host for pathways containing transmembrane proteins avoids the added labor necessary to modify those enzymes. Furthermore, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contains cellular microcompartments (e.g., mitochondria and peroxisomes) that can be used to mimic the subcellular localization employed in PNP biosynthesis in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Conversely, <italic>E. coli</italic> has a doubling time that is 3–4 times shorter than <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, is well suited to very high expression of enzymes, and has a different profile of native metabolites available compared to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. For example, the presence of a native pathway for certain isoprenoid compounds was used to engineer <italic>E. coli</italic> strains with 2,400-fold higher production of taxadiene (a precursor to the PNP drug taxol) compared to strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> engineered for taxadiene production.</p><p id="Par10">One additional avenue when choosing a host organism for PNP biosynthesis is to utilize multiple organisms in a co-culture with components of a metabolic pathway split between distinct organisms of the same or different species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Merits of this approach include reducing burden on the host from the heterologous pathway, the ability to utilize the species most suited to expression of specific enzymes in the pathway, and modularity associated with being able to mix pathways by growing distinct strains together. In one example, benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) were synthesized in an <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> co-culture system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. <italic>E. coli</italic> were engineered for biosynthesis of the branchpoint intermediate (<italic>S</italic>)-reticuline, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains were engineered to express membrane-bound P450 enzymes that derivatized (<italic>S</italic>)-reticuline to other PNPs. In another example, high titers of an anthocyanin PNP were achieved by splitting the metabolic burden of the pathway across four <italic>E. coli</italic> strains which were co-cultured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Limitations of co-cultures are pathway specific and include inefficiencies in the transport and/or diffusion of intermediate metabolites between cells in the co-culture and the need to balance growth of multiple hosts in as single culture, which may differ in optimal growth conditions and rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Selecting a host strain that overproduces PNP precursors</title><p id="Par11">Following selection of a host species, engineering the host to increase titers of native metabolites that are biosynthetic precursors to the product of interest can greatly facilitate downstream production of PNP molecules. The core metabolic networks of model organisms are well-characterized and can be used to guide overexpression and knockout modifications for overproduction of central metabolite precursors and to address common challenges (e.g., feedback inhibition or other metabolic regulation). One of the advantages of biosynthesis over chemical synthesis is how readily biosynthetic strains are distributed; once a strain has been engineered to produce a compound, researchers looking to expand on that work in the future need not repeat tedious syntheses of starting material.</p><p id="Par12">Strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that overproduce alkaloids, fatty acids, terpenes, and other valuable compound classes have been engineered (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Platform strains that overproduce central metabolites or a heterologous secondary metabolite can both be useful: central metabolites, such as geranyl pyrophosphate or amino acids, provide a starting point for the production of potentially thousands of diverse PNP compounds, while secondary metabolites can provide an easy starting point from which to engineer biosynthesis of a specific PNP product. For example, platform strains that produce the key branch point alkaloid <italic>(S)</italic>-reticuline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> have enabled microbial biosynthesis of a wide range of BIAs produced by <italic>Papaver somniferum</italic> (opium poppy), including morphine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and noscapine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Likewise, strictosidine producing strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> provide a key branch point metabolite for the biosynthesis of monoindole alkaloids (MIAs), which include vincristine, ibogaine, yohimbine, and thousands of others.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Common platform strains<sup>a</sup></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2019_9848_Figa_HTML.png"/></p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Examples of engineered strains producing different compounds or compound classes that can be used as platform strains for the production of diverse downstream compounds.

This is demonstrated by the engineering of an efficient simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) strain for bioethanol production in <italic>E. coli</italic> which utilizes lignocellulosic biomass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, an inexpensive waste product from agriculture and forestry, in place of expensive refined sugars. In another example, an enzyme was designed that allows for assimilation of formate into central metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, potentially allowing the biosynthesis of medicines and commodity chemicals from formate, which is expected to be abundantly available from electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>. Lastly, researchers generated a strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> that can produce its own biomass from CO<sub>2</sub> via photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Although there is significant interest in utilizing natural photosynthesizing microorganisms (e.g., cyanobacteria) for the production of PNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, it could be advantageous to engineer the ability to fix CO<sub>2</sub> in well studied, genetically tractable industrial microorganisms such as <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. While the aforementioned strains have not yet been used for the production of PNPs, the other PNP-producing strains discussed throughout this review could potentially be integrated into these platforms to produce complex PNPs de novo from agricultural waste, formate produced with renewable energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, or directly from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. This principle has been demonstrated through the engineering of <italic>E. coli</italic> to utilize the one-carbon feedstock methanol and ultimately convert it into the flavanoid naringenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Such strategies could support more sustainable bioprocesses for producing increasingly diverse products, including PNPs, at industrial scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Engineering host metabolism to facilitate PNP biosynthesis</title><p id="Par14">After selection of a host or existing platform strain, the supply of biosynthetic precursors may be enhanced by modifications to the host, such as gene deletions, swapping of endogenous enzymes with more active homologues, or overexpression of endogenous metabolic genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A recent <italic>tour de force</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> combined all of these techniques to reprogram yeast central metabolism to overproduce acetyl-CoA for isoprenoid and fatty acid biosynthesis - molecules which are a starting point for many PNPs such as the antimalarial artemisinin. A model of the yeast reaction stoichiometries for acetyl-CoA, redox cofactors, and sugar was used to determine a more favorable reaction stoichiometry, which was defined as having a reduced ATP requirement, reduced loss of carbon to side reactions, and improved pathway redox balance. The optimal acetyl-CoA stoichiometry was implemented by augmenting acetyl-CoA biosynthesis with expression of four enzymes involved in acetyl-CoA biosynthesis in other organisms, allowing the yeast to produce 25% more of the isoprenoid farnesene with an equal supply of sugar while requiring less oxygen, an important consideration for oxygen-constrained industrial fermentation environments.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Common host engineering strategies to increase titer of a PNP precursor compound.  Yellow triangles,  core metabolite platform; blue hexagons, secondary metabolite platform</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2019_9848_Fig2_HTML.png"/></p></fig></p><p id="Par15">Optimization for tyrosine and <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid overproduction, from which many PNPs including some alkaloids, polyphenols, and flavonoids are derived, has also been pursued in the context of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. For example, researchers engineered yeast producing 1.9 g/L of <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid through a combination of six genetic modifications to yeast native metabolism. These included engineering feedback-resistant enzymes, over-expressing enzymes at bottlenecks, and removing competing side pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">Deletion of competing or undesired side pathways in the host is a common strategy to increase precursor titers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In work on the de novo production of strictosidine, a plant-derived alkaloid, researchers monitored biosynthetic intermediates in their engineered pathway to identify competing side pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Finding that geraniol, an intermediate in strictosidine biosynthesis, was metabolized by the yeast through esterification, deletions were made to ATF1 and OYE2 which reduced undesired host interactions and resulted in a 6-fold increase in strictosidine production.</p><p id="Par17">Finally, evolution has emerged as a powerful approach for host optimization, although it has not yet been directly applied to PNP biosynthesis. In the aforementioned work on altering yeast metabolism from alcoholic fermentation to lipogenesis, researchers also employed laboratory evolution methods to improve lipogenic growth on glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Deletion of pyruvate decarboxylase genes (PDC1, 5, and 6) involved in alcoholic fermentation resulted in strains unable to grow on glucose as a carbon source. Adaptive laboratory evolution was applied to evolve FFA producing strains lacking ethanol fermentation for growth on glucose by gradually shifting the carbon source from ethanol to glucose over 200 generations.

In engineering a heterologous yeast strain for the production of morphine and its semi-synthetic derivatives, researchers observed substantial accumulation of the undesired side product neomorphine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Neomorphine accumulation results from activity of codeinone reductase (COR) on the direct product of T6ODM, neopinone, prior to a spontaneous double bond shift.

The localization strategy ultimately increased morphine titers by sevenfold while decreasing production of the undesired intermediate neomorphine by fourfold. Engineering spatial organization of enzymes can also be accomplished through the use of synthetic scaffolds, which can increase product titers through enzyme clustering or increased local substrate concentration.

In plants, monoterpene biosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts and plant monoterpene synthases typically contain N-terminal plastid targeting sequences (PTSs) of 20–80 amino acids which are cleaved to yield mature protein. In the absence of PTS cleavage, enzyme function is decreased. The researchers tested truncated linalool synthases using bioinformatic and structural information to predict the PTS sites for removal. In one instance, truncation of the PTS motif resulted in a 15-fold improvement in linalool titers. In the same work, additional enzyme engineering was carried out on HMG-CoA reductase, a key rate-limiting step in the pathway for monoterpene biosynthesis.

Since natural products are often large and complex, an enzyme which natively performs the desired transformation at high efficiency may not be available. However, protein engineering can be used to expand the substrate scope of existing enzymes to accept larger substrates, as has been demonstrated for cytochromes P450<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>, halogenases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>, and aminotransferases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>, to name only a few classes. Through similar efforts, type III polyketide synthases have been engineered to produce novel and often larger products by accepting novel substrates and performing additional chain elongation steps prior to cyclization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup>. Given the large effort traditionally required for protein engineering and metabolic engineering, though, relatively few examples in which the two techniques are successfully combined have been reported. In light of advances that have accelerated both and furnished a wealth of engineered enzymes and pathways with which to work, we can expect to see the two utilized in concert increasingly in the future. For example, a recent perspective discussed valuable drugs that could be produced by leveraging opioid biosynthetic <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains with engineered enzymes and subsequent semi-synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>; these include the pharmaceuticals cisatracurium, levorphanol, and butorphanol.</p><p id="Par43">To date, metabolic pathways have been more frequently modified with natural enzymes. For example, in work on the combinatorial biosynthesis of the bacterial metabolite rebeccamycin in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, researchers identified 21 additional genes known to modify the bisindole core and predicted that combinatorial expression of those enzymes could access to a total of 540 bisindole derivatives, 98% of which have not yet been reported in PubChem. Early concrete demonstrations of addition of derivatizing enzymes to metabolic pathways mostly utilize pathways in their native host, rather than in heterologous hosts. For example, researchers added a halogenase to the marine bacterium <italic>Streptomyces coeruleorubidus</italic>, which natively produces pacidamycin, in order to produce the new-to-nature derivative chloropacidamycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>. The researchers used the introduced chlorine as a synthetic handle for cross-coupling reactions to make a range of novel products. While the two preceding examples are of bacterial natural products, the strategies could readily be applied to PNP pathways expressed in microbial hosts. In a notable achievement, researchers reported the integration of two halogenases into the medicinal plant <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> and observed that chlorinated catharanthine alkaloids were produced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup>. Both of the preceding examples rely on the halogenation of tryptophan, an early intermediate in the pathway; in <italic>C. roseus</italic>, 7-chlorotryptophan accumulation was observed in the plant and suspected to adversely affect the growth rate. To alleviate this, researchers engineered RebH to act on tryptamine, the immediate downstream metabolite in the biosynthetic pathway, rather than on tryptophan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup>; integration of this engineered RebH variant showed no accumulation of 7-chlorotryptophan. More recently, researchers engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> to produce resveratrol, a stilbenoid produced by several plants, and then added the halogenase Rdc2 to produce 2-chlororesveratrol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref></sup>. This work utilized a heterologous pathway in an industrial microorganism with an additional enzyme introduced to produce a new-to-nature natural product derivative, albeit with a relatively simple chemical structure. Given the dramatically more complex PNPs that have been biosynthesized heterologously in recent years, future demonstrations of non-native enzyme incorporation will furnish increasingly synthetically complex novel products.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion and future directions</title><p id="Par44">The past 20 years of PNP metabolic engineering have seen increasingly sophisticated pathway engineering, with engineered pathways composed of two to seven enzymes in the early 2000s progressing to pathways containing 20 or more enzymes at present. The more enzymatic steps in a heterologous pathway, the more formidable the challenge for construction of the pathway, discovery of the requisite enzymatic components, and overcoming interdependencies introduced between the many enzymatic steps. Taken at face value, this should mean that long, complex PNP biosynthetic pathways take significantly longer to engineer than simple pathways. However, recent years have seen the rapid implementation of long pathways as a result of advances in DNA synthesis, sequencing, and genome engineering. These enabling technologies, along with the emergence of PNP platform strains, have allowed the discovery and engineering of increasingly long PNP pathways.</p><p id="Par45">Following these trends, the field of metabolic engineering leverages sequencing and synthesis to more rapidly discover pathways and enzymes and engineer those pathways into metabolic hosts. Decreasing costs of high-throughput sequencing continue to allow comprehensive profiling of plant genomes and transcriptomes, providing plentiful putative enzyme targets that can be mined via comparison with existing databases of enzymes of known function. Inexpensive DNA synthesis enables wholesale synthesis of dozens of predicted enzymes for any given step in a pathway. This approach has the advantage that hundreds of hypothesized enzymes can be tested for a given step as opposed to testing individual enzymatic hypotheses in planta. Platform strains producing important metabolites for a given specialized PNP pathway will be used to screen single enzymes and combinations of predicted enzymes to reconstitute partial metabolic pathways. Importantly, once a platform strain for a given intermediate is made, the discovery and assembly of downstream pathways are greatly facilitated.</p><p id="Par46">Throughout this review, we have highlighted instances in which protein engineering was employed to solve challenges (e.g., low activity, product inhibition, and poor functioning in new host conditions) encountered during the reconstruction of metabolic pathways in heterologous hosts. As the design-build-test cycles associated with both metabolic engineering and protein engineering have been greatly accelerated in recent years, we expect to see protein engineering employed more frequently during the construction of heterologous metabolic pathways. Although these cycles have accelerated, engineering enzymes for altered small-molecule production still relies on screening, typically via LC or GC, rather than selection, resulting in a disproportionate amount of project time required for sample analysis, even for limited library sizes. One exciting means to engineer selections for small molecules is through the use of genetically-encoded biosensors linking concentration of a compound of interest to an output such as fluorescence-protein expression or cell fitness. Protein and RNA biosensors can be engineered to recognize a range of small molecules and control genetic output accordingly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref></sup>, and early examples have demonstrated their application in enzyme evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref></sup>. As methods for developing biosensors improve we anticipate that they will be increasingly employed in enzyme engineering to explore wider ranges of sequence space more rapidly than traditional screening methods allow. Furthermore, we expect protein engineering to be used to solve a wider range of problems in the future—not only to adapt existing enzymes to their new conditions, but also to develop completely novel activities which fill in gaps in biosynthetic pathways or expand pathways in new directions for the production of novel PNP derivatives. This will allow existing and future heterologous biosynthetic pathways to be leveraged for the production of innumerable valuable and novel chemical entities. As metabolic engineering accelerates towards increasingly complex and tailored pathways in the coming years, we expect protein engineering to become an increasingly dominant force for the production of known and novel molecules on both the research and industrial scales.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Benjamin Kotopka for valuable feedback in the preparation of the manuscript.
