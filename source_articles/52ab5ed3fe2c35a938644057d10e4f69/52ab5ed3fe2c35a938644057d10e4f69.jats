Dairy cattle may be moved between farms over long distances, and hence understanding the route and frequency of the movements is essential to establish the pattern of spread of BTB between farms, which could ultimately help to inform policy makers to design cost effective control strategies. The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the network structure of dairy cattle movement and its influence on the transmission and prevalence of BTB in three emerging areas among the Ethiopian dairy belts, namely the cities of Hawassa, Gondar and Mekelle.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A questionnaire survey was conducted in 278 farms to collect data on the pattern of dairy cattle movement for the last 5 years (September 2013 to August 2018). Visualization of the network structure and analysis of the relationship between the network patterns and the prevalence of BTB in these regions were made using social network analysis.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The cattle movement network structure display both scale free and small world properties implying local clustering with fewer farms being highly connected, at higher risk of infection, with the potential to act as super spreaders of BTB if infected. Farms having a history of cattle movements onto the herds were more likely to be affected by BTB (OR: 2.2) compared to farms not having a link history. Euclidean distance between farms and the batch size of animals moved on were positively correlated with prevalence of BTB. On the other hand, farms having one or more outgoing cattle showed a decrease on the likelihood of BTB infection (OR = 0.57) compared to farms which maintained their cattle.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">This study showed that the patterns of cattle movement and size of animal moved between farms contributed to the potential for BTB transmission. The few farms with the bulk of transmission potential could be efficiently targeted by control measures aimed at reducing the spread of BTB. The network structure described can also provide the starting point to build and estimate dynamic transmission models for BTB, and other infectious diseases.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bovine tuberculosis transmission</kwd><kwd>Contact network analysis</kwd><kwd>Ethiopia</kwd><kwd>Scale free</kwd><kwd>Small world</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the Department for International Development, the Economic &amp; Social Research Council, the Medical Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council and the Defence Science &amp; Technology Labora</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">ref: BB/L018977/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>James L.

Cattle are the dominant species constituting 70–90% of the Ethiopian livestock producing households, and accounting for about 72% of the meat and 77% of the milk produced annually in the country, indicating its overriding role in generating smallholders’ income and in meeting domestic meat and milk consumption requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. At present, about 98% of the Ethiopian dairy cattle are of the Zebu breed and managed under extensive farming in agro-pastoral and pastoral systems. However, rapid urbanization is placing challenges to meet the demand for food (including dairy products) from an increasing population. The milk production potential of Zebu cattle is poor and as a result the possibility of meeting the increasing demand for milk and its products using the Zebu breed is minimal. Due to this situation, the Ethiopian Government, in its economic development strategy, has prioritized improvement of the breed of dairy cattle, pasture development and intervention on animal health to cope with the increased demand of milk and other livestock products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The breed improvement plan focuses on breeding crosses of Holstein Friesian (HF) (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) and Zebu (<italic>Bos indicus</italic>) breeds mainly by using artificial insemination services through synchronization wherever possible. Animals produced through cross breeding will have an added advantage of resilience to harsher environments in addition to increased milk production and dairy cattle productivity. Thus, the dairy development is of paramount importance particularly for the provision of employment opportunities (especially for women), poverty alleviation, and improvement of human nutrition and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As a consequence of these development efforts, intensive dairy farms and smallholder farms raising HF crosses are increasing in and around major urban centers.</p><p id="Par20">The dairy farming is relatively well-developed in central parts of the country although it has also become an emerging sector in the peripheral regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The demand for the improved breed of dairy cattle for stocking of the emerging and/ or expanding farms in the peripheral regions is met mainly by the purchase of cross bred dairy cattle from the central areas of the country. However, the central part of the country has a high prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The centrifugal trade of dairy cattle from areas with higher prevalence of BTB to areas with lower prevalence poses a high risk of transmission into the peripheral areas where much lower disease prevalence have been recorded in the diary sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Prevailing conditions such as developing infrastructures, national development plans etc., favor trade of cattle from long distances. Nevertheless, it has been well documented that animal movement within and between animal populations is a central driver of disease spread as pathogens can be transmitted over long distances via movement of infectious animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Understanding the structure of cattle movement networks and exploring the trade routes, volumes and frequency of dairy cattle movement in the Ethiopian conditions can inform how BTB and other infectious disease could potentially spread in the country. Studies on the impact of cattle movement networks and the associated risk of BTB transmission are lacking in Ethiopia. In the United Kingdom, movement of dairy cattle was estimated to be responsible for up to 84% incidence rate of BTB in herds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In recent years social network analysis has become a tool of choice to link movement networks with transmission and dynamics of infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although the application of social network analysis for studying disease transmission has not been common in developing countries, several studies have been conducted in Europe including the network analyses of the initial phase of the 2001 foot and mouth disease epidemic in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the transmission of infectious disease in sheep population in the Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and the spread of BTB and its control in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The main challenge in developing countries including Ethiopia, though suggested for more informed disease control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], is a lack of animal identification, registration and traceability system in which data regarding cattle movement is recorded. While data scarcity and quality issues remain a problem, possible efforts to better understand the existing conditions need attention. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand the network structure using available cattle movement information, identify relevant network properties and explore associations with the epidemiology of BTB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Centrality measures</title><p id="Par21">Analysis of the established network due to dairy cattle movement within the study sites identified 278 farms/sites as nodes and 584 connections (cattle movement records dated between September 2013 and August 2018) as edges.

Each farm was observed to have a median link of 1 (range: 0 to 37) with other farms, as measured by the degree centrality. This was found to be consistent across all sites. The outdegree centrality for any of the node in the full network was also observed to show a median of 1 while the indegree showed a median of 0 but fewer farms had higher number of incoming connection (range: 0 to 29). These centralities in the full network were found to correlate negatively (Spearman correlation, r = − 0.25). Higher level of farm centrality due to closeness was observed in the full network indicating requirement of only very fewer steps (average 0.01) to access every other farm from a given farm in the network. In this regard, Gondar showed higher level of farm centrality compared to other sub-networks. Fewer farms were observed to show a higher betweenness of up to 299 connections although majority of them showed very little or no potential as explained by the median value of betweenness centrality.

A minimum of six steps were required for connecting the two most distant reachable farms in the network, as measured by the network diameter. Visualization of the path of the network diameter showed that it began from farm ID 9F011 and ends at farm ID 9F003, all the farms along the path being located in Hawassa only. In the full network, the assortativity measurements based on degree centrality showed that farms with higher degree centralities tend to preferentially connect with farms of lower degree centrality measures, and the tendency was found to be stronger for Gondar (− 0.32) as compared to that of either Mekelle (− 0.04) or Hawassa (− 0.01). Network centralization based on degree centrality demonstrated that the sub-network in Gondar was more centralized although the overall network showed more of decentralized tendency (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">The average of the local clustering coefficient of each farm (called the global clustering coefficient) for the full cattle movement network was 0.13 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The average shortest path length for the full network was 1.96 which means very few steps could be required for a farm to access other farms in the network. To ascertain whether the full network displayed a small world structure, the values of average shortest path length and clustering coefficient were compared with that of the random network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Accordingly, the random network showed a much lower clustering coefficient (0.01, about 13 times lower) and higher average shortest path length (8.5) proving that the established cattle movement network was highly clustered and efficient to reach out quite easily, showing that the real network displayed a small world structure. Considering the geographic Euclidean distance between the source and end farms (range: 0.02–709 km), 49% of the distances among farms were below 5 km, and only about 8% of the distances were greater than 300 km, showing that cattle movement in most instances were localized and it was only in few cases that cattle were moved from distant places (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold> Degree and Euclidian distance distributions of dairy cattle movement network.

Higher correlation (r = 0.83) was observed between closeness and eigenvector centralities, while weaker correlation (r = 0.24) was observed between eigenvector and betweenness centralities and thus applied to detect critical farms in the network. Accordingly, three dairy farms with farm ID’s 7F020 from Gondar, 9A038 from Hawassa, and 8F007 from Mekelle, were identified as critical, serving both pulse taker’s and gate keeper’s roles within their respective sub-networks. The identified critical farms were considered as the nucleus for the structural functionality of the sub-networks, in fact they were essential in connecting part of the sub-networks that would otherwise be isolated. A couple of farms were also recognized to serve as either pulse taker’s or gate keeper’s role in Hawassa and Mekelle; however, no farm was observed to function either of the roles in Gondar. In the full network, farm ID 7F020 (from Gondar) served both the attributes of pulse taker’s and gate keeper’s function but none of the remaining farms showed no role for the functionality of the full network (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cohesive analysis</title><p id="Par28">The dairy cattle movement network was organized in 4 core sub-groups of k: 3, 2, 1 and 0 with size of 9, 89, 126 and 53 nodes, respectively (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Figure S2). Among the farms involved in the network, there were 63 GWCC, 53 of which contained only one node, the remaining components contained between 2 and 204 nodes. However, the network has no giant strong connected component. A measure of the quality of community structure in the dairy cattle movement network was determined in terms of the modularity, estimated at 0.72 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), indicating higher tendency of intra-community connections than the same community structure would present if the connections would be rewired under random network. Community detection based on greedy optimization algorism identified 73 communities within the connected network. The largest community involved 46 farms while the smallest had one farm. Three of the top largest communities contained 119 farms, accounting for 43% of the farms in the network, while the remaining 57% of the communities had between 1 and 20 farms per community. Distributions of communities in majority of the cases were restricted to the study sites but there were crossing of few communities between regions/sites. Fewer farms in Gondar and Mekelle had connections with farms in Hawassa and thus communities involving such farms were observed to cross over.

Removal of farms based on their betweenness is the first to fall outside the random targeting simulation envelope but then out performed by in-degree, out-degree and eigenvector centrality.

Removal of about 24% (50/150) of the farms in the network could reduce the size of the GWCC by more than 85% (174/204).

Farms with higher indegree tend to have lower outdegree suggesting the absence of farms which are both likely to become infected and to transmit infection playing an important role in facilitating BTB transmission within the network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

The increase due to incoming connectivity could be due to the purchase of infected cattle from farms which did not know the BTB status of the animal and thus the buyer took the risk by chance, or rarely, fewer infected farms might sell reactor animals hiding the BTB status instead of culling since there is no policy in the country enforcing them not to do so. This can further be corroborated by supplemental data that cattle sourced from other farms/sites showed significantly higher level of BTB infection than the preexisting ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Whereas, the decrease of positivity on farms with outgoing connections showed the impact of prompt removal of reactor animals from the herd; and repeated skin testing and removal of reactors could help to create apparently BTB clean farm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In addition to the links, batch size has also been evidenced to relate with BTB infection of a farm. This study found that farms introducing a batch size of ≥2 cattle showed an increased likelihood of BTB positivity compared to farms which introduced one animal or not introducing at all. This is in line with previous suggestion that restricting the number of traded dairy cattle could prevent BTB transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Although nearly half of the moved cattle were sourced from within 5 km distances (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), cattle sourced from distant origins showed more likelihood of BTB infection suggesting the risk of BTB spread through cattle traded/moved from far areas. This was in line with the trend of dairy cattle movement following the government’s dairy expansion plan where cattle moved from the central parts of the country where the dairy sector was well developed but with high BTB prevalence.

Previous studies of infectious disease epidemics on scale free network demonstrated faster epidemics spread due to the presence of hubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Higher-order relationships between farms in the full network shows negative assortative mixing suggesting that highly connected farms tend to connect with less connected farms, and this relationship was found to be stronger in Gondar compared to that either in Hawassa or Mekelle, demonstrating the potential in accelerating BTB spread within their respective sub-networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Frequent connections between highly and less with well-connected farms have been substantiated to slow the spread of infectious disease as compared to networks with positive assortative relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Negative assortative relationship as observed in our networks can be beneficial for BTB control, since implementing control measures such as movement restriction, culling and /or increased biosecurity measures to highly connected farms protects less connected farms attached to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Disintegration of giant connected components and biggest communities restricts the spread of infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Targeted removal of farms in the cattle movement network to fragment its cohesiveness can be considered as an effective strategy to identify farms playing vital role in disease transmission and impose effective disease control measures such as implementation of movement restriction, vaccination or diagnostic testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In this regard, the present data suggested that targeting on the top 5% of highly connected farms based on their eigenvector value would reduce the cohesiveness of the network by nearly 35% (as explained from the fragmentation of the GWCC), and if we increase the target to 15% of the connected farms then the cohesiveness would be reduced considerably (reduce by greater than 75%). Targeted removal based on the eigenvector value also showed good effect on fragmentation of the biggest community but this is at lower rate compared to the effect on GWCC as a measure of network resilience. Fragmenting the network cohesiveness relatively quickly suggests that the rate at which BTB spread among farms in the network could be restricted. Targeted removal of farms based on eigenvector values signifies that targeted interventions could be one possibility for disease control. However, the effectiveness may be progressive for BTB due to its chronic nature and take longer period to recognize the intervention impact compared to acute infections. Thus, the control efficacy can be enhanced if targeted intervention is combined with other control measures such as implementation of good biosecurity measures, movement restriction from BTB endemic areas, reduce the number of traded cattle, segregation and culling of skin test positive animals.</p><p id="Par41">In this study, the information used for the network analysis was based on the recall of the respondents due to absence of recording system. However, possible verifications were made by involving other family members, animal attendants who had stayed at the farm for longer period and local extension workers who closely support the farming system. The analysis was made focusing mainly on cattle movement. Other possible pathogen transmission pathways such as movement of other species of animals, people and vehicles, neighborhood, sharing of bulls and facilities were not considered. Characterization of the cattle movement network is not an easy task especially in developing countries where there is no proper recording system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">This paper provides a first estimate and quantitative description of the cattle movement patterns between dairy herds in Ethiopia and suggests that control interventions could be targeted to achieve a greater impact. Assessing the relative impact of alterative control strategies such as test-and-slaughter, vaccination and movement restrictions will require the development of dynamic transmission models. This data provides the starting point to build and estimate such models for BTB, and other infectious diseases, in Ethiopia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study sites</title><p id="Par43">The study was conducted in three selected cities of Ethiopian regional Governments namely Hawassa, Gondar, and Mekelle (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The cities were purposively selected due to the fact that the dairy industry has been rapidly growing in these areas in accordance with the Ethiopian Government long term plan to expand the dairy industry to achieve the need of animal sourced nutrition in these areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hawassa represents the southern, Gondar the northwestern and Mekelle the northern emerging dairy belts of the country with the number of herds (animals) of more than 200 (5200), 440 (4800) and 260 (2600), respectively. These cities are densely populated with a human population size of about 0.3 Million in each city [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

Researchers described the objective of the study to the respondents before forwarding any of the questions to ensure that the feeling and mood of participants was good. Data were collected using a pretested questionnaire addressing specific questions on dairy cattle movement including number of cattle, batch size, purpose and date of movement (September 2013 to August 2018). Information was collected from farm owners and/or farm managers. To optimize the memory of the respondents the researchers assessed the history of each animal through focused conversation with the respondent walking within the barn where cattle were kept. The interview was made in such a way that respondents would feel secured about all information provided. Data on tuberculin testing and other pertinent animal level data were collected in parallel with the questionnaire survey.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Herd classification based on tuberculin test</title><p id="Par45">Herds were classified as infected or non-infected to BTB based on Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Tuberculin (SICCT) test. Herds were classified as infected when at least one animal was found positive in the herd. We followed standard interpretation as described in OIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], where we considered a skin reaction as positive if the increase in skin thickness at the bovine site was more than 4 mm greater than the reaction shown at the site of the avian injection measured after 72 h of injection. SICCT test is known to have high diagnostic specificity (99.98%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] but imperfect (and variable) sensitivity (75–95.5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]). The SICCT test is considered more reliable as a herd level test rather than as an individual animal test - hence we examine how network characteristics relate to herd level risk where we have a relatively higher confidence in the ability of the test to classify infected and non-infected herds. However, this work acknowledges the possibility of misclassifying herds with low prevalence of BTB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>The network topology and metrics</title><p id="Par46">Aggregates of cattle movement data were used to construct a directed static network. Farms from which cattle were sourced from or to which cattle were destined to go, were considered as nodes and cattle movements between farms as links or edges. The overall network topology was checked for small world or scale free structures, as both do have important roles in determining the nature of epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]). The definition of a small world network is one where the clustering coefficient is significantly higher and the average shortest path length lower than that computed from a random network of equivalent magnitude i.e. the same number of nodes and links as the real network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Similarly the network is considered scale free when the degree distribution follows a power law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Node centralities relevant as possible targets for disease control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] were calculated by the indegree, outdegree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvectors. The indegree and outdegree centralities refer the number of incoming and outgoing cattle moves, respectively. Betweenness measures the frequency with which a farm is located on the shortest path length between pairs of other farms; and eigenvector centrality measures the degree to which a farm is connected to other well connected farms. The degree distribution was assessed following the guidelines described by Clauset et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The network topology was described by using various network level metrics, including network diameter, average shortest path length, density, assortativity, clustering coefficients, modularity and network centralization. Node and network level metrics considered for the analyses were adapted as defined in Motta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], Dubé et al.

Identification of such important farms was made based on a correlation analysis between node centrality measures.

K-core decomposition allows identifying the core and periphery of the network<bold>.</bold> The largest connected components within the network, namely the giant strongly connected component (GSCC) and giant weakly connected component (GWCC) of the network were identified. The GSCC is the sub-group of nodes in which a node could be reached from every other node considering the directionality of links, whereas the GWCC is the sub-group of nodes for which directionality of the connections was disregarded. Further subsets of networks within the giant connected components that were more connected to each other than to the rest of the network were also identified using a greedy optimization community detection algorithm<bold>.</bold></p><p id="Par50">Vulnerability of the cohesiveness of the network structure due to targeted removal of farms was assessed using percolation analysis. This analysis examines the impact of progressively removing farms one after the other in the descending order of a given centrality measure on the structure of the network.
