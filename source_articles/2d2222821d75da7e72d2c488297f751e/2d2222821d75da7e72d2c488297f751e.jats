Blood culture-based diagnostics usually requires 1–2 days for identification of bacterial agent and an additional 2–3 days for phenotypic determination of antibiotic susceptibility pattern. With the escalating burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rapid diagnostics becomes increasingly important to secure adequate antibiotic therapy. Real-time whole genome sequencing represents a genotypic diagnostic approach with the ability to rapidly identify pathogens and AMR-encoding genes. Here we have used nanopore sequencing of bacterial DNA extracted from positive blood cultures for identification of pathogens, detection of plasmids and AMR-encoding genes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to gather the above-mentioned information from nanopore sequencing and conduct a comprehensive analysis for diagnostic purposes in real-time. Identification of pathogens was possible after 10 minutes of sequencing and all predefined AMR-encoding genes and plasmids from monoculture experiments were detected within one hour using raw nanopore sequencing data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the correct identification of plasmids and <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> subtypes using <italic>de novo</italic> assembled nanopore contigs. Results from this study hold great promise for future applications in clinical microbiology and for health care surveillance purposes.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2020_Article_64616.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Bloodstream infections (BSIs) and sepsis are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Epidemiological data are scarce, but a recent estimate indicated that 31.5 million cases of sepsis and 5.3 million sepsis attributable deaths occur annually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This estimate is only based on data collected from high-income countries, and it therefore likely underestimates the true burden of disease worldwide, especially in low-and-middle-income countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Most studies on sepsis and BSIs report an increasing incidence over the last two decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, particularly among the immunocompromised, multimorbid, and elderly patients, or due to failure of empiric antibiotic regimens as result of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">With multi drug resistant pathogens spreading at an alarming rate, widely adopted empirical antibiotic treatment regimens for sepsis based on penicillin (or aminopenicillin) in combination with gentamicin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> are being challenged. In particular, the escalating burden of infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram negative bacteria represents a major health concern. These bacteria, mainly <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, are not only resistant to all penicillins and third generation cephalosporins, but also frequently express co-resistance to gentamicin. Consequently, treatment failure may occur, and clinicians increasingly prescribe last-resort antibiotics such as carbapenems as initial antibiotic treatment of sepsis. This in turn contributes to development and spread of AMR and to a further increase in the burden of infections caused by resistant bacteria.</p><p id="Par4">Current state-of-the art in diagnostics of BSIs is blood culture, which often takes 1–3 days to come out positive and provide information on etiological agent. Time to positivity is influenced by a number of clinical and microbiological factors such as source of bacteraemia, level of bacteraemia, presence or absence of pre-administered antibiotics and the bacterial species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is becoming widespread in clinical microbiology laboratories to identify bacteria by analysis of pelleted blood-cultures when they are flagged as positive by the blood culture incubation system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) however, requires subculture on solid media overnight for colonies to form, and an additional 18+/−2 hours of subculture incubation with antibiotic discs to obtain a result which can be interpreted according to official breakpoint guidelines and converted to sensitive (S), intermediate (I) or resistant (R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Until then time-point choice of antibiotic treatment is based on clinical assessment, empirical guidelines and local epidemiology on AMR. However, several studies have observed that inappropriate antibiotic treatment is often initiated to patients with BSIs and this is associated with increased mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Diagnosis of BSI and prescription of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial for the reduction of morbidity and mortality caused by BSI and WHO and Centers for Disease Control aim for a two hour turnaround time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For these reasons there is a growing interest and an urgent need for the development of molecular techniques for rapid identification of pathogens and AMR from blood and blood cultures. The topic has been extensively reviewed elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and the currently available methods can be categorized in three groups; <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization-based methods, DNA-microarray-based methods, nucleic acid amplification-based methods (such as PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)), and combinations of these. Common to all these techniques is that detection is limited to a predefined set of genetic targets, either specific for a particular pathogen or an AMR-encoding gene. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) on the other hand, provides comprehensive genomic information and can potentially detect all AMR-encoding genes present in the bacterial genome. Additionally, WGS-data provide vast opportunities for bacterial sequence typing, phylogenetics and virulence analysis. The introduction of the real-time sequencing platform from Oxford nanopore technology (ONT) has triggered studies to explore its application in blood culture diagnostics, either based on 16 s amplicon sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, or by a whole-genome-sequencing approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This represents an unbiased approach to diagnostics with the potential to identify any pathogen and AMR-encoding gene.</p><p id="Par6">Here we present results from rapid blood culture diagnostics based on extraction of bacterial DNA from positive blood cultures followed by nanopore sequencing and real-time data analysis for identification of pathogens, detection of plasmids and AMR-encoding genes. The results have also been verified through WGS using short-read Illumina sequencing and hybrid assembly using nanopore and Illumina sequences. This proof-of-concept study represents a molecular-genetic approach to diagnosis of BSIs which can provide clinicians with detailed information on etiologic agent and AMR within few hours of a blood culture becoming positive.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Blood culture samples and nanopore sequencing</title><p id="Par7">Seven blood cultures spiked with <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> positive <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>mecA</italic> positive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, or a combination of these were analysed.

By rapidly providing clinicians with bacterial pathogen identification and alerting them to the presence of clinically relevant AMR-encoding genes, this can contribute to early optimization of antibiotic therapy. Firstly, such an approach can save lives by triggering a change in antibiotic treatment in cases where inadequate therapy is given. Secondly, when established and validated further, this approach may contribute to early de-escalation of broad-spectrum therapy and antibiotic stewardship when no clinically relevant AMR-encoding genes are detected. Genotypic sequencing-based blood-culture diagnostics therefore represents a promising supplement to conventional phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing.</p><p id="Par24">In this study, we have shown that by use of the first 4000 raw sequencing reads, which become available after approximately 10 minutes of real-time sequencing, we can identify pathogens with a high degree of certainty. However, results obtained with Centrifuge (which is also utilized by the ONT analysis software WIMP) and search by BLAST differed substantially. Centrifuge is a very rapid tool for the classification of DNA sequences from microbial samples, which uses an indexing scheme optimized for the metagenomic classification. Here we have used the bacteria, archaea, virus and human indexing scheme for Centrifuge, which is derived from the NCBI Reference sequences (RefSeq) database. For the BLAST searches we used the NCBI Reference Prokaryotic (RefProk) database, which only contains prokaryotic genomic data. For this reason, human sequences are only recognized with the former approach. Using Centrifuge 4.3% of <italic>E. coli</italic> A2-39 reads were classified as <italic>S. enterica</italic>, and around half of these reads mapped to different plasmids (one third mapped to the IncHI2 plasmid), while the rest mapped to the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome. Since these sequences were correctly assigned to <italic>E. coli</italic> by the RefProk database search, possibly some of this <italic>E. coli</italic> genomic information is lacking in the indexed Centrifuge database, or misclassification is caused by the Centrifuge algorithm. The misclassification of the plasmid-sequences by Centrifuge highlights how mobile genetic elements may pose a challenge to sequence-based identification of bacteria. Bacterial identification should primarily be based on chromosomal gene content. Centrifuge also assigned reads from the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> A2-37 experiment to three different subspecies of <italic>Klebsiella</italic>; <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>K. quasipneumoniae</italic> and <italic>K. variicola</italic>, whereas BLAST search against RefProk classified 100% of reads as originating from <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. Also, these reads were classified correctly as <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> when using BLAST search against the RefSeq database, indicating that the misclassification was potentially due to the Centrifuge search or indexing algorithm and not the RefSeq database.</p><p id="Par25">For our monoculture experiments, classification by BLAST against RefProk assigned 100% of reads correctly for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, whereas for the four <italic>E. coli</italic> experiments a slight proportion (from 3.1% to 9.3%) where assigned to <italic>Shigella spp</italic>. The distinction between <italic>Shigella spp</italic>. and <italic>E. coli</italic> is a well-known challenge to clinical microbiology since they share many biochemical, phenotypic and genetic properties. <italic>Shigella</italic> is widely believed to have evolved from <italic>E. coli</italic> and the genus <italic>Shigella</italic> comprises several clusters interspersed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> phylogeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

These pathogens were selected because they are among the most frequently isolated bacteria from BSIs. Furthermore, the ESBL phenotype of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and the MRSA phenotype of <italic>S. aureus</italic> are spreading globally at an alarming rate and are on the World Health Organization’s list of priority pathogens for which new antibiotics is urgently needed. In our monoculture experiments these target AMR-encoding genes were detected within the first hour (10–59 minutes) of sequencing. By conventional microbiological methods the presence of ESBL or MRSA would not have been detected until 1–2 days later, a delay which in the setting of BSIs can be fatal. We have also shown that, for most of the samples one to five hours of sequencing was enough to cover 95% of the target species genome. Also, even when more than half of the generated reads were of human origin, eight hours of sequencing was enough.</p><p id="Par27">For mixed cultures the sequencing-based approach performed well when bacteria were present in approximately equal amounts, but for the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> experiment, where there was a 4-log difference in bacterial concentration in favour of <italic>E. coli</italic>, identification of both bacteria and AMR-encoding genes was challenging.

Diagnosing mixed infections, however, is also problematic using conventional microbiological methods. Analysis by MALDI-TOF of pelleted blood-cultures is often unsuccessful in these cases, and overnight sub-cultures on solid culture-media are required for identification from bacterial colonies.

However, by use of <italic>de novo</italic> assembled nanopore contigs we can correctly identify both plasmids and <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> subtypes, thereby increasing the precision level substantially. This approach, possibly in combination with rapid bacterial sequence typing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> harbours great potential for future health care surveillance purposes. For Illumina the time taken from DNA extraction to normalized library was ~5.5 hours when using the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit as opposed to ca. 3 hours needed for Nanopore library preparation. The additional time to be used for the sequencing by synthesis is very much dependent on the read length and in our case with a maximum read length of 2 × 300 bp, a runtime lasted about 56 hours. Although we kept MinION runs for up to 68 hours, the crucial difference between these two platforms is that in case of Nanopore sequencing, the data become available in real-time, whereas in case of Illumina, one has to wait until the end of the sequencing run. We are aware of very few studies which have applied nanopore whole genome sequencing for blood-culture diagnostics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Recently, Sakai <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> applied multiple samples on each flow cell by use of barcoding and collected sequencing data for 30 minutes, thereby obtaining 100–3000 reads per sample only. Analysis was done using the ONT analysis software WIMP, which utilizes Centrifuge. The authors report the top three bacteria with the highest read count, and the species with the most assigned reads was used for diagnosis. This approach performed well for Gram negative bacteria but performed poorly for Gram positive bacteria. The study supports the feasibility of rapid nanopore-based identification of pathogens from blood cultures with a minimum of laboratory requirements. Based on our data however, we believe this approach does not generate enough data per isolate for reliable detection of all relevant AMR-encoding genes present in the sample.</p><p id="Par29">It should be possible to develop a bioinformatic analysis pipeline that assembles nanopore data as they become available, performs plasmids search and AMR search against a database of clinically important AMR-encoding genes, and alerts the clinical microbiologist to important findings with very high precision. To implement such an approach in a routine clinical microbiology laboratory the development of a graphic user interface is a necessity, with the most basic information regarding bacterial identity and AMR presented in an easy-to-read fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. More advanced analysis of virulence factors, sequence types, phylogeny and plasmids would require bioinformatic skills. With the rapid development of sequencing-technology, computational power and bioinformatic tools, we believe that such an approach may be the future of routine analysis in clinical microbiology. Furthermore, costs of sequencing are decreasing steadily and flow cells suitable for on-demand sequencing of bacterial genomes have reached the market. Currently, the price per Flongle flow cell, which according to the manufacturer can deliver up to 1–2 gigabytes of data, is $90 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://nanoporetech.com/" ext-link-type="url">https://nanoporetech.com/</ext-link>). By use of barcoding it should be possible to analyse several samples per flow cell, thereby reducing sequencing-costs to a level that is comparable to other molecular tests which are available in many routine microbiology laboratories.</p><p id="Par30">In conclusion, we have shown that with a sequencing-based approach to blood culture diagnostics it is possible to identify pathogens and specific AMR-encoding genes using raw nanopore sequencing data, obtained within four hours after a blood culture is flagged as positive by the incubation system. Identification of pathogens was possible after 10 minutes of real-time sequencing, and all predefined AMR-encoding target genes and plasmids from the monoculture experiments were detected within one hour (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrate correct identification of plasmids and <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> subtypes using <italic>de novo</italic> assembled nanopore contigs.
