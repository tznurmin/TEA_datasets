The basis of their pathogenicity is the injection of effector proteins into the host using a type III secretion system (T3SS) to remodel plant immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Though few effector proteins are conserved among pathogens that infect hosts from different kingdoms, the YopJ effector family of gram-negative bacteria has been well characterized in a number of different pathogens. YopJ originally derives its name from <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, the causative agent of bubonic plague, and from <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic>, which causes Izumi fever in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Though its putative structural fold suggests the protein being a cysteine protease, it has been biochemically established that YopJ is an acetyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In mammals, acetylation by YopJ suppresses immune signaling through targeting kinases within the MAPK pathway. Acetyltransferase activity has also been reported for other members of the family, among them HopZ1a from <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and AvrBsT from <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pv <italic>vesicatoria</italic> (Xcv)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. HopZ1a interferes with cytoskeleton stability and jasmonate signaling, as suggested by its reported acetylation of tubulin and JAZ proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. AvrBsT has been shown to acetylate ACIP1, a microtubule-associated protein that is involved in pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI), as well as AvrBsT-induced effector-triggered immunity (ETI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In plants, ETI is often associated with the hypersensitive response (HR), leading to rapid cell death of the infected region and preventing further spread of the pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The bacterial counter-strategy is to impede such response by suppression of HR, which happens through other effector proteins and intrinsic plant components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The putative plant phospholipase AtSOBER1 was reported to suppress AvrBsT-elicited HR in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> through its suggested phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) activity. AtSOBER1 has thus been proposed as a negative regulator of phosphatidic acid accumulation, which occurs upon AvrBsT activity during infection, suggesting AvrBsT and AtSOBER1 are involved in lipid homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, the reported in vitro PLA<sub>2</sub> activity of AtSOBER1 was compared to <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> acyl-protein thioesterase 1, an enzyme with a reportedly poor reaction rate (<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> = 2.1 mM) on lysophosphatidylcholine, a generic PLA<sub>2</sub> substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, an earlier study demonstrated AtSOBER1’s preference for short acyl chain <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenyl esters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The suggested link between AtSOBER1 and the group of acyl-protein thioesterases is rather vague. The latter are mainly known from their human isoforms APT1 and APT2, which catalyze the depalmitoylation of the oncogene Ras<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Both APTs and AtSOBER1 are members of the large group of α/β hydrolases and share a sequence identity of 33%. Nevertheless, α/β hydrolases, although sharing a common fold, can develop quite distinct biochemical activities due to the high flexibility of their core architecture. Their protein fold allows for insertions, deletions and a relatively flexible position of the catalytic triad residues, which are located on loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The biological significance of SOBER1 activity in plant species other than <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and in the context of other YopJ effector proteins is unknown. Furthermore, AtSOBER1’s enzymatic nature is uncertain, because only limited information can be obtained by sequence homology and inconsistent results were published. Therefore, we conducted a thorough structural, biochemical, and in vivo study that involves several members of the esterase family. We solved the crystal structure of AtSOBER1 and carried out biochemical and physiological studies of several AtSOBER1 related proteins suggesting deacetylation as the molecular basis of HR suppression against YopJ effectors. In addition, we identified a loop segment acting as a lid structure in acyl-protein thioesterases, which turns out to be the major factor determining product turnover in this class of enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Crystal structures of AtSOBER1 and ZmB6T1C9</title><p id="Par4">A phylogenetic analysis of plant acyl-protein thioesterases reveals two major clades featuring distinct and conserved blocks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). To elucidate the molecular features encoded by these conserved elements, we solved the crystal structures of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> SOBER1 and <italic>Zea mays</italic> B6T1C9, each representing a different clade in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Both proteins fold into a canonical α/β hydrolase architecture and superpose with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions of 1.54 Å over 210 amino acid residues.

Most differences between the two proteins encode for minor structural features, such as an elongated helix and an additional beta strand. Furthermore, a two-amino acid insertion into a loop segment results in a functional alteration of the substrate binding site, splitting the protein family into two different classes of hydrolases.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Phylogenetic and structural analysis of plant hydrolases reveals two major protein clades. <bold>a</bold> Phylogenetic tree of related plant hydrolases. <bold>b</bold> Multiple sequence alignment highlighting conserved sequence blocks within the clades. <bold>c</bold> Superimposition of AtSOBER1 (gray) and ZmB6T1C9 (black) showing the structural elements encoded by those blocks in the same colors</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2017_2347_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></p></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title><italic>Zea mays</italic> B6T1C9 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> acyl-protein thioesterase</title><p id="Par5">Classical acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) feature an active site accessible to the solvent and adjacent to a hydrophobic tunnel for accommodation of fatty acids attached to their protein substrates.

We found one insertion (L63) to directly block the entrance to the tunnel. The insertion of the second-amino acid (P64) pushes the following residue (F65) into the tunnel, which is positioned in the middle of the hydrophobic tunnel and could act as a hydrophobic anchor for the lid. The two amino acid insertion is conserved within the entire family clade (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), well aligning with the leucine at the tunnel entrance and the phenylalanine in the center of the tunnel, the latter of which is in most cases a phenylalanine or a leucine. To investigate the enzymatic consequences of the insertion and the mechanistic architecture of the lid, we subsequently conducted a series of Michaelis–Menten experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Leu63 provides a surface for deacetylation</title><p id="Par8">We obtained Michaelis–Menten parameters for hydrolysis of different <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl esters by AtSOBER1.

In contrast to Kirik and Mudgett (2009), we were unable to detect any phospholipase 2 activity of AtSOBER1 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">3</xref>). To test for the importance of L63 for deacetylation, we constructed a L63A mutant of AtSOBER1 and analyzed its structural and biochemical properties. While wild type AtSOBER1 features a shallow binding groove for the acetate, with a protein surface provided by the side chain of L63 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), the crystal structure of the L63A mutant showed a massively changed surface, with the hydrophobic tunnel now opened up right behind the active site (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). While the mutant protein was still an active enzyme, we discovered that its substrate specificity was now reversed: We examined the mutant in kinetic studies and found its <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> to <italic>p</italic>NP acetate weakened by about 40-fold compared to wild type.

Furthermore, we tested the L63A mutant in tobacco leaves and found the protein to be compromised in AvrBsT-elicited HR repression.

We found B-factors of the loop as low as the rest of the protein in AtSOBER1, and increased B-factors in the acyl-protein thioesterases APT1 and ZmB6T1C9/ZmAPT2. This indicated that in AtSOBER1 all protein parts retained a similar rigidity, whereas in APT1 and ZmB6T1C9/ZmAPT2 the loop had a higher flexibility than the rest of the protein. To investigate if loop flexibility is directly dependent on the strength of the hydrophobic anchor, we designed a mutant, in which we substituted the phenylalanine, which is the most hydrophobic amino acid on the Hoop-Woods scale, with a leucine (AtSOBER1 F65L). While the mutant crystallized in the same space group and cell dimensions, we found the loop B-factors significantly increased when compared to wild type AtSOBER1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a–e</xref>), indicating that its flexibility had improved just by changing the residue that anchors the loop inside the hydrophobic tunnel.

For <italic>p</italic>NP butyrate (C4), valerate (C5), and hexanoate (C6), we measured increased catalytic efficiencies after introducing a weaker anchor (AtSOBER1 F65L) and a decrease in AtTIPSY1 L110F (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f,</xref> Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">1</xref>d). The observed differences in catalytic efficiencies for those C4–C6 chains are mostly resulting from higher or lower turnover numbers rather than significantly different substrate affinities (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). This suggests that the strength of the hydrophobic anchor determines the flexibility of the lid-loop and that a more flexible loop leads to a significant increase in product release.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Role of SOBER1 in HR repression is conserved in <italic>Brassicaceae</italic></title><p id="Par12">Since AtSOBER1 and BnSOBER1 show common biochemical characteristics, we tested <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>B. napus</italic> isoforms in their ability to suppress AvrBsT-elicited HR in tobacco.

The lid-loop does not only regulate the substrate turnover rate but also determines protein family and cellular function. We found that a specific arrangement of the loop results in a unique hydrophobic anchor mechanism creating a previously unknown family of protein deacetylases that catalyze the molecular basis for suppression of HR induced by YopJ effector proteins. We furthermore found that SOBER1’s biological function is not restricted to <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and not limited to suppress HR induced by AvrBsT. Previous studies identified AtSOBER1 as the enzyme responsible for suppression of <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> AvrBsT-triggered HR in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Due to contradicting biochemical data and a lack of structural information, the underlying biochemical reaction catalyzed by AtSOBER1 remained questionable. Moreover, the biological significance of AtSOBER1 activity in plants other than <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and in the context of other YopJ effector proteins was uncertain. We elucidated the catalytic machinery of AtSOBER1, which identified a family of undescribed deacetylases but also revealed important information about the molecular mechanism of acyl-protein thioesterases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Acyl-protein thioesterases are present in all domains of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. They feature an active site accessible to the solvent with an adjacent hydrophobic tunnel. Accessibility to the tunnel is crucial for their function and any disturbance can change substrate specificity as shown for the putative third human acyl-protein thioesterase, which turned out to have a function divergent from its paralogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, acyl-protein thioesterases do not display any obvious lid structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. It remained unclear how substrate specificity and product release would be organized within the protein. In this study, we assessed the structural features that distinguish a previously unknown family of deacetylases from acyl-protein thioesterases, to which the former group has high-sequence identity. We found that a loop constituting the hydrophobic tunnel lid is the major component determining substrate turnover rate and substrate specificity. These findings have direct implications into the catalytic machinery of acyl-protein thioesterases, for which the loop segment turns out to retain the function of a lid. Our study also demonstrates the relative ease with which such lids can be altered to create a different type of hydrolase. The SOBER1 sub-family has incorporated such an alteration that makes deacetylation the preferred reaction catalyzed by the protein. The structural information we obtained allowed us to create a mutant (AtSOBER1 L63A), with impaired ability to deacetylate, but is still a functional enzyme with increased activity on longer substrates. In agreement, this mutant protein is compromised in suppression of HR <italic>in planta</italic>. Taken together with the structural and biochemical data we obtained, this highly suggests deacetylation as the underlying reaction for HR suppression by SOBER1. Our attempts to turn a SOBER1 protein into a TIPSY1 protein by altering the hydrophobic anchor (AtSOBER1 F65L) were a partial success. Weakening the anchor allowed the protein to hydrolyze <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenyl hexanoate, like AtTIPSY1 is able to. AtSOBER1 F65L also displayed higher affinities to longer-chain substrates and the lowest affinity to <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenyl acetate, a pattern opposite to wild type. However, this is not entirely reflected in the catalytic efficiencies due to an almost unaltered turnover rate of <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenyl acetate and, although diminished, AtSOBER1 F65L does not reach the even lower affinity of AtTIPSY1 to <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenyl acetate. Therefore, despite a major contribution of the hydrophobic anchor, we believe that additional protein features exist that mechanistically distinguish SOBER from TIPSY1 proteins, possibly located in the close vicinity of the lid-loop or in the substrate binding site of the proteins. Future studies, including a crystal structure of a TIPSY protein, will hopefully be able to answer this question. Nevertheless, we expect these results to significantly aid the development of small molecule inhibitors for SOBER1 by targeting both the acetate binding site, as well as the loop anchor mechanism inside the hydrophobic tunnel. Such compounds could be used as plant defense supporting molecules, making important crops and biofuel resources carrying <italic>SOBER1</italic> homologs less susceptible to pathogenic bacteria. In addition, as demonstrated by our in vitro and in vivo studies, fine-tuned SOBER1 activity by genetic manipulation could reduce substrate turnover without abolishing enzymatic activity. This study shows that SOBER1’s activity is a significant biological component in HR suppression not only in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, but also appears to act in a similar way in the agriculturally important host <italic>Brassica napus</italic>. As shown in vitro, SOBER1 might deacetylate YopJ effectors themselves, preventing a trans-acetylation reaction. Additionally, or alternatively, it might promiscuously deacetylate multiple targets that are acetylated by bacterial effector proteins. SOBER1’s enzymatic activity to counter-react effector proteins is not restricted to AvrBsT, since HR induced by HopZ1b from <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> was successfully suppressed by SOBER1 in our experiments. Additionally, we have shown that SOBER1 deacetylates the microtubule-associated protein ACIP1, which is a substrate of AvrBsT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This shows that SOBER1 directly competes with AvrBsT in a reaction-counterreaction way, and moreover, it seems likely that this competition involves more than one target, given the promiscuity of both AvrBsT and SOBER1. SOBER1’s role might involve the deacetylation of guardee proteins. If a protein guarded by an R protein became acetylated by the acetyltransferase activity of an effector protein, such as AvrBsT, SOBER1’s deacetylation activity would impair target recognition by the R protein and subsequently suppress hypersensitive response. Additional roles of the SOBER1 sub-family remain unclear. Deacetylation is not limited to pathogen infection but it appears disadvantageous to express a too active deacetylase since it suppresses immune response during a bacterial attack. This might be the reason why a weaker anchor is much more common among species than the presence of a very hydrophobic phenylalanine. Modulation of the lid-loop toward a less rigid surface and hence less deacetylation activity might lead to increased fitness against pathogenic bacteria. On the other hand, at certain time points during the evolutionary arms race between bacteria and hosts, it might be advantageous for a plant to express a strong deacetylase. In the absence of an appropriate R protein, its function might serve to counteract the harmful effects of protein acetylation as described for the activity of YopJ on mammalian MAPK kinases and NF-κB pathway kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Likewise, AvrBsT can act as virulence protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. While the presence of ACIP1 and other AvrBsT interactors foster plant defense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, SnRK1 was shown to be involved in the virulence function of AvrBsT, the decrease of AvrBs1 elicited HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Whether acetylation of SnRK1 by AvrBsT is involved in host defense suppression and whether SOBER1 activity would be able to promote HR in this context needs to be addressed by future studies. SOBER1’s reaction mechanism is distinct from known deacetylases. Human histone deacetylases (HDACs) are zinc dependent enzymes and their active site consists of a tyrosine and a charge relay of two histidines and two aspartic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, class III HDACs are NAD+ dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. These enzymes typically deacetylate lysine residues and in addition, SOBER1 features a classical catalytic triad as active site, comprising a serine, a histidine and an aspartic acid. Therefore, our study suggests that SOBER1 more likely acts as a serine/threonine deacetylase. Altogether, we believe that our results demonstrate a broad significance of SOBER1 function and deacetylation in general for plant immunity. Furthermore, our study is an example how structural data can reveal a protein’s biochemical function that would otherwise stay hidden in bare sequence information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Molecular cloning</title><p id="Par18">All genes used for bacterial overexpression were synthesized with codon optimization for <italic>E. coli</italic>.
