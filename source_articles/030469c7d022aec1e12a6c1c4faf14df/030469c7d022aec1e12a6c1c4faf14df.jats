Although both the viral vectored vaccines efficiently induce protective immunity, some concerns remain to be solved. Since HPIV-3 is a common human pathogen, the human population has pre-existing immunity to HPIV-3, which may restrict the replication of the vaccine vector. For NDV, mesogenic (intermediate virulent) strain used in previous studies is currently classified as a Select Agent in the United States, thus making it unsuitable to be used as a vaccine vector. To overcome these concerns, we have developed a modified NDV vector based on a mesogenic NDV strain, in which the ectodomains of envelope glycoproteins were replaced with the corresponding ectodomains from avian paramyxovirus serotype 3 (APMV-3). The modified NDV vector was highly attenuated in chickens and was able to express the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) gene at high level. In addition, the recombinant APMV-3 was also evaluated as a vaccine vector to express the EBOV GP gene. Guinea pigs immunized with these two vector vaccines developed high levels of neutralizing GP-specific IgG and IgA antibodies.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_42004.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe, acute and often-fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates (NHPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Currently, no licensed vaccines are available against EBOV, but several experimental vaccines are being investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Recently, vectored vaccines were found to be protective in NHPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A number of experimental viral vector vaccines based on both RNA and DNA viruses have been evaluated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, each viral vector has both advantages and disadvantages. Among RNA viruses, paramyxoviruses have several features that make them suitable for use as vaccine vectors. Firstly, the complete cytoplasmic replication of paramyxoviruses avoids integration of their genomes into the host genome. Secondly, the genomes of paramyxoviruses do not undergo recombination, which makes these vectors genetically stable. Thirdly, paramyxoviruses can replicate in a variety of cell lines and infect various species of animals, which allows development of different types of viral vectors for different species of animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) expressing EBOV glycoprotein (GP) was found to be immunogenic and protective against lethal EBOV challenge in NHPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although, this vaccine was found to be effective after two doses of vaccination in HPIV3-immune NHPs, it was found that single dose of the vaccine induced substantially less immune response in HPIV3-immunised animals compared to HPIV3-naïve animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, it still remains unclear whether this vaccine will be effective in adult human population in presence of high levels of HPIV3 antibody. Furthermore, HPIV3 is a human pathogen and its safety in immunocompromised individuals is a concern. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate additional paramyxovirus vectors for development of an effective EBOV vaccine.</p><p id="Par4">The avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) are classified in the genus <italic>Avulavirus</italic> of the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> and are officially divided into thirteen serotypes (APMV-1 through APMV-13) based on hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and comparison of genetic distance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Several additional APMV serotypes have been recently reported, which are awaiting official recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. APMV-1 includes all strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. NDV is an important pathogen of poultry. NDV strains are categorized into three pathotypes based on the severity of the disease in chickens: lentogenic (low virulent), mesogenic (moderately virulent), and velogenic (highly virulent)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Lentogenic NDV strains have been widely used as live vaccines for the poultry. NDV is a good viral vector candidate for vaccine development because NDV infects almost all avian and non-avian species, including humans, and grows to high titer in embryonated eggs as well as in Vero cells, a WHO-approved cell line for vaccine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. NDV-based EBOV vector vaccines have shown promising results in NHPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It has been reported that the mesogenic NDV strain Beaudette C (BC) replicates well in many tissue types of NHPs and elicits higher levels of immune responses compared to those induced by the lentogenic NDV strain LaSota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, all mesogenic and velogenic NDV strains are listed as Select Agents in the United States as they are pathogens of concern for the poultry, which makes them ineligible to be used as vaccine vectors. Therefore, an APMV vector used for human vaccine development should be safe for both poultry and humans in addition to being immunogenic for humans. Hence, the mesogenic NDV strain BC was modified to make it nonpathogenic for avian species. In addition, the potential of another APMV serotype for development of viral vector for humans has been evaluated.</p><p id="Par5">Among the other APMV serotypes, APMV-3 is best suited as a vaccine vector for humans because it replicates better than the other APMV serotypes in a wide range of cell types, including Vero cells and human cell lines (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) and causes negligible disease associated with loss of egg production in turkeys and chickens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. APMV-3 is not a Select Agent. APMV-3 infects NHPs without causing any clinical disease signs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This suggests that APMV-3 may be a safe vaccine vector in humans. A recombinant APMV-3 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been generated and the GFP gene was maintained for more than 10 passages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, APMV-3 represents a promising attenuated vector candidate for human vaccine development.</p><p id="Par6">In order to keep the mesogenic NDV strain BC immunogenic in primates but nonpathogenic for avian species, the ectodomains of the F and HN protein genes of NDV strain BC were replaced with the corresponding ectodomains of APMV-3 strain Netherlands. These changes did not affect the virus replication remarkably but made the BC strain avirulent to chickens. We then inserted the EBOV GP gene into the modified NDV as well as to the recombinant APMV-3 (rAPMV-3). These modified NDV and rAPMV-3 vaccine candidates were evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> in terms of their replication, GP expression and incorporation of GP into virus particles, while the induction of IgG and IgA responses and EBOV GP-specific neutralization antibodies response were evaluated in guinea pigs. Our results showed that not only the modified NDV vector but also the rAPMV-3 vector expressing GP are promising vaccine candidates for EBOV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Replacement of F and HN ectodomains of NDV by those of APMV-3 highly attenuated the virulence without affecting viral replication</title><p id="Par7">Use of mesogenic NDV strains as vaccine vectors is currently prohibited because of their potential to cause diseases in chickens. To circumvent this issue, we generated attenuated rNDV without affecting viral replication. The ectodomains of F and HN genes of mesogenic NDV strain BC were replaced with those of APMV-3 strain Netherlands (rNDV-3FHN) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The pathogenicity of the rNDV-3FHN to chickens was evaluated by mean death time (MDT) and by intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) tests (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The MDT value of the rNDV-3FHN was more than 90 h, and the ICPI value was 0.08, indicating that this rNDV vector is avirulent in chickens.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Multi-step growth kinetics of rNDV-3FHN and rAPMV-3 in embryonated chicken eggs and EBOV GP-expressing recombinants in DF-1 cells.

Our recent study has also shown that the levels of expression of the foreign GFP was highest when inserted between the P and M genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In this study, we inserted EBOV GP gene into three different intergenic regions of both the rNDV-3FHN and the rAPMV-3 genomes (N-P, P-M, and M-F) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c,d</xref>). To examine whether replication of these recombinants was affected by the GP insertion, multi-step growth kinetics of these recovered viruses were compared with that of the non-GP-expressing parental viruses in DF-1 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e,f</xref>). At the final time point of 56 h p.i., there were no remarkable differences in viral titers between all of the GP-expressing recombinants and their respective parental viruses, all reaching titers of around 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e,f</xref>). For the GP-expressing rAPMV-3, their viral growth was slightly retarded at the early time point when the GP was inserted into the N-P and the M-F regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, P &gt; 0.05), while among the GP-expressing rNDV-3FHN, no significant differences of growth kinetics were observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). These results indicated that the position of GP insertion did not largely affect virus growth.</p><p id="Par10">We then examined the expression levels of GP protein in DF-1 cells infected with the recombinant viruses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). The size of protein bands detected was approximately 130 kDa corresponding to EBOV GP. The maximum expression of GP was observed when it was inserted between the N-P genes in both backbone viruses, following the 3′-to-5′ gradient attenuation of paramyxovirus transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This is contradictory to our GFP recombinants of NDV-3FHN and APMV-3, which expressed maximum levels of GFP at the insertion location between the P-M genes (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>). Furthermore, in APMV-3 backbone viruses, the levels of GP expression were dramatically decreased at the insertion location between the P-M and between the M-F genes. In rNDV-3FHN vector, higher expression of the GP was found at insertion location between the M-F genes than between the P-M genes (P &gt; 0.05). Taken together, our results show that in the case of EBOV GP, the gene expression did not follow the gradient transcription of <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> (Lamb and Parks, 2013), which is in contrast to a position-dependent expression of GFP by NDV and APMV-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

Although rNDV-3FHN N/P-GP induced ELISA IgG titers almost similar to those of rAPMV-3 N/P-GP, its neutralizing titers were significantly higher.

However, no licensed vaccines or post-exposure treatment are currently available for EBOV infection. Although replication-competent rVSV-based EBOV vaccine candidate has shown promising results in recent trials, some side effects, such as headache, subjective fever, chill and frequent viremia have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate additional safe vector vaccines against EBOV infection.</p><p id="Par18">APMVs possesses a number of characteristics which benefit as a vaccine vector for human use because of absence of pre-exiting immunity in human population, robust replication and ability to induce mucosal immune responses. Among the APMVs, NDV (APMV-1) vector vaccine candidates have been shown to induce protective immune responses against several human pathogens including EBOV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Although both lentogenic and mesogenic NDV strains can be used as vaccine vectors in humans, vectors based on mesogenic strains replicate to higher titer in NHPs and induced better immune responses than vectors based on lentogenic strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, because of disease concern in chickens, mesogenic NDV strains are now classified as Select Agent and are prohibited for use as vaccine vectors. Therefore, in this study, we have generated an alternative NDV-based vaccine vector. This vector has the replicative machinery of a mesogenic NDV strains but the antigenicity of APMV-3. The modified NDV grew to higher titer in embryonated chicken eggs similar to APMV-3. Importantly, the modified NDV vector was apathogenic to chickens.</p><p id="Par19">The safety of NDV in humans has been documented in several studies where NDV has been used as an oncolytic agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

Hence, our results indicate that the optimal insertion site of a foreign gene to obtain high level of protein expression is not always between the P and M genes and it can vary with each foreign gene.</p><p id="Par21">It has been reported for VSV that insertion of a foreign gene between N and P genes reduced viral replication whereas insertion of a foreign gene at other gene junctions did not affect the replication level. Additionally, when a foreign gene was inserted between N and P genes, viral replication returned to parental levels within two passages and expression of the foreign gene was suppressed by mutations at the end of the upstream N gene that abolished transcriptional termination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In our study, insertion of GP gene between N and P genes for both rNDV-3FHN and rAPMV-3, viral replications were slightly retarded at early time point after the infection compared with their respective parental viruses, but they replicated with efficiency and reached similar titer as their respective parental viruses. Furthermore, unlike with VSV recombinants, 20 consecutive passages did not affect the stability of GP gene inserted between N and P genes, and a high level of GP expression was still observed. Moreover, GP was efficiently incorporated into the both rNDV-3FHN and rAPMV-3 virus particles.</p><p id="Par22">The immunogenicity of GP-expressing NDVs in NHPs has been assessed and compared to HPIV3-based vaccine viruses previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

However, the NDV vector used in that study was based on a mesogenic strain of NDV, which is now considered a Select Agent. This study showed that the modified NDV and APMV-3 vectors induced IgA, IgG and neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs, but the rNDV-3FHN vector induced higher levels of antibodies than the rAPMV-3 vector. The level of antibodies induced by rNDV-3FHN was almost equal to those induced by the avirulent NDV vector strain LaSota (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The reason for modified NDV vector to induce higher neutralizing titer than APMV-3 vector could be due to its relatively higher level of replication in guinea pigs. However, we do not consider the level of replication of our APMV vectors to be a concern in eliciting high levels of immunogenicity in humans because we have previously shown that NDV and APMV-3 replicate well in NHPs and elicit high immunogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In this study, EBOV neutralization was evaluated by a pseudotyped VSV BSL-2 neutralization test because a standard EBOV neutralization test will require BSL-4 containment. Although high degree of correlation between EBOV BSL-4 neutralization assays and pseudotyped VSV BSL-2 fluorescence reduction neutralization test has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, it should be noted that pseudotyped VSV neutralization test is not a live EBOV neutralization test; therefore, its results may or may not correlate with levels of anti-EBOV neutralizing antibodies in serum samples.</p><p id="Par23">In conclusion, our data suggest that the newly generated GP-expressing modified NDV and APMV-3 vectors can be an alternative vaccine for immunization against EBOV alone or in combination with NDV strain LaSota vector in a heterologous prime-boost strategy. Although we have previously demonstrated that like NDV, APMV-3 can replicate efficiently in NHPs, it is important to assess the immunogenicity and protection efficacy of these recombinant APMVs in NHPs. Taken together, the rNDV-3FHN and rAPMV-3 have great potential for use as vaccine vectors, which overcomes many weaknesses of the previously-reported paramyxoviral vaccine vectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cells, viruses and antibodies</title><p id="Par24">HEp-2, Vero and DF-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
