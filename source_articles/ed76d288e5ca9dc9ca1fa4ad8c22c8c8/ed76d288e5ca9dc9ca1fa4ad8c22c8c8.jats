The parasite seeds have strict requirements for germination, involving preconditioning and exposure to specific chemicals strigolactones [SLs] exuded by the host roots. SLs are plant hormones derived from plant carotenoids via a pathway involving the Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase 8 (<italic>CCD8)</italic>. Having no effective means to control parasitic weeds in most crops, and with CRISPR/Cas9 being an effective gene-editing tool, here we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of the <italic>CCD8</italic> gene can be used to develop host resistance to the parasitic weed <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic>. Cas9/single guide (sg) RNA constructs were targeted to the second exon of <italic>CCD8</italic> in tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum L</italic>.) plants. Several <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9 mutated tomato lines with variable insertions or deletions in <italic>CCD8</italic> were obtained with no identified off-targets. Genotype analysis of T1 plants showed that the introduced <italic>CCD8</italic> mutations are inherited. Compared to control tomato plants, the <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9 mutant had morphological changes that included dwarfing, excessive shoot branching and adventitious root formation. In addition, SL-deficient <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9 mutants showed a significant reduction in parasite infestation compared to non-mutated tomato plants. In the <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9 mutated lines, orobanchol (SL) content was significantly reduced but total carotenoids level and expression of genes related to carotenoid biosynthesis were increased, as compared to control plants. Taking into account, the impact of plant parasitic weeds on agriculture and difficulty to constitute efficient control methods, the current study offers insights into the development of a new, efficient method that could be combined with various collections of resistant tomato rootstocks.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>United States - Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/100006031</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">IS-4622-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aly</surname><given-names>Radi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_47893.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has emerged as a powerful genome-engineering technology with success in diverse organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Cas9-mediated genome editing technology provides enormous advantages over other classical methods in crop improvement and plant research by generating desired modifications at a specific target sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In some cases, CRISPR/Cas9 permits the direct introduction of mutations conferring resistance in crop plants, without traditional backcrosses or plant breeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

The most frequently used CRISPR/Cas9 system, type II, has three components: Cas9 endonuclease, CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans activating crRNA (tracrRNA). Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage is guided by a tracrRNA:crRNA duplex that is complementary to the target DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Recently the tracrRNA:crRNA complex is fused into a single chimeric RNA known as single guide RNA (sgRNA) containing an 18 to 20-nucleotide (nt) sequence which determines the target DNA sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) that is present at 3′-end of the target sequence was recognized by the CRISPR/Cas9 system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Use of CRISPR/Cas9 has been reported as a most effective tool for nucleotide sequence modification or editing in numerous crop species, including Arabidopsis, wheat, rice, sorghum, cotton, maize, soybean and tobacco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The genera of parasitic weeds, <italic>Orobanche</italic> and <italic>Phelipanche</italic> (Orobanchaceae), the broomrapes, consist of over 100 species and represent one of the most destructive and great challenge in agricultural production. These are obligate plant parasites that attack through the host roots of almost all economically important crops in the Solanaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae and Apiaceae plant families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The life cycle of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> is divided into two stages, preparasitic and parasitic. The preparasitic stage consists of seed preconditioning followed by germination. The germination of parasite seeds is triggered by a highly specialized detection system for strigolactones (SLs) exuded by host roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The parasitic stage initiates with the parasite developing a special intrusive organ the haustorium- that connects directly to the vascular system of the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Following successful attachment and invasion of the host root, the broomrape seedling grows into a structure known as tubercle and after 4–5 weeks of tubercle growth, a floral meristem is produced, which emerges above the ground to produce flower and seeds.</p><p id="Par4">SL is a plant hormone required for shoot branching and used as a signaling molecule for the rhizosphere microflora<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. SLs occur in all green lineages of the plant kingdom and its synthesis start with the all trans β-carotene, a carotenoid molecule which produce 9-cis-β-carotene by the activity of Dwarf 27 (<italic>D27</italic>), after that Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenases 7 (<italic>CCD7</italic>) convert it into 9 cis β–apo 10′-carotenal and finally Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenases 8 (<italic>CCD8</italic>) leads to the production of carlactone, then cytochrome P450 enzymes, More Axillary Growth 1 (<italic>MAX1</italic>) convert it into various SLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

In the rhizosphere, SL acts as a host-detection cue for symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and stimulates seed germination of parasitic plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Different types of SLs, e.g., strigol, 5-deoxystrigol, sorgolactone, solanacol, didehydroorobanchol, orobanchol and others, are known as germination stimulants for root parasites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The altered SL production conferred resistance in the host by reducing the germination of parasite seeds. Host resistance to the Orobanchaceae root parasite <italic>Striga</italic> has been observed in crops with altered SL production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, previous studies found that the tomato <italic>SL-ORT1</italic> mutagenized by fast-neutron display highly resistant to <italic>Phelipanche</italic> and <italic>Orobanche spp</italic>, the resistance results from its inability to produce and secrete SLs regarded as natural germination stimulants to the rhizosphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Different methods of parasitic weed-control (chemical, biological, cultural and resistant crops) have been applied in attempts to control broomrape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, but difficulties are encountered in targeting specific plant–plant systems. Moreover, most control strategies are less effective and have considerable limitations. Here we report the development of tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum L</italic>.) plants that are resistant to the parasitic weed <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> upon mutation of the SL-biosynthesis gene <italic>CCD8</italic> using CRISPR/Cas9.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the tomato <italic>CCD8</italic> gene</title><p id="Par5">To investigate the efficacy of using CRISPR/Cas9 to create host resistance in tomato plants against parasitic weeds, we chose to disrupt the SL-biosynthesis gene <italic>CCD8</italic> (<italic>Solyc08g066650</italic>) in tomato. SLs are synthesized from plant carotenoids via a pathway involving <italic>CCD7</italic> and <italic>CCD8</italic>. The <sup><italic><sc>CCD8</sc></italic></sup>sgRNA construct was designed using the single sgRNA cassette in the pENTR vector, which was then recombined into the pDest vector to target the second exon of <italic>CCD8</italic> (position 716–733 bp in the coding region) with a <italic>Bsr</italic>I restriction site located upstream to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). Fourteen independent T0 transgenic tomato lines were generated by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation at the Plant Transformation Facility of the University of California, Davis, USA. However, 10 out of 14 (71.4%) of the <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9 transgenic plants showed mutation at <italic>SlCCD8</italic> locus, as determined by PCR and restriction analysis (data not shown). Mutants showed similar kind of mutation at genome level considered as one single line in our study. We chose to continue our study with only those lines that showed different kind of genome editing in the T0 generation such as line 1, 2, 5 and 11 and the presence of transgene Npt-II was confirmed by PCR (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1a</xref>).To detect mutations induced by the Cas9 nuclease in T0 plants, we assessed loss of the <italic>Bsr</italic>I restriction enzyme site that might arise due to imprecise non-homologous end-joining repair. For each of the T0 plants, we PCR-amplified the <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9 target region using genomic DNA from the T0 lines (individual transformants) and then digested it with <italic>Bsr</italic>I (a site that would disrupted if Cas9-mediated genome editing had occurred in this location) and examined products on a 2% agarose gel. Digestion of the wild-type PCR fragment (452 bp) with <italic>Bsr</italic>I results in three products of 147 bp, 298 bp and 7 bp, while Cas9 editing of the target site will generally eliminate the <italic>Bsr</italic>I site that is adjacent to the PAM, leading to a 445 bp fragment. Restriction digestion of the target region-specific PCR product from lines 1, 2, 5 and 11 revealed that lines 1 and 5 were fully resistant to <italic>Bsr</italic>I digestion, whereas line 11 showed partial digestion. However, line 2 showed complete digestion of the PCR product, similar to the wild type (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Sequencing analysis of the target region PCR product from T0 lines 1, 2, 5 and 11 revealed the presence of different kinds of mutations in each line. Line 1 had a 1-nt deletion and line 2 had a 3-nt deletion; the 3-nt deletion in line 2 regenerated the <italic>Bsr</italic>I restriction site, resulting in <italic>Bsr</italic>I digestion of the PCR product in this line. In addition, these lines showed a single peak in the Sanger sequencing chromatogram, suggesting that they represent homozygous mutants for the <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9 locus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). However, lines 5 and 11 showed multiple peaks in the sequencing chromatogram, suggesting that they are either biallelic or chimeric mutants (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1b</xref>). Purified non-digested <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9 target region PCR fragments from lines 5 and 11 were cloned into a TA cloning vector. Sanger sequence analysis revealed that lines 5 and 11 are biallelic and contain four types of mutations: a 6-, 5- or 4-nt deletion, or an A insertion. Interestingly, in line 5, both alleles lost the <italic>Bsr</italic>I restriction site whereas in line 11, one of the alleles restored the <italic>Bsr</italic>I cut site after Cas9-mediated editing of the target (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic representation of the binary plant vector construct used for Cas9 and <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>sgRNA expression and <italic>CCD8</italic> locus.

T1 progeny from lines 1, 2, 5 and 11 were designated with a small letter next to the line number (1a, 1b, etc.). Genomic DNA was extracted from the T1 progeny and the target region of <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9 was amplified using PCR primers flanking the target.

Sanger sequencing of the non-<italic>Bsr</italic>I-cut fragments showed deletion mutations of various lengths upstream of the PAM sequence, similar to T0. Lines 1a and 1b each contained the same 1-nt deletion and lines 2a and 2b each had the same 3-nt deletion.

At least 15 plants from each of the T1 lines were examined for genotype at the target site using Sanger sequencing of target-site PCR products. All T1 plants from two T0 homozygous lines (T0-line 1 and T0-line 2 of <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9) were homozygous for the same mutations. In contrast, the biallelic T0 lines (T0-line 5 and T0-line 11 of <sup><italic>CCD8</italic></sup>Cas9) of the Cas9-generated mutants were segregated in the T1 generation according to classic Mendelian genetics, and the ratios between the two mutations in a biallele were close to 1:2:1 as reported previously (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The existence of the same mutations in sibling progeny suggested that the CRISPR mutation event occurred prior to meiosis in T0. Inheritance of the mutations in homozygous and biallelic T0 plants by T1 plants suggested that most, if not all, of the mutations resulting from genome editing activity are highly stable in nature and can be inherited in subsequent generations. Moreover, examination of transgenic region in some of the T1 generation plants suggest that 35% (5/14) of line 2 and 25% (4/16) of line 5, T1 plants were detected to be transgene free (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).

Another study found increased transcript level of <italic>SlD27</italic> and <italic>SlCCD8</italic> in tomato roots after <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ramosa</italic> infection, suggesting activation of the SL-biosynthesis pathway upon interaction of plant parasite with host root<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">In our previous studies, we showed that production of siRNA molecules in tomato targeting <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> genes facilitates suppression of the parasite genes and results in enhanced resistance to the parasite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, in a recent study, SL-deficient tomato lines (<italic>SlCCD8</italic>-RNAi lines) displayed increased tubercle development and enhanced infestation with pre-germinated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ramosa</italic> seeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. We assume that the contrast with our results is due to difference in mechanism of germination and susceptibility. In contrast to previous study, we do not pre germinate the parasite seeds, we directly triggered SL-deficient tomato lines with the parasite <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> seeds because <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> seeds become SL independent upon pre-germination. Another possible explanation for the increased parasitic infection in <italic>SlCCD8</italic>-RNAi lines, might be their enhanced auxin transport or altered auxin levels, as has been reported for the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SL-deficient mutant <italic>max4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to precisely knock out the <italic>CCD8</italic> gene in tomato. Disease resistance based on the editing of specific genes can be easily applied to other susceptible crops without long-term backcrossing, and even those that are distantly related. This method is expected to be effective against other <italic>Phelipanche</italic> and <italic>Orobanche</italic> species, if the parasite species share sufficient homology in their target sequences. In addition, the mutated plants are devoid of foreign DNA sequences and are not considered genetically modified organisms.</p><p id="Par21">One of the significant limitations of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is the generation of significant off-target cleavage as a result of non-specificity of the sgRNA with mismatched complementary target DNA within the genome. Thus, that may alter the function of a gene and may result in genomic instability. Although, several modifications of the Cas9 enzyme and sgRNA designing methods have been developed to increase target specificity, the off-target cleavage is still considered as major limiting factor with CRISPR/Cas9 technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Additionally, under regulatory regimes in many countries, the new breeding technology CRISPR/Cas9 does not fall under the definition of a GMO, but in the EU countries CRISPR/Cas9 is still considered as GMO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">In conclusion, using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated an effective mutation in tomato to be executed in breeding programs for resistance against parasitic weeds. In the current study, we demonstrate that genetic resistance to parasitic weeds can be created using CRISPR/Cas9. We used this technology to edit <italic>CCD8</italic> (a SL-biosynthesis gene) in tomato. We chose tomato due to its high economic importance and high susceptibility to parasitic weeds. We chose to knock out the <italic>CCD8</italic> gene due to its role in SL production and its clear morphological phenotype (increased shoot branching, adventitious root formation and dwarfing). We realize that mutations in <italic>CCD8</italic> can negatively affect tomato plant morphology; however, to avoid this issue, our system could be used in a rootstock grafted to a wild-type scion, and might be combined with tomato rootstocks that are already resistant to fungal pathogens, viruses, and nematodes. Further study is needed with grafting experiments to investigate this concept, which might be applicable to a wide range of crop plants. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the generation of tomato plants that are resistant to the weedy parasite <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Materials and growth conditions</title><p id="Par23">Tomato seeds (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum L</italic>.)
