This virus is the pathogen that causes the viral nervous necrosis (VNN) in many species of fish. It can lead to large-scale death of the larvae and juveniles and the cumulative mortality can be as high as 100 % within 1 week after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This virus is widely distributed. There have been reports about its epidemic in Asia, Australia, North America, and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. NNVs are divided into four genotypes, including barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus (BFNNV), red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV) and tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus (TPNNV). Among them, RGNNV is the most popular one. Currently, there have been no methods available for effective treatment of VNN caused by these types of virus. Thus, it is of extreme importance to establish a rapid and highly sensitive method for detection of these pathogens for prevention and control of this disease.</p><p id="Par6">Currently, there have been several methods available for detection of NNV, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and molecular biology-based methodologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Among them, the molecular biology-based methodologies are more rapid and accurate and thus, the most widely used methods applied in the detection of NNV in fish samples. The molecular biology-based methodologies include the conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] etc. While these methodologies have been used in detection of NNV, each of them has certain limitations and shortcomings. For instance, the sensitivity for conventional RT-PCR is not high enough as its lowest limit of detection (LLOD) is as high as 10<sup>2</sup> copies and thus, it does not meet the requirement for prevention and control of NNV. Although qRT-PCR is highly sensitive, this method requires the expensive equipment and reagents and can’t be used on the spot. While LAMP is relatively sensitive and can be used on the spot, its specificity was relatively low due to the use of staining dyes for color development of the amplified products. Cross-priming isothermal amplification (CPA) is a currently developed, nucleic acid-based amplification method which is rapid and highly effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. With this method, at least one cross primer is used, making the sequences of the amplified product to form semi-loop single-stranded structure or branched structures. Under the action of <italic>Bst</italic> DNA polymerase which possesses the strand displacement activity, the targeted DNA sequence is continually amplified at a constant temperature. This technology has been successfully applied in the detection of many types of bacteria and virus, including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], <italic>Enterobacter sakazakii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], <italic>Acidovorax citrulli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], fowl adenovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and white spot syndrome virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] etc. In term of the analysis of nucleic acid-based amplified products, lateral flow dipstick (LFD) detection technology has been widely applied because it has a characteristic of rapid reaction and can be easily carried [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The principle of LFD is as follow: the amplified nucleic acid product doubly labeled with FITC and Biotin is drop-wise added on the dipstick, which interacts with the anti-biotin antibody- carrying colloidal gold and this complex is migrated with the liquid flow along the dipstick to the detection line where it is captured by anti-FITC antibody and aggregated, finally forming a red and macroscopical strip on the detection line. CPA coupled with LFD (CPA-LFD) may allow achieving the rapid and effective detection of pathogens on the spot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we established a cross-priming-isothermal amplification coupled with lateral flow dipstick method for specific detection of RGNNV and applied this method in detection of RGNNV in fish samples. The establishment of this method has provided a convenient way for rapid detection of RGNNV on the spot for those laboratories that have only simple equipment or aquaculture farms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fish Samples and RNA isolation</title><p id="Par8">Moribund half-smooth tongue sole (<italic>Cynoglossus semilaevis</italic>) juveniles of 35 days post-hatching were collected from Shandong province, China, in 2012.

This virus mainly infects larvae and juveniles and causes harmful damage to them. The cumulative mortality of infected fish can be as high as 100 %. Its infection causes relatively large economic loss for aquaculture industry. Thus, it is essential to have the availability of an effective method for rapid and accurate detection of RGNNV to prevent and control the fish diseases caused.</p><p id="Par22">Compared to PCR-based detection technologies, CPA and LAMP do not need the thermal denature and the changes in temperature and thus, do not need the complicated and precise equipment and the time for detection is short. However, LAMP required an initial denaturation step but CPA does not. Thus, CPA is simpler, quicker, cheaper and more stable than LAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The use of LFD to analyze the CPA-amplified results only took 10 min to observe the results while agarose gel electrophoresis usually took about 40 min. LFD does not need to use the nucleic acid-staining dyes such as GeneFinder and ethidium bromide which can cause harmful effects on human. Owning to these advantages mentioned above, LFD has been widely applied in the detection of various pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Its sensitivity is comparable to or slightly higher than that of agarose gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The CPA-LFD method has been applied in the <italic>in vitro</italic> detection and diagnosis of human pathogens including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], <italic>Enterobacter sakazakii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] etc. However, there have been few reports about its application in the detection of pathogens that cause fish diseases. In this study, we established a combination of CPA with lateral flow dipstick (LFD) and applied it to detect RGNNV in fish samples.</p><p id="Par23">In this study, by comparing the sensitivities of CPA-LFD, conventional RT-PCR and qRT-PCR, we found that the LLODs for CPA-LFD was 10<sup>1</sup> copies/μL, which is 10 times higher than that of the conventional RT-PCR and is comparable to that of qRT-PCR. CPA-LFD was a detection method with high sensitivity when it was applied in the transgenic detection, its sensitivity was also 10<sup>1</sup> copies/μL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The specificity of the CPA-LFD assay was also performed, which revealed the CPA-LFD assay was specific to RGNNV without any cross-reaction with other tested viruses and bacteria. The BLAST result showed that the sequence similarity between our primers and SJNNV was very high (92 %) and it means the CPA-LFD can detect SJNNV potentially. In contrast, the CPA-LFD assay has no cross-reaction with other two NNV genotypes (BFNNV and TPNNV) because the sequence similarities were 0 %. Similar results in LAMP were also reported by Rungkarn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">With the CPA-LFD method established in this study, the amplification reaction took place at a constant temperature of 69 °C and the results were visualized by naked eyes via a simple LFD. The entire reaction process only required pieces of simple equipment for maintaining the constant temperature but did not need the large and complex instrument. With CPA-LFD method, the amplification time by CPA was 1 h and the entire procedures from preparation of samples to acquirement of detection results needed only about 1.5 h while the conventional RT-PCR required 2–3 h and nested RT-PCR required longer time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has been indicated that CPA isothermal reaction for 45 min, the amplified product could be obviously visualized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this study, we did not test whether the amplification time could be further shortened.</p><p id="Par26">A previous study established a LAMP method and found that its sensitivity for RGNNV could reach 10<sup>1</sup> copies/μL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The results detected with CPA-LFD method were basically in line with those detected with LAMP kit. However, LAMP needs to use dyes for development color and it is hard to clearly distinguish the weakly positive results from the negative results with naked eyes and erroneous judgment can be easily made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. With LFD, the weakly positive results and the negative results can be more obviously visualized and compared and the erroneous judgment can be reduced to certain extend.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par27">In summary, in this study, we established a CPA-LFD method specific for the detection of RGNNV. This convenient method possesses the characteristics of shorter detection time, high sensitivity and strong specificity and thus can have an application potential not only suitable for the use in laboratories but is more suitable for the aquaculture farms for rapid detection of this virus on the pot.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is supported by
