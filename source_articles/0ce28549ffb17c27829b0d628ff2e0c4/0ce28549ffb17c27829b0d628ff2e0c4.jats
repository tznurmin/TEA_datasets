Results of transcriptome sequencing at 0, 48, 96 and 144 hpi showed that 8810 genes were disease-responsive genes after challenge by <italic>S. botryosum</italic>. Among them, 7526 genes displayed a similar expression trend in both RILs, and some of them were likely involved in non-host resistance. The remaining 1284 genes were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between RILs. Of those, 712 DEGs upregulated in LR-66-637 were mostly enriched in ‘carbohydrate metabolic process’, ‘cell wall organization or biogenesis’, and ‘polysaccharide metabolic process’. In contrast, there were another 572 DEGs that were upregulated in LR-66-577, and some of them were enriched in ‘oxidation-reduction process’, ‘asparagine metabolic process’ and ‘asparagine biosynthetic process’. After comparing DEGs to genes identified in previously described quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to SB, nine genes were common and three of them showed differential gene expression between a resistant and a susceptible bulk consisting of five RILs each. Results showed that two genes encoding calcium-transporting ATPase and glutamate receptor3.2 were candidate resistance genes, whereas one gene with unknown function was a candidate susceptibility gene.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of resistance and susceptibility in <italic>L. ervoides</italic> RILs responding to <italic>S. botryosum</italic> infection.

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par18">The cultivated lentil (<italic>Lens culinaris</italic> Medikus ssp. <italic>culinaris</italic>) is one of the most agronomically important grain legumes with a global production of 6.3 million tons in 2016 which was primarily contributed by Canada (50.8%), India (16.8%), Turkey (5.8%) and the USA (4.0%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Abiotic and biotic stresses are reducing the yield potential of lentil, so breeding efforts have focused on the development of varieties with resistance to these stresses. The main breeding strategy has been relying on selection of superior individuals derived from crosses between elite breeding lines or cultivars. Due to the intensive selection driven by certain traits of interests and hybridization of closely related breeding lines, the genetic variability of lentil germplasm inevitably has been narrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Associated with limited genetic variability in crops is a heightened risk for crop vulnerability to biotic and abiotic stresses, a major concern shared among plant breeders and growers alike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Stemphylium blight (SB), caused by the necrotrophic ascomycete <italic>Stemphylium botryosum</italic> Wallr., is a devastating disease of lentil in several lentil-producing countries, including Canada, India, the USA, and Australia which together account for over 70% of global production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This pathogen infects plants by airborne conidia that develop successive cycles of conidia on plants. In the early stage of SB, disease symptoms manifest as tan to light brown spots on lentil leaves. As the infection progresses, those initial spots expand to the entire leaves, resulting in the complete drying of leaves followed by defoliation. In the final stages, SB symptoms are also found on stems and hamper nutrient and water transport, which eventually kills the host. The economic losses caused by this pathogen can be up to 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A few SB resistant commercial cultivars have been developed in some of the lentil-producing regions, especially in Bangladesh (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]).</p><p id="Par19">Studies in a range of crop species have shown that many alleles representing broad genetic diversity and phenotypic variation reside in wild germplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Exploring novel disease resistance alleles from exotic libraries has been a useful strategy for genetic improvement in many crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In lentil, Podder et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] evaluated resistance to SB among 70 lentil accessions representing seven species in the genus <italic>Lens</italic> and found that <italic>L. ervoides</italic> (Brign.) Grande exhibited superior SB resistance in a much higher frequency than other species. Facilitated by the sophisticated ovule rescue technique that overcomes the interspecific reproductive barriers between <italic>L. ervoides</italic> and <italic>L. culinaris</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], interest in introgressing useful genes from <italic>L. ervoides</italic> to elite cultivars has been increasing strongly, in particular because resistance to other diseases such as ascochyta blight (caused by <italic>Ascochyta lentis</italic> Vassiljevsky) and anthracnose (caused by <italic>Colletotrichum lentis</italic> Damm) has also been identified in this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">To date, detailed knowledge of the molecular bases underlying SB resistance in <italic>L. ervoides</italic> is still lacking and the only available information is the presence of three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with SB on a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -based linkage map of an F<sub>9</sub> recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of <italic>L. ervoides</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite the identification and localization of these QTLs, their direct use in marker-assisted selection is limited and identification of candidate resistance genes is difficult because those QTL intervals (2-LOD) are relatively large (6 to 21 MB) and contain hundreds of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">A functional understanding of SB resistance has been largely developed in model plants such as tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) Heynh. In tomato, Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] mapped a single dominant locus in a 260 Kb chromosomal region conferring resistance to SB (caused by <italic>S. lycopersici</italic> (Enjoji) W. Yamam.) and identified two putative resistance genes coding for a cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase (CRK) and a receptor-like kinase (RLK). This indicated that resistance in tomato was likely mediated via the recognition between plant and pathogen. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, Di et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] reported that a gene encoding polygalactoronase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) was upregulated during the <italic>S. solani</italic> infection period. As PGIP belongs to a large family of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins, it was suspected that a hypersensitive response (HR) may affect SB resistance in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, due to the highly complex nature of resistances to necrotrophic pathogens, it is still unknown if these mechanisms can be extended to other plant species. Therefore, a comprehensive molecular study of SB resistance in <italic>L. ervoides</italic> would not only benefit lentil breeding but also broaden our knowledge of SB resistance in systems other than model plant systems.</p><p id="Par22">In recent years, the study of RNA has been significantly improved by the advancement in high-throughput next-generation sequencing techniques that generate massive amounts of data suitable for in-depth quantification of genome-wide gene expression across treatments, time points and genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In lentil, several RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies were performed to profile transcriptomes, develop molecular markers or investigate plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Most of these studies were conducted by de novo assembly without the aid of a reference genome. The common issues with de novo assembly have been alignment errors, problems in reconstruction of full-length transcripts, and chimerism errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As the <italic>L. culinaris</italic> genome was recently constructed by Bett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], reference-based transcriptome assembly is possible and encouraged to improve downstream analyses.</p><p id="Par23">As RNA transcription is a highly dynamic process, the appropriate sampling time is of high importance to capture genes of interest, and to achieve this, the quantitative assessments of fungal development implemented by microscopic observation and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) are promising options. Several studies proved that these two methods well integrate both visual and digital assessments of fungal biomass and development in a range of hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, we recruited those methods and RILs from the F<sub>9</sub><italic>L. ervoides</italic> RIL population LR-66 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] to study SB resistance in <italic>L. ervoides</italic>. Firstly, we performed microscopic and qPCR studies to quantify the development of <italic>S. botryosum</italic> in plants during the first 10 days post-inoculation. Secondly, we conducted a time-series RNA-Seq experiment on two SB infected RILs that displayed contrasting SB susceptibilities. Gene expression data were submitted to differentially expressed gene analyses (DEG) to understand the regulatory pathways that were involved in SB defense responses. To further screen the candidate genes governing resistance and susceptibility to SB, we then performed bulk segregation gene expression analysis using pooled susceptible and resistant RILs from the LR-66 population to verify the expression of those DEGs that were located in identified QTLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The objectives of this study were to extend our understanding of SB resistance and identify putative resistant genes to facilitate use of <italic>L. ervoides</italic> in commercial lentil breeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quantification of fungal development</title><p id="Par24">Our inoculation experiment with <italic>S. botryosum</italic> isolate SB19 resulted in distinctly more disease in <italic>L. ervoides</italic> RIL LR-66-577 than LR-66-637 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The percentage of conidial germination and penetration, and germ tube lengths were recorded for the first 48 h post-inoculation (hpi) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Results showed that the germination of conidia increased over time and reached its highest level (94.4% for LR-66-637, 98.5% for LR-66-577) at 48 hpi. Approximate 50% of conidia had germinated with germ tubes that had successfully penetrated into the plant epidermal cells at 6 hpi (both RILs), which increased to 69.6% (LR-66-637) or 67.2% (LR-66-577) at 12 hpi. Germ tube length on the leaf surface was quantified from 12 to 24 hpi and revealed a substantial increase from approximate 200 μm (both RILs) at 12 hpi to 395 μm (LR-66-637) or 486 μm (LR-66-577) at 24 hpi. However, there was no statistical difference between the resistant RIL LR-66-637 and the susceptible RIL LR-66-577 for these fungal growth parameters. At 48 hpi, we started to observe a few chlorotic spots on leaflets. As the infected plants displayed evidence of leaf necrosis at 72 hpi, we decided to record the percentage of necrotic leaf tissue from 72 to 144 hpi at 24-h-intervals. Results showed that necrosis increased with incubation time in both RILs, and the susceptible RIL LR-66-577 had a significantly higher percentage of necrotic leaf tissue than the resistant RIL LR-66-637 throughout this period.

Results showed that fungal growth was slow before 48 hpi but accelerated after 48 hpi. No statistical differences were seen between RILs before 48 hpi, which agrees with our histopathological observations, but significantly more fungal biomass developed in the susceptible LR-66-577 up to the end of observations at 240 hpi. Interestingly, the relative fungal biomass decreased after 144 hpi in both resistant and susceptible RILs, indicating that expansion and growth of lentil plants outpaced fungal growth as a secondary cycle of infection through a new-generation of air-borne conidia of SB19 was largely immobilized due to lack of air currents inside the bags that enclosed single pots to maintain high air humidity. Based on these observations, we decided to collect samples at 48, 96, and 144 hpi for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Analyses of variability among RILs samples at different time points</title><p id="Par26">To assess the variability of gene expression of RIL samples at different time points, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the data dimensionality for ease of visualization. This revealed that the three replicates of samples clustered closely together after excluding one replicate of LR-66-637 at 0 hpi which deviated from other replicates. This sample was considered as an outlier and was therefore discarded from the subsequent analyses. After removing this outlier, the PCA plot clearly separated samples of the same RIL at 0 and 48 hpi, but not at 96 and 144 hpi which were located together (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a).

In the present study, the difference in SB19 development between the resistant RIL LR-66-637 and the susceptible RIL LR-66-577 was negligible before 24 hpi, indicating that the resistance toward SB19 in RIL LR-66-637 was probably based on post-penetration inhibition of the fungus. Similar observations were also reported for <italic>S. botryosum</italic> infecting alfalfa where Cowling and Gilchrist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] found that the development of <italic>S. botryosum</italic> did not differ among the resistant, moderately resistant and susceptible alfalfa clones during the early period of infection. During the period from 48 to 144 hpi, fungal biomass started to accumulate in RILs, suggesting that <italic>S. botryosum</italic> initiated the release of phytotoxins to disrupt host cells around 48 hpi. Biomass accumulation was significantly higher in LR-66-577 than in LR-66-637, possibly as a result of enhanced tolerance to phytotoxins in LR-66-637 compared to LR-66-577 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

PCA also separated LR-66-637 from LR-66-577 samples, indicating that the transcriptome responses of LR-66-637 and LR-66-577 were different after challenge with SB19. As this separation was more evident at 96 or 144 hpi than at 48 hpi, a significant interaction effect of hpi × RIL was expected. These results confirmed that the transcriptomes of RILs responded to SB19 infection in a time-dependent manner as has been observed in other transcriptome studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Non-host resistance is a non-specific and broad-spectrum defense mechanism that is universally present in plants as a defense against microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. By analyzing those disease-responsive genes of both RILs, we observed that a large number of genes downregulated in both RILs were enriched in a series of development-related and energy synthesis-related GO terms. These results seemed to indicate that SB19 infection disrupted the normal growth and energy synthesis of both RILs regardless of their varying levels of resistance to the pathogen.

Other gene expression data on the lentil - <italic>S. botryosum</italic> system have not been reported to date, but stronger upregulation of a series of metabolic processes (organic substance metabolic, single-organism metabolic, or cellular glucan metabolic) based on RNA-Seq experiments were reported in the resistant lentil genotypes CDC-Robin, 964a-46, or ILL7537 after inoculation of <italic>Ascochyta lentis,</italic> another lentil pathogen presumed to be a necrotroph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

This suggests that redox homeostasis was substantially altered in LR-66-577 after SB19 invasion, which was reported for other systems previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. A change in redox status in the challenged cells could release a variety of reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen, superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, accumulation of which could trigger the plant’s hypersensitive response and programmed cell death (PCD) to cause leaf necrosis and, eventually, leaf dehiscence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

BSA was used here and revealed a calcium-transporting ATPase (Lc05858) and a receptor3.2 (Lc12983) with a high expression in the resistant pool indicating that they could be putative resistance genes. A calcium transporting ATPase, such as Lc05858, could play an important role in calcium influx and efflux regulation to maintain an appropriate cellular calcium homeostasis, the change of which is thought to initiate calcium signaling that triggers a series of downstream responses influencing plant growth, development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

Evident transgressive segregation and disease severity in RILs ranging from 11 to 80% in this population indicated that there was fluent genetic variability in SB resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Prior to planting, seeds of RILs were scarified to facilitate germination. The scarified seeds were sowed in 10-cm plastic pots filled with Fafard® Germination Mix (Sungro Horticulture® Ltd., Vancouver, BC, Canada). All plants were grown in a growth chamber with a constant temperature of 23 °C and a day length of 16 h light/8 h dark. Only four plants per pot were kept for the subsequent inoculation experiment. The inoculum was prepared from the aggressive <italic>S. botryosum</italic> isolate SB19 which originated from the southeast of Saskatchewan, Canada. The cryopreserved SB19 spores were revitalized on oatmeal V8 agar medium [150 mL V8 juice (Campbell Co., Canada), 10 g Difco™ Potato Dextrose Agar (Becton Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lake, NJ, USA), 3 g calcium carbonate, 850 mL sterile water]. After seven days of incubation at room temperature, conidia were collected from Petri dishes by flooding and scraping the surface of the plates. The conidial suspension was filtered through two layers of miracloth and adjusted to 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> condia mL<sup>− 1</sup> using a hemocytometer. Two droplets of Tween 20 (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) were added to every 1000 mL of suspension before inoculation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Pathogen inoculation and experimental design</title><p id="Par46">Four-week old plants were sprayed with the conidial suspension until run off, which was equivalent to approximate 2 to 2.5 mL per plant. Four plants within a pot represented one of three biological replicates and were pooled to generate a biological replicate. Pots were arranged in a completely randomized design in a misting chamber at 100% humidity for the first 48 h to favor germination of conidia. After 48 hpi, those inoculated plants were removed from the misting chamber, each pot was enclosed in a translucent plastic bag, and pots were maintained at 23 °C and 16 h photoperiod. Leaves were sampled at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 196, and 240 hpi, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored in a -80 °C freezer for future uses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Determination of fungal development</title><p id="Par47">Microscopy-based methods and qPCR were used to quantify growth of SB19 in plants. For qPCR, the genes targeting RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPL-4) to amplify gDNA of SB19 and elongation factor (LcEF1α) to quantify <italic>L. ervoides</italic> were used (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM8">8</xref>: Table S7). The SDS method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] was used to extract gDNA from both organisms and a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop™ 8000, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) was employed to quantify the DNA concentration, which was adjusted to 25 ng μl<sup>− 1</sup> for all samples. Each qPCR reaction contained 2 μl DNA template, 5 μl SYBR® Green (catalog no. 4309155, Thermo Scientific), 0.2 μl each of 10 μM forward and reverse primers, and 2.6 μl molecular grade water.

The collected leaflets were cleared in CMAA fixation solution (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% acetic acid) for at least 24 h at room temperature to eliminate chlorophyll in cells. Once treated, they were immersed in a series of decreasing ethanol concentrations of 70% for 1 h, 50% for 1.5 h and 30% for 1.5 h. Staining was performed by immersing leaflets in 0.05% trypan blue overnight. Well stained leaflets were mounted on glass slides in a droplet of 50% glycerol and evaluated under a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). High-quality photos were generated using a Pixelink A686C camera (Pixelink, Rochester, NY, USA) and Zeiss Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To quantify fungal development during the incubation process, we record percentage of conidial germination, percentage of conidia resulting in successful penetration (% conidial penetration), and germ tube length. Furthermore, the percentage area of dead tissue per leaflet was visually estimated (% leaf necrosis). Data were analyzed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Normality of errors was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test and homogeneity of variance with the Levene’s tests.
