By adding BP recombination sites to the sequence of primers used for the synthesis of full-length cDNAs, we were able to transfer the full-length cDNAs of the library to an expression binary vector with CaMV 35S promoter, which allowed a subsequent screening for candidate genes potentially involved in the disease process by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient assay. Results showed that the newly established approach preferentially suppressed the cDNA abundance of most constitutive genes and enriched or normalized that of the upregulated ones. Subsequent screening with transient expression <italic>in planta</italic> isolated 61 clones, which carry full-length cDNAs of 32 distinct genes, were capable of causing cell death on <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. When transiently expressed in barley leaf, five of the identified genes were able to induce chlorosis, and additional 11 genes were found to promote disease symptoms caused by infection with the blast pathogen while the others did not enhance the symptoms of pathogen infection. These observations demonstrate that the subtractive hybridization-assisted functional screening is an efficient approach that provides initial leads to the role of candidate genes in the complex

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">Transcriptional reprogramming has a key role in modulating plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Multiple high throughput technologies, including expressed sequence tags analysis (EST), microarray, and transcriptome sequencing, have been used to document the global changes in gene expression during plant-pathogen interactions (Jantasuriyarat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>; Mosquera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>; Polesani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2013</xref>; Dong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>). As a result, these techniques produce a large amount of data regarding changes in transcription profiles in response to pathogen infection. However, causative roles of most of these changes in gene expression for disease resistance or susceptibility can hardly be established simply by transcription profiling assays. For instance, it has been shown that transcription factors massively induced in a disease process may enhance resistance against the same pathogen when overexpressed <italic>in planta</italic> (Chujo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>; Jimmy and Babu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>). Likewise, numerous defense-related genes can be upregulated during compatible host-pathogen interactions (Fung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>; Bagnaresi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>). Nevertheless, increasing evidence has shown that plant susceptibility is actively manipulated by pathogens during the infection process. The rice bacterial blight pathogen, <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic>, is able to secrete transcription activator-like effectors into plant cells to upregulate the transcription of a range of sugar transporter genes and promote the gain of nutrition essential for the successful establishment of pathogen infection (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>); the overexpression of some pathogenesis-related genes, such as <italic>HSC70</italic> and <italic>OsWRKY28</italic>, has been shown to enhance the development of plant disease-related symptoms (NoÃ«l et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>; Chujo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>). At present, our knowledge on the plant susceptibility genes conditioning the compatible disease process is still limited, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant disease susceptibility still remain elusive. Adding to the complexity of the disease-associated transcriptional reprogramming, not all the upregulated genes are directly involved in the disease process: pathogen infections often trigger robust biological crosstalks that lead to transcriptional activation of genes conditioning other biological processes including plant growth and response to abiotic stresses (Berri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>; Polesani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>). Thus, it is of great significance to produce functional information about the commonly hundreds or thousands of genes differentially expressed in the plant-microbe interactions, and to determine the key players mediating diverse disease outcomes.</p><p id="Par14">Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) is a PCR-based approach to highlight differentially expressed genes between two populations of transcripts (Diatchenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1996</xref>), and it has been widely used in the study of transcriptional regulation of various biological processes including human disease (Miyasaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2001</xref>) and plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (Xiong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2001</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2002</xref>; Thara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2003</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>; Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>). However, the conventional SSH protocol generates short ESTs rather than full-length cDNAs in nearly all cases (Diatchenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1996</xref>; Diatchenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>). To enrich full-length cDNAs of differentially expressed genes, the duplex-specific nuclease (DSN), which only cleaves double-strand DNAs, has been used in the subtractive hybridization system to eliminate most of the hybridized sequences. This DSN-mediated transcriptome subtraction (DTS) has been shown successful in isolation of full-length cDNAs of differentially expressed genes, but it still relies on homology searches to predict the gene function (Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2008</xref>; Dai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>; Xue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2012</xref>). Therefore, a convenient system still awaits to be established to accommodate the phenotype-based screening of copious full-length cDNAs derived from differentially expressed genes during plant-microbe interactions.</p><p id="Par15">In this study, we modified the DTS method to improve the efficiency of subtractive hybridization and integrated the SMART cloning technology and GatewayÂ® cloning technology into the newly developed DSN-mediated subtractive hybridization (hereafter DSH). Using the DSH, we were able to construct on a binary expression vector the normalized library consisting of full-length cDNAs of genes upregulated during the early stage of rice blast disease. We subsequently performed an initial functional screening for the library clones capable of inducing cell death by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient assays on <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. Out of 6720 individual clones screened, 61 clones were able to induce cell death, among which 32 genes were identified to encode pathogenesis-related proteins (PR) and a range of hypothetical proteins with unknown functions. Transient expression of these 32 candidate genes in barley leaves further revealed that five of them were able to induce leaf chlorosis per se, and that additional 11 genes promoted disease upon infection with the blast fungus. These data illustrate that the DSH is a robust approach for isolation and functional screening of disease-induced full-length cDNAs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sampling of plant materials for DSH</title><p id="Par16">To isolate genes upregulated in the biotrophic stage of infection, detached leaves from rice seedlings (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> cv LTH) were inoculated with spore suspensions prepared from a compatible strain (P131) of blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. At 36âh post inoculation (hpi), the water-soaking symptom started to appear on inoculation sites (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1a); the symptom intensified at 48 hpi, and fungal hyphae were visible with microscopic observation of tissues stained with trypan blue (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1a, b); typical sharp-edged lesions developed at 72âhpi along with the formation of conidiophores on the infected tissues (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1a, b). We thus collected inoculated tissues at 8, 18, 24, and 36 hpi as samples from the biotrophic stage (Kankanala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>; Mosquera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>; Khang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>) to prepare the tester cDNAs, and samples from 2 hpi were used to prepare the driver cDNAs for the DSH experiment (Diatchenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The principle of DSH</title><p id="Par17">A schematic representation of the DSH method is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a.

Similarly, the first-strand driver cDNAs were reverse transcribed with primers 5âCPEx-TSO/3âAPEx-polyT<sub>30</sub>, and resultant cDNAs were enriched with PCR amplification with the primer pair of 5âCPEx/3âAPEx.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic drawings of DSH and construction of the cDNA library of upregulated transcripts. <bold>a</bold> Different primers were used for the synthesis of first-strand tester and driver cDNAs.

Based on the second order kinetics of hybridization (Britten and Davidson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1985</xref>; Diatchenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1996</xref>), high-abundance cDNAs anneal faster than low-abundance ones, and hence, most of the cDNAs of house-keeping genes in tester anneal faster with excessive driver cDNAs to form double-strand (ds) molecules. By contrast, most of the cDNAs of upregulated genes and some low-abundance constitutive cDNAs may remain as single-strand (ss) DNAs after hybridization. The ds cDNAs formed by renaturation are subsequently cleaved by DSN, but the ss cDNAs will be reserved. As a result, the highly abundant cDNAs are subtracted and cDNAs at various abundance levels in tester are normalized at the same time. The remainder of tester ss cDNAs is selectively amplified by PCR using primers of tester-enrichF/tester-enrichR, which may lead to a relative enrichment of upregulated cDNAs compared with constitutive ones (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The effect of DSH on subtractive hybridization and normalization of cDNAs</title><p id="Par19">Our initial attempts of DSH using the DTS hybridization parameters rendered strong variation in subtractive hybridization among diverse cDNA molecules. According to the protocol of DTS hybridization, tester and driver cDNAs are mixed with hybridization buffer and denatured at 98âÂ°C for 2âmin to produce ss cDNA molecules (Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2008</xref>). To test whether this was the optimal condition for thorough melting of cDNAs, we selected two constitutive genes of rice plant (<italic>OsActin</italic> and <italic>OsCAT-A</italic>) to investigate the extent of denaturation of the tester and driver cDNAs. Following denaturation, samples were treated with DSN to remove undenatured ds cDNAs, and levels of residual ss cDNAs were assayed with semiquantitative PCR. Results showed that in comparison with the non-DSN treated samples, cDNAs of <italic>OsCAT-A</italic>, but not <italic>OsActin</italic>, were dramatically lost in DSN treated samples (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), indicating that <italic>OsCAT-A</italic> cDNAs were poorly denatured. To circumvent this problem, cDNA samples were denatured without addition of the hybridization buffer, and results showed that DSN treatment had little impact on ss cDNA levels of both <italic>OsActin</italic> and <italic>OsCAT-A</italic> genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), suggesting that heat denaturation prior to the addition of hybridization buffer is crucial to improve the effect of DSH on cDNA subtraction and normalization.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Hybridization buffer prevented complete denaturation of cDNAs.

the library or the screening is nearly saturated. Collectively, these 61 clones encode 32 proteins with diverse annotated functions (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), among which one hypothetical protein and a polysaccharide deacetylase are from the pathogen, and the rest are all from rice plant.

To determine whether these genes are also involved in the plant-microbe interaction, the isolated Agrobacterial clones were used to transiently express these genes in barley leaves (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> cv.

As the PCR-based SSH technique is inefficient for isolation of the full-length cDNAs, we adopted the idea of DTS and made significant changes to improve the efficiency of the DSH and subsequent library construction: (i) Tester and driver are denatured in 10âmM Tris-HCl buffer (pHâ8.0) instead of the hybridization buffer to promote complete melting of cDNAs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and protect from damage of DNA by heat treatment as well (Bruskov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2002</xref>); (ii) Highly efficient phage cloning was used to construct the library and thereby minimized the undesirable selection for shorter fragments during PCR amplification and plasmid cloning of the full-length cDNAs; (iii) GatewayÂ® cloning technology was incorporated to allow cDNA library being transferred conveniently into diverse expression systems.</p><p id="Par26">The efficiency of the DSH method was corroborated by surveying a panel of constitutive and upregulated genes from rice and the blast fungus, and we observed, as expected, the obvious suppression of cDNA abundance of six constitutive genes, and a relative enrichment or normalization of six genes upregulated in the rice-blast fungus interaction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Moreover, the patterns of cDNA amplification by semiquantitative PCR were similar between DSH product and the plasmids of the expression library (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), suggesting that the final expression library has a good representation of diverse cDNA species in the DSH product. Nevertheless, not all of the tested reference genes behaved as expected. For instance, the signal of weakly upregulated rice gene <italic>OsPGIP1</italic> was lost after DSH treatment (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Figure S2 and AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Figure S4), which could be due to that high GC content (70%) of the cDNA led to insufficient denaturation or over hybridization of the molecule. We also found two constitutive cDNAs from the fungus, such as <italic>MGG_01160</italic> and <italic>MGG_04467</italic>, were recalcitrant to subtraction (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Figure S2 and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Figure S4).</p><p id="Par27">The transition of lifestyle of a hemibiotrophic phytopathogen, such as the blast fungus, from biotroph to necrotroph is presumably associated with necrosis and lesion formation on infected tissues (Kankanala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>; Horbach and Deising <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>; Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>), but the exact mechanisms underlying the pathogen phase change and plant cell death are poorly understood. Meanwhile, the loss-of-function genetic screening has only uncovered in the plant a limited number of key genes required for disease susceptibility, probably due to the existence of redundancy among signaling or metabolic pathways leading to the disease outcome. <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient expression <italic>in planta</italic> has been widely used as a part of the functional analysis of key genes involved in diverse biological processes. By transient gain-of-function screening of the expression library, we have identified 32 unique candidate genes that are able to trigger cell death when overexpressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants, implying that the phase change associated plant cell death may be a highly-regulated process. Consistent with this, many of the genes identified by the screening, including those encoding MYB-related proteins (Xiong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2001</xref>), Zinc finger proteins (Xiong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2001</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>) and WRKYs (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>; Chujo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>), have been reported to be upregulated during pathogen infection of the rice plants. For instance, OsWRKY72 is a senescence-associated transcription factor and may mediate the ROS-induced cell death in rice plant (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>). Moreover, multiple candidate proteins or their closely related orthologs have been shown implicated in diverse plant-microbe interactions. Rice chitinase 11 is a PR protein strongly induced by pathogen infection, and overexpression of the protein in transgenic rice plants enhances the resistance against sheath blight disease (Grover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>); whereas the PPIases, which mediate protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, are targeted by pathogens to subdue plant defenses (Kromina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>; Fan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>). In contrast, OsWRKY28 has been identified as a negative regulator of immunity and can enhance susceptibility to blast disease when overexpressed in transgenic plants (Chujo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>); likewise, overexpression of the Arabidopsis heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), sharing over 90% of sequence identity with the candidate rice heat shock cognate protein 2 found in this study, disables resistance to virulent pathogen strains including <italic>Hyaloperonospora parasitica</italic> Noco2 and <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000 (NoÃ«l et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">Interestingly, except for the leaf chlorosis caused by the expression of the five candidate proteins such as Myb-related protein 308 and Zinc finger protein 8, we did not observe prominent cell death akin to that on <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> following the transient expression of these genes in barley. This may be due to the low efficiency of the transient expression system on the barley plant. Nevertheless, the expression of half of the identified genes in barley indeed promoted the development of blast disease symptom, indicating that they may play important roles in the barley-<italic>M. oryzae</italic> interaction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition, multiple genes which have not yet been reported as players in the plant-microbe interactions were also picked up by this study from both rice and the blast fungus. Further experiments with rice plant will elucidate the exact roles of these genes in pathogen-triggered cell death and plant susceptibility or resistance against the blast disease. The DSH library constructed in this study can also be used to generate stable rice transformants so that lines with aberrant disease phenotypes can be isolated by a direct screening with blast disease. Thus, the DSH assisted screening will provide a versatile and efficient tool to complement loss-of-function screening for the discovery of genes involved in the highly complex biological processes including plant disease susceptibility and potentially many other biotic and abiotic stress responses in the model and non-model crop plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">An approach of gain-of-function screening of full-length cDNAs derived from genes upregulated in the rice-<italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> interaction was established in this study, taking the advantage of an improved method of subtractive hybridization, SMART cDNA library construction, and Gateway cloning technologies.
