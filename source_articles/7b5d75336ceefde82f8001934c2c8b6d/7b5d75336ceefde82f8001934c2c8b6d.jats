However, the molecular mechanisms which govern intratumoral macrophage behavior and patient outcome are unclear. Here, we investigated whether alterations in macrophage expression of the transcriptional regulator for myeloid commitment and function, interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8), could predict survival of clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients. Transcriptional analysis of publicly available data revealed elevated IRF8 expression was associated with prolonged disease-free survival. Evaluation of protein expression within histologic sections of primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma patient samples showed intensity of IRF8 by CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages correlated inversely with stage. Survival outcomes of patients with primary or metastatic disease could be stratified on the basis of IRF8 levels by macrophages. Patients with high levels of IRF8 expression within metastatic sites had prolonged overall survival (log-rank <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, HR = 0.44, 95% C.I.: 0.23–0.84) compared to patients with low levels of IRF8 expression. When patient cohorts were further separated based on macrophage infiltration within metastatic lesions, patients with a macrophage<sup>lo</sup> IRF8<sup>hi</sup> profile had a more than 10 year increase in median overall survival compared to patients with a macrophage<sup>lo</sup> IRF8<sup>lo</sup> profile (log-rank, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001). In summary, we report that macrophage expression of IRF8 is inversely correlated with tumor mass and directly related to survival outcome. These findings support the utilization of IRF8 expression by macrophages to predict patient outcome, which may have important implications for guiding treatment decisions for renal cell carcinoma patients with metastatic disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Interferon regulatory factor-8</kwd><kwd>Renal cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>Macrophages</kwd><kwd>Tumor progression</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">R01CA172105</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40425_2019_Article_630.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine &amp; Public Health</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Oncology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Immunology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40425-019-0630-0" ext-link-type="doi">https://doi.org/10.1186/s40425-019-0630-0</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The clinical behavior of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can vary significantly from patient-to-patient, which complicates the tracking of disease progression and designing treatment paradigms. Biomarkers that correlate with progression are likely to improve management by providing indicators of tumor behavior, as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. To date, most identified biomarkers reflect tumor-intrinsic properties within the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) that, depending on which region is evaluated, may or may not express the biomarker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Stromal components that interact directly with the TME may present a more reliable representation of the aggressiveness of malignant disease. Indeed, recent findings have demonstrated that the stromal elements of the TME play a significant role in progression, response to therapy, and even prognosis at time of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">In diverse solid tumor types, including RCC, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) reside within the TME in large numbers and generally correlate with poorer outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Conversely, infiltration of macrophages characterized by an antitumor phenotype has been correlated with improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The complexity of TAM-based prognosis is supported by recent mass cytometry findings that have characterized 17 subtypes of TAMs within clear cell (cc) RCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In that study, the increased infiltration of 2 macrophage subsets in concert with a reduced accumulation of a third subtype predicted progression-free survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, the relationship between infiltration and prognosis may reflect the balance between immunosuppressive versus immune-activating subpopulations of intratumoral macrophages. Compared to bulk infiltration, evaluation of TAM behavior may therefore provide a more reliable method to predict outcome. The capacity of TAMs to transition from one functional state to another depends upon the cytokine milieu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which may influence their functional contributions. These changes are generally thought to be governed by distinct transcription factors that act as master regulators of cellular identity and function.</p><p id="Par4">Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) is a myeloid-dependent transcription factor that is indispensable for myeloid commitment and adaptive immunity through its ability to control: <italic>1)</italic> the development of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells into productive antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; <italic>2)</italic> the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, from APCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] which promotes the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>h</sub>1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells and activation of NK cells, that in turn secrete IFN-γ, an important component of antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Expression of IRF8 in the human myeloid compartment is essential for the development of adaptive immunity, whereby patients with mutations in IRF8 harbor significant deficiencies in circulating monocytes or dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, recent work from our laboratory has identified IRF8 as a previously unrecognized negative regulator of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are known to potently inhibit innate and adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition to its effects on lineage commitment, in vitro functional studies have demonstrated that IRF8-deficiency within human and murine macrophages abrogates IL-12p40 production in response to IFN-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">While IRF8 acts as a regulator of lineage commitment and macrophage responses to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], less is known regarding the importance of IRF8 as a transcriptional marker of TAM behavior and disease progression in human malignancies. Recent studies performed in our laboratory demonstrate that IRF8 expression in macrophages is important for an anti-metastatic program in preclinical models of mammary cancer and melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We extended these studies here to address whether the level of IRF8 in nephrectomy and metastatic tissues from ccRCC patients could be correlated with disease progression. These studies evaluated IRF8 expression by TAMs and provide the first evidence that protein expression of this transcription factor is decreased in advanced stage patient specimens and can be used to predict long-term survival in a subset of ccRCC patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>TCGA data analysis</title><p id="Par6">The results reported here, in part, are based upon data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov/tcga" ext-link-type="url">https://www.cancer.gov/tcga</ext-link>. ccRCC patient data including clinical and gene expression profiles were obtained from TCGA and cBioPortal.

TMAs were constructed from 0.6 mm tissue cores from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks and arrayed into a new recipient paraffin block. A previous study showed that 3 to 4 cores from each sample gave optimal statistical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; therefore TMAs were constructed using 3 cores from each sample.</p><p id="Par8">4-μm sections were cut, placed on charged slides, and dried at 60 °C for 1 hour.

We focused our analysis on ccRCC to reduce variability of immune infiltration associated with diverse disease types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. TCGA data were analyzed using R studio and CIBERSORT to identify intratumoral expression of IRF8 transcripts and to estimate macrophage infiltration, respectively, in patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Based on availability of outcome data, we evaluated disease-free and overall survival and found that patients with high levels of IRF8 expression had longer disease-free survival than those with low IRF8 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). No significant difference was observed for overall survival between patients with high and low levels of IRF8 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1A). We used CIBERSORT deconvolution of TCGA data to identify patients with low and high levels of TAMs. Although no difference in overall survival was observed based on TAM infiltration (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1B), we found that patients with low levels of TAMs had prolonged disease-free survival (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Combining these transcriptional comparisons of TAM infiltration with IRF8 expression, patients with high levels of both macrophage infiltration and IRF8 expression had significantly longer survival compared to patients with high levels of TAMs and low IRF8 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Increased IRF8 transcriptional levels are associated with improved disease-free survival in renal cell carcinoma. <bold>a</bold> Transcriptional analysis of IRF8 expression and macrophage infiltration was performed from TCGA data.

However, IRF8 expression can emanate from additional tumor-resident populations, including human tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and therefore our initial findings could be influenced by TAM-independent factors. To specifically address the influence of IRF8 expression within TAMs on outcome, we co-stained primary human ccRCC nephrectomy samples with IRF8 and CD68 to detect expression of IRF8 by TAMs. The clinical characteristics of the 155 ccRCC patients (94 males and 61 females) who had primary nephrectomy samples contained within our cohort are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Our key findings that IRF8 expression by TAMs within both primary and metastatic disease was a better prognostic indicator of survival than TAM infiltration suggests that the behavior of TAMs can be represented by the status of master or major transcriptional regulators. Functionally, TAMs can also directly or indirectly influence infiltration and differentiation states of other key leukocyte subsets, including effector T cells that can promote local anti-tumor responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">A potential limitation of this study, however, is that the analysis was based on conventional pathologic microscopic evaluation, compared to digital methods.
