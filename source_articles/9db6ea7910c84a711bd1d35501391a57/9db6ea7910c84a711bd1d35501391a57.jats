How HPVs overcome the significant barriers of the skin immune system has been the topic of intensive research. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins have emerged as key players in the deregulation of host innate immune pathways that are required for the recruitment of effector cells of the immune response. Here we demonstrate that E7 and to a lesser extend E6, strongly reduce NFκB activation in response to the inflammatory mediator imiquimod. Moreover, we establish that undifferentiated keratinocytes do not express the putative receptor for imiquimod, TLR7 and as such are stimulated by imiquimod through a novel pathway. Inhibition of imiquimod induced cytokine production required residues in the CR1 and CR3 regions of E7 and resulted in reduced nuclear translocation and acetylation of the p65 sub-unit of NFκB. The results provide further evidence for a TLR7-independent role of imiquimod in the epithelial immune response and reinforce the ability of the HPV oncoproteins to disrupt the innate immune response, which may have important consequences for establishment of a chronic infection.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>13</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep12922.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small dsDNA viruses that infect the squamous epithelial cells of the skin epidermis, oropharyngeal and anogenital mucosa. Infection with HPVs is associated with a spectrum of clinical lesions, ranging from common warts to cancers. Greater than 100 types have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and they are classified as either low- or high-risk, depending on the association with cancer development. High-risk HPVs are responsible for the majority of cervical cancers and a growing sub-set of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and amongst these HPV16 is detected in the majority of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Carcinogenesis is linked to persistent infection with a high-risk virus that may last several years. This suggests that HPVs have evolved mechanisms to evade the immune system.</p><p>Several studies have focussed on the immune evasion capabilities of HPV and have demonstrated that three of the virus encoded proteins; E5, E6 and E7 can impact upon the host’s ability to mount an effective immune response. E5 is the lesser understood of the three oncoproteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. It is a viroporin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> that has been correlated with decreased cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and reduced activation of the adaptive immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. E6 and E7 co-operate to down-regulate expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and the chemo-attractants MCP-1 and MIP3α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In addition, they increase expression of the anti-inflammatory molecule IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. As part of their immune evasion repertoire, both E6 and E7 have been shown to manipulate intracellular signalling pathways to inhibit activation of critical anti-viral transcription factors including NFκB and Interferon Regulatory Factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>Keratinocytes are the target for HPV infection. Studies have shown that keratinocytes can detect a wide range of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and respond by secreting a variety of cytokines and chemokines. These chemokines in turn recruit more specialised immune cells to the site of infection and initiate an immune response. The molecular basis for pathogen detection is an area of active investigation. Keratinocytes express a number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs respond to a range of viral PAMPS including dsRNA (TLR3), hypomethylated DNA (TLR9) and ssRNA or imidazoquinoline compounds (TLR7/TLR8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The transcription factor NFκB is activated by a number of inflammatory stimuli, including those sensed by TLRs and plays a critical role in mediating anti-viral responses by regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons (IFNs). NFκB is activated by phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitory IκB protein, which frees NFκB heterodimers to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they participate in the transcription of NFκB target genes, including CCL20 and IL-6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. NFκB transcriptional activity is also controlled by post-translational modification of the NFκB sub-units. These include acetylation of the p65 sub-unit, which regulates the DNA-binding abilities of NFκB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p>Given the critical role of keratinocytes in eliciting the skin immune response to infection and the chronic nature of HPV infection, we sought to further understand the interplay between TLR signalling pathways and virus immune evasion strategies in primary human keratinocytes. We show that keratinocytes mount an inflammatory response to a variety of virus-associated TLR ligands including the putative TLR7 ligand imiquimod. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that NFκB activation in response to imiquimod is independent of TLR7 in keratinocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the major HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 are able to block NFκB activation in response to imiquimod treatment and that this is mediated by changes to nuclear translocation and p65 acetylation. Together these data provide further evidence for the TLR-independent activity of imiquimod and highlight the extensive immune evasion capacity of HPV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Expression of HPV E6/E7 inhibits NFκB activation in response to viral PAMPs in primary keratinocytes</title><p>The host immune response is critical for determining clearance or persistence of HPV infection. It has now become widely accepted that in addition to skin resident immune cells, infected keratinocytes can also act as sentinels and will respond to the presence of microbial PAMPs to activate the NFκB transcription factor and drive a programme of cytokine and chemokine gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Despite this prominent role in initiating an immune response, their specific ability to respond to virus-associated PAMPs is not fully understood. To gain a clearer insight, we transfected primary human keratinocytes with a plasmid that drives luciferase expression from three copies of the NFκB response element<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and treated cells with a panel of defined TLR ligands (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The TLR3 ligand poly-I:C, a synthetic analogue of double stranded viral RNA, lead to the strongest activation of NFκB, as judged by levels of luciferase relative to untreated control (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Keratinocytes also responded to treatment with the TLR9 ligand CpG-ODN and the imidazoquinoline imiquimod, a putative ligand for TLR7, although to a lower extent (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To verify the results using a more physiologically relevant indicator, we analysed the media from mock and treated samples for levels of the chemokine CCL20 (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). As NFκB-dependent gene products, their expression was increased upon stimulation with all three TLR agonists and their relative levels mirrored the data obtained using the luciferase reporter system. Expression of the major HPV16 oncoproteins, E6 and E7, is correlated with reduced activation of immune signalling pathways in a number of experimental systems. To determine whether their expression impacted upon TLR-mediated NFκB activation in a physiologically relevant setting, primary human keratinocytes stably expressing a bicistronic E6/E7 transcript were assessed in parallel to control cells. Our findings support previously published data demonstrating that HPV oncoproteins dampen the inflammatory response mediated by TLR3 and TLR9 to varying levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. They also provide the first evidence that E6/E7 expression suppresses signalling emanating from a putative TLR7 ligand in keratinocytes (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). It was important to ascertain whether the results obtained may have been as a result of overexpressing exogenous proteins. To control for this keratinocytes were generated expressing the NS3/4A protease of Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV), a protein previously demonstrated not to modulate innate immune signalling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In agreement with our previous findings, expression of NS3/4A did not change levels of NFκB-driven luciferase in response to the ligands tested (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that during a HPV infection, expression of the HPV oncoproteins would lead to an overall dampening of the innate immune response in the presence of virus PAMPS.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>HPV16 oncoproteins disrupt TLR-mediated inflammatory signaling in primary human keratinocytes.</p><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Primary human foreskin keratinocytes stably transduced with virus expressing pBabe-Puro empty plasmid, pBabe-Puro-16E6/E7 oncoproteins or BVDV NS3/4A as a negative control were transfected with an NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. A Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRLTK) served as a transfection control. Transfected cells were subsequently treated with ligands to activate the anti-viral TLR proteins TLR3 (poly-I:C), TLR9 (CpG DNA) and TLR7 (Imiquimod) for 16 hours, before cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and analysed using a dual luciferase system (Promega)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

However, recent findings suggest that imiquimod may have a more direct effect on epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This additional action has been suggested to occur independently of TLR7/TLR8 receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. To address this point we undertook a high-resolution analysis to uncover the transcriptional profiles of each of the TLR present in primary human keratinocytes (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The deep RNA sequencing technique (RNA-seq) permits the identification of multiple transcripts in a single sample in an unbiased manner and can also be adapted to give quantitative data on transcript abundance. Accordingly, total polyadenylated cellular RNA was isolated from undifferentiated human foreskin keratinocytes, reverse transcribed and total cDNAs were subjected to Illumina deep sequencing. The resulting short reads were processed and aligned to the human genome using the Integrated Genome Viewer. Quantitative data on the abundance of individual transcripts was obtained by normalising the number of reads to the length of the gene i.e. using reads per kilobase (of the gene) per million mapped reads (RPKM), a value indicative of the transcript’s abundance. Using this approach, transcripts were detected that aligned with TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR6, TLR9 and TLR10 although they were of relatively low abundance compared to the highly-expressed β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin transcript. We did not detect any reads (and therefore transcripts) corresponding to TLR4, TLR7 or TLR8. Thus our results demonstrating the effects of imiquimod treatment on NFκB activation and secretion of the cytokines IL-6 and CCL20 in primary keratinocytes indicated an activity beyond TLR7 or TLR8. To validate these findings, keratinocytes were treated with imiquimod or an additional TLR7 ligand called CL264. CL264 is a 9-benzyl-8 hydroxyadenine derivative shown to trigger NFκB activation at significantly lower concentrations than imiquimod. In these assays imiquimod but not CL264 was able to induce NFκB-driven luciferase expression (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and this was complimented with increases in CCL20 secretion from treated cells (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). To verify that CL264 was functional, HEK293 cells stably expressing TLR7 were incubated with imiquimod and CL264. In contrast to primary keratinocytes both ligands induced secretion of CCL20 and IL-6 into the cell media (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Finally, to underscore the TLR-independent nature of the actions of imiquimod in this system, keratinocytes were pre-treated with a 26 amino acid peptide that blocks dimerization of the critical TLR adaptor protein Myeloid Differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. As TLR7 signals through MyD88, addition of this peptide would be expected to block any TLR-mediating signalling event in response to imiquimod treatment. As can be seen, addition of the MyD88 blocking peptide had no significant effect on imiquimod induced CCL20 secretion but was able to effectively prevent CCL20 secretion in response to CpG-DNA, a TLR9 ligand, which signals through MyD88 (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Taken together these data indicate that primary human keratinocytes mount an inflammatory response to imiquimod that is independent of the canonical imiquimod receptor, TLR7.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TLR expression profile in primary keratinocytes.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Transcript</p></th><th align="center"><p>RPKM</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Beta-2-microglobulin</p></td><td align="center"><p>26.54</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLR1</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.05</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLR2</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.16</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLR3</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.09</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLR4</p></td><td align="center"><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLR5</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.05</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLR6</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.56</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLR7</p></td><td align="center"><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLR8</p></td><td align="center"><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLR9</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.05</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TLR10</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.01</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Levels of TLR mRNAs in primary human keratinocytes were quantified from RNA-Seq data using the Cufflinks program with output expressed as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RKPM).

We addressed whether E7 negatively regulates imiquimod-induced NFκB activation by acting upstream or downstream of the critical IKK complex, which plays a key role in the activation of NFκB in response to a number of stimuli. To this end, keratinocytes stably harbouring empty plasmid or 16E7 were transfected with a constitutive active form of IKKβ in conjunction with the NFκB-driven luciferase reporter construct. As shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, IKKβ increased NFκB-driven luciferase levels above an empty plasmid control. Cells expressing E7 retained significantly decreased levels of luciferase activity, despite equal expression of the DA-IKKβ as determined by western blot. This result suggests that E7 negatively regulates imiquimod-induced NFκB activation by acting downstream of IKKβ. To test whether impaired NFκB transactivation was caused as a result of reduced nuclear import we stimulated control, wild-type E7 and E7∆3 expressing keratinocytes with imiquimod and enriched for the nuclear fraction. Samples were probed with antibodies directed against GAPDH (cytoplasmic) and Lamin B (nuclear) to verify the efficacy of the fractionation (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).

They can function as instigators of epithelial inflammation and are able to sense the presence of invading microorganisms, including viruses, as they encode a repertoire of PRRs. Keratinocytes are also important producers of antimicrobial molecules. Detection of virus encoded PAMPS culminates in the secretion of a milieu of cytokines that serve to activate and recruit key effector cells of the skin immune response. Despite this clear role for keratinocytes as instigators of the skin immune response, there are still many unresolved questions concerning the molecular basis for pathogen detection, intracellular signalling events in the infected keratinocyte and cellular interactions in the epidermis. Epitheliotropic viruses that establish chronic infections have evolved complex mechanisms to evade and subvert the skin immune response. In this regard, there is considerable literature to suggest that HPV utilises several strategies to dampen the host immune response.</p><p>We sought to address some of these outstanding issues by treating primary keratinocytes with a panel of ligands known to stimulate anti-viral PRRs and to determine whether HPV encoded oncoproteins were able to inhibit the inflammatory response. We show that E6 and E7 inhibited the activity of the transcription factor NFκB in response to a range of anti-viral PRR ligands including the putative TLR7 ligand imiquimod. As a consequence, keratinocytes secreted reduced amounts of NFκB-dependent cytokines including IL-6 and the chemo-attractant CCL20. Reduced CCL20 secretion would have a detrimental effect on the ability of keratinocytes to recruit circulating antigen presenting cells to the site of infection. Of note, HPV infected skin lesions demonstrate significant reductions both in CCL20 expression and the number of infiltrating Langerhans cells compared to uninfected controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Reduced migration of effector cells to the site of virus infection would enable HPV to evade local detection by the immune system and contribute towards its ability to persist in the infected host.</p><p>Whilst there is previous evidence for inhibition of TLR3 and TLR9 signalling by HPV oncoproteins, less is understood regarding potential evasion of TLR7 mediated immunity in keratinocytes. We demonstrated that both E6 and E7 were able to suppress NFκB activation in response to imiquimod, although levels were reduced more in the presence of E7. There is controversy surrounding the role of TLR7 in activating the skin immune response to compounds including imiquimod. It has been proposed that the anti-viral properties of imiquimod are mediated by activation of TLR7 or TLR8 in skin infiltrating mononuclear cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, isolated keratinocytes mount a robust inflammatory response to imiquimod treatment. In addition, it has been reported that undifferentiated keratinocytes do not express TLR7 or TLR8 and that imiquimod instead exert its effects on this population of cells through an alternative pathway, which may require adenosine receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. To investigate this, we used RNA-seq to study the transcriptome of primary keratinocytes. This allowed us to study cellular gene expression in great depth and with high specificity. The results of the sequencing analysis confirmed that undifferentiated primary keratinocytes do not express TLR4, TLR7 or TLR8. We verified these data using alternative TLR7 ligands, which were unable to induce cytokine production in primary keratinocytes but were capable of stimulating HEK293 cells stably expressing TLR7. Moreover, a small peptide inhibitor of MyD88 signalling also failed to prevent to imiquimod induced cytokine secretion in keratinocytes but was able to effectively block TLR9 mediated signalling. Similar findings have also been shown with imiquimod treated splenocytes from MyD88-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p>This unidentified pathway induced NFκB activation in response to imiquimod treatment as evidenced by reporter assays and resulted in the production of NFκB-dependent cytokine production (IL-6 and CCL20). Interestingly, this pathway was also effectively inhibited by E7 expression. A panel of established E7 mutants was used to map the functional requirements for NFκB inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We found that E7 proteins containing a point mutation in the CR1 region (H2P) or a small internal deletion in CR3 (amino acids 75–77) were unable to repress NFκB activation to the same level as wildtype E7 and secreted cytokine levels similar to the control samples. One mechanism by which E7 perturbs imiquimod signalling might be by preventing the nuclear entry of NFκB sub-units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. We confirmed that E7 partially suppresses p65 nuclear translocation and that the CR3 mutant that is unable to inhibit NFκB activation to control levels was still able to impair nuclear translocation. These data suggested that E7 might prevent NFκB activation by additional mechanisms. For example H2 and CR3 regions might be required to interact with cellular proteins that are essential components of the NFκB signalling pathway. In this regard, previous studies have linked an interaction between E7 and the histone deacetylase P/CAF with suppression of host cell transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. NFκB-dependent transcription requires multiple co-activator proteins, including histone acetyltransferases such as P/CAF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In particular acetylation of lysine residues including K310 on the p65 sub-unit are essential for effective DNA binding by NFκB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Using acetylation specific antibodies we demonstrated that p65 acetylation was reduced in imiquimod treated cells expressing E7. These data suggest that E7 may interfere with histone acetyltransferase activity to suppress NFκB activation. In support of this, mutation of the second amino acid of E7 (H2P) reduced the binding of E7 to P/CAF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In our assays this mutant was unable to suppress NFκB activation and cytokine secretion in response to imiquimod. Whilst it is currently not known if the E7∆3 can bind P/CAF, it should be noted that a second study identified a point mutation in the CR3 region of E7 that ablated binding to P/CAF in a yeast-2-hybrid assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Together, these data suggest that multiple regions of E7 may be required for the interaction with P/CAF.</p><p>From several studies and our data it can be concluded that keratinocytes respond to imiquimod through at least two pathways. One that requires TLR7 and may be active in differentiated keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and a second, poorly characterised, pathway in undifferentiated cells that lack TLR7 expression. By targeting NFκB signalling, E7 effectively suppresses the anti-viral response to activation of either pathway. Our study now adds a further example of E7 immune evasion and suggests that expression of HPV oncoproteins provides a broad spectrum dampening of the cytokine response from infected keratinocytes that would suppress the recruitment of effector cells to the site of infection and help explain HPV persistence in the epidermis. Furthermore, our findings are of importance for clinical treatment of epithelial infections and lesions since the inflammatory response of topical imiquimod application seems to be closely linked to the therapeutic effect. It has not yet been deciphered to what extent the efficacy of imiquimod relies on the epidermal response. Therefore, to further optimise treatment effect to side effect ratio and efficacy a better understanding of the response pathways to imiquimod will impact further pharmacotherapy developments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cell lines and viruses</title><p>Primary human foreskin keratinocytes were cultured as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.
