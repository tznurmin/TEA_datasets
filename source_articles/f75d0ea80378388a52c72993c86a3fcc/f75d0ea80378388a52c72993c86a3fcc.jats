VL is common in the Indian sub-continent including Nepal and efforts for its elimination are ongoing. However, expansion of disease towards the higher altitude areas, previously considered as VL free in Nepal, may impact the ability to achieve the elimination target by 2020.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This was an exploratory study, where VL suspected patients living exclusively in the non-program districts of Nepal and presenting with fever &gt; 2 weeks and splenomegaly was included.

It is high time to focus the VL control program in non-program districts to achieve the elimination goals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">All four districts (Chitwan, Dang, Sindhuli and Dolpa) with cases positive by molecular tools are located in the VL non-program districts. Chitwan and Dang districts are located in the lowland areas (250–2500 asl) of Nepal while Sindhuli is in the hilly region (300–3000 asl) and Dolpa is in the mountain region (1500–7500 asl) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Chitwan district is located along the bank of Narayani river (one of the 3 largest rivers in the country) while Dang is located in the valley. Chitwan and Sindhuli are in an immediate geographical proximity to endemic districts, there will be higher chance to transmit the diseases in those districts due to the movement of people. Although the Government of Nepal, Ministry of Health and Population is committed to eliminate VL by 2020, the rise in incidence of cases from non-program districts could be a major obstacle in achieving the set target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The serial reports of such incidences may be attributed to the possibility of spread from program districts or the presence of VL parasites in non-program districts, and it was largely overlooked in the past. The study on vector dynamics was conducted at two high altitude districts of Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and found local VL transmission. But extensive vector and parasite infection studies are yet to be conducted so as to ascertain the presence of parasite in other non-endemic areas with reported VL cases.</p><p id="Par26">Ten years data of VL patients from both program and non-program districts presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b clearly demonstrates an increasing trend in non-program districts. Increasing developmental projects/improved connectivity and trade/tourism in recent years have posed high risk of VL through the introduction/transmission of vector and <italic>Leshmania</italic> infected individuals into the non-program districts. And, the outcome is the presence of VL in areas previously thought to be free. VL prevalence is strongly associated with poverty and access to health care facilities in developing countries including Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In Nepal’s rural settings, houses with damp earthen floors are common, an ideal breeding site for sandflies, however data on actual distribution of the vector is lacking. Awareness raising programs and government support reduced the overall VL cases in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] though largely overlooked in non-program districts. Global rise in temperature could play a vital role in increased adaptability of the vectors which subsequently increases the habitat area for the vector borne diseases pathogens worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Rising socioeconomic status of local people and their enhanced accessibility to patient diagnosis and parasites detection could also have impacted this incidence. Previously inaccessible places or places without proper health facilities have now improved situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] both in private and government sectors. Nevertheless, the increasing case reports is a fact, though the reason behind it might not be explained by a single attribute instead it could be a cumulative outcome of multidimensional circumstances and needs to be properly investigated and addressed.</p><p id="Par27">The VL control program has greatly benefited from rK39 test, however it is inadequate when it comes to elimination phase due to declining positive predictive values. Despite the claimed sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the rK39 test (antibody detection) has several shortcomings, such as need of expert clinical interpretation, false positive results due to post-recovery antibody retention for years and among residents of VL endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and time required for detectable antibody production delaying the diagnosis. To address this gap, a more specific test is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and PCR is a better alternative due to the following advantages: applicable to varieties of samples at early acute phase helping transmission reduction by timely diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], less invasive than bone-marrow aspiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], prompt species identification (<italic>L. donovani</italic> complex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and improved sensitivity/ specificity using buffy coat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], Although we did not compare the diagnostic performance in our setting due to small sample size, PCR is certainly useful in a country embarking elimination like Nepal where malaria, typhoid, tuberculosis, brucellosis and leptospirosis are co-endemic.</p><p id="Par28">Our study provides important insights into the VL expansion to non-program districts which is strongly supported by use of PCR/sequence homology-based method in VL confirmation. However, due to the limited resources in our exploratory study, we could not collect larger number of samples and carry out necessary diagnostic tests for more conclusive results. Similarly, distribution of vector and parasites prevalence in all non-program districts was not studied. Not all the patients underwent bone marrow aspiration for diagnosis since the rK39 had discordant results with PCR for some patients. A small amount of blood was collected on filter paper and used for DNA extraction which might compromise the DNA concentration although we did not confirm it.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par29">With the rising number of VL cases reported from non-program districts of Nepal, it has become imperative for formulating new strategies that can overcome the present hassle of elimination obstacles as well as prevent an impending epidemic in low to high mountainous areas. Therefore, these findings should be considered as a signal for inception of a robust strategic plan for accommodation of non-program districts in the elimination program. Moreover, innovative strategies including molecular investigation should also be institutionalized to understand the origin and spread of these strains especially at this pre-elimination phase of VL.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the technical support provided from Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (NAST) and staff and patients of STIDH.</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Consent of publication</title><p id="Par30">Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par31">The research work was part of an internal program of Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (NAST) and no external funding was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par32">Most of the data analyzed during this study are included in this article.
