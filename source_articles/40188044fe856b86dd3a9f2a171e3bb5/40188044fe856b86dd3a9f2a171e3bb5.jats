However, the cross-talks between tumor epithelial cell, stromal cells, and immune cells are yet to be fully elucidated. The present study aims to determine the role of chemokine and neutrophil derived cytokine paracrine axis in mediating the interaction between tumor cells, stromal myofibroblasts, and neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">To identify myofibroblasts and neutrophil derived specific proteins affecting progression of prostate cancer, bioinformatics analyses were firstly performed in independent human prostate cancer gene expression data sets from the GEO data bank. Expression of stromal myofibroblasts secretory chemokine CXCL1 and neutrophil derived cytokine LCN2 was evaluated in prostate tissues via immunohistochemistry assay. We further investigated the effect of CXCL1 and LCN2 on prostate cancer using in vivo and in vitro models, and explored the underlying signal transduction pathways.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A CXCL1-LCN2 paracrine network was confirmed in prostate cancer tissue samples, which was correlated with the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. Of note, CXCL1-LCN2 axis activates Src signaling, triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), consequently promotes the migration of prostate cancer cells, leading to enhanced tumor metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our findings may provide enhanced insight into the interactions of carcinoma-stromal cells and immune cells linked to prostate cancer progression, wherein CXCL1-LCN2 axis is a key contributor to prostate cancer cells migration.

one of the most common malignant tumors, with the second-highest cancer-related mortality among men worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The appearance of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or metastasis is often a sign of ultimate ultimately cancer mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Development of CRPC or metastasis can be attributed to intrinsic cancer cell transformation or a combination of tumor and host interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Increasing evidence indicates that both tumor microenvironment and tumor-associated inflammation play critical roles in disease progression. Cytokines, growth factors, as well as matrix metalloproteinases secreted by stromal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, are believed to support carcinoma cell survival even under low androgen conditions and promote both local tumor growth and distant metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, chemokines (i.e., CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL12) overexpressed in prostate carcinoma activate proliferation-related pathways and stimulate angiogenesis, recruit immune cells infiltrating into cancerous foci, and trigger tumor-associated inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">CXCL1, a CXC family chemokine, is a newly discovered molecule to be overexpressed in PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The PCa metastasis secretome study further suggests CXCL1 functions as a paracrine factor and may play a role in PCa bone metastasis by mediating cross-talk among multiple cell types within the tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recent study indicates that obese patients with PCa have increased CXCL1 expression. Moreover, CXCL1 overexpression is essential for the obesity-dependent tumor adipose stromal cells recruitment and ultimately promotes PCa progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Considering the primary biological function of this chemokine, itâs likely that overexpressed CXCL1 also recruits neutrophil to tumor microenvironment, which was proven in some other types of cancer such as breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Tumor-associated inflammation and immune-cells like macrophages infiltration also contribute to PCa progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has been found that neutrophils play a critical role in cancer biology and tumor development as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a significant predictor of decreased PCa-specific survival and overall survival in patients that underwent radical prostatectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, the role of tumor associated neutrophil on PCa progression is still unclear. As CXCL1 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 are expressed in both PCa cells and neutrophil, this chemokine may be a critical link in tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Here we questioned whether overexpressed CXCL1 in PCa as well as potentially recruited neutrophil might exert any influence on tumor cells by paracrine cytokine secretion. However, an integrated understanding of PCa progression in the context of input from cancer cells together with associated stromal cells and immune cells requires further investigation.</p><p id="Par11">This study started with our interest in analyzing the potential link between CXCL1 and neutrophil-derived cytokines in the context of PCa. This effort led us to discover a network composed of PCa cells, stromal cells, and immune cells, which render a paracrine axis-centered chemokine CXCL1 and inflammatory cytokine LCN2 in conferring malignant phenotypes to PCa cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bioinformation analysis</title><p id="Par12">Eighteen independent microarray data sets of primary PCa (GSE7307, GSE6369, GSE37199, GSE36135, GSE35373, GSE33455, GSE3325, GSE32982, GSE32448, GSE26910, GSE22606, GSE21887, GSE17951, GSE17906, GSE17483, GSE17482, E-TABM-948, and E-MEXP-1243) were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

LCN2 is mainly synthesized and secreted from neutrophil and plays a role in the innate immune response to bacterial infection by sequestrating iron from pathogens. Unlike IL8/CXCL8 which has been extensively investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], only very few studies suggested LCN2 also involved in PCa progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

This study sheds light on tumor-associated inflammation and tumor progression by investigating the interaction between PCa cells and surrounding cells. Our results point to a new paracrine activation loop between PCa cells, stromal myofibroblasts, and neutrophils involving CXCL1 and LCN2, which are shown to confer a more invasive phenotype to cancer cells by activating Src family kinases and EMT. These results support a working model that CXCL1 release occurs when myofibroblasts are associated with PCa cells, which further drives the enrichment of neutrophil-derived LCN2 and together enhances cancer cells migration.</p><p id="Par46">Previous studies have revealed that primary human prostatic stromal cells do not affect the growth of prostate epithelial cell lines but stimulate its motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the present study, CM from naÃ¯ve WPMY-1 only slightly promoted cancer cells proliferation whereas this effect was dramatically magnified when stromal cells were pretreated with culture supernatant from tumor cells. Of note, it appears that the stimulating effect of co-culture on LNCaP is not as prominent as observed in the PC3 and DU145 cells, which are androgen insensitive and more aggressive cell lines. These results indicate that prostate tumor cells, especially those with a high-malignant phenotype, may be more likely to take advantage of the tumor microenvironment for survival and metastasis by reciprocally interacting with stromal cells.</p><p id="Par47">In order to collect and investigate cytokines in culture medium as well as different types of cells separately after co-culture experiment, we used TranswellÂ® system instead of 3D co-culture. Interestingly, current findings suggest that indirect contact between PCa cells and myofibroblasts induces the release of a storm of cytokines and chemokines including CXCL1, IL-6, and IL-8/CXCL8. Recent reports show that Kallikrein-related peptidase-4 from PCa cell culture supernatant stimulates IL-6 production from WPMY-1, which is an upstream regulator of CXCL1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this study, increased IL-6 may further boost CXCL1 secretion in cancer cellsâWPMY-1 co-culture systems. Unlike the chemotactic effects of CXCL1 on PCa cells reported by Kuo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], present study demonstrates that CXCL1 stimulation predisposes tumor cells to a more aggressive behavior by binding to specific receptorsâCXCR1/2. More importantly, for the first time, our data show that high CXCL1 expression in the stroma of prostatic cancerous foci is an independent prognostic factor of early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. These data suggest that CXCL1 may be a promising biomarker to distinguish high-risk PCa.</p><p id="Par48">As a primary target cell type of CXCL1, neutrophil plays an obscure role in the tumor microenvironment and have thus become a focus of research only in the last few years. In spite of its well-recognized shorter lifespan than monocytes/macrophages or lymphocytes, the role of neutrophils in tumor-associated inflammation is still worthy of thorough investigation, in particular considering its abundance among white blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. LCN2 is a proinflammatory cytokine that can be secreted by activated neutrophils, and it was recently found to be overexpressed in various types of solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It has been reported that LCN2 can form a complex with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), thereby preventing MMP-9 degradation and enhancing its activity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which may also enhance tumor invasion. Newly published studies show that overexpression of LCN2 in PCa cell lines promote cell motility and invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, our in vitro data confirm that instead of cancer cells themselves, neutrophils, especially those co-cultured with cancer cells, are the major source of LCN2 and may contribute to the abundant LCN2 in tumor foci. This was consistent with the identified correlation of CXCL1-CD177-LCN2 in cancerous foci of the prostate in our clinical samples, shown by Opalâ¢ multiplex IHC technique.</p><p id="Par49">Furthermore, our work demonstrates that both increased CXCL1 and LCN2 in the tumor microenvironment confers a more aggressive phenotype upon cancer cells via the activation of Src family kinases. Hyperactivation of Src kinase is displayed in previous studies and is responsible for inappropriate activation of androgen receptors by nonsteroids in PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. On the other hand, our data indicates that long-term exposure of PCa cells on CXCL1 and LCN2 also triggers EMT, which is a well-known speculated mechanism of tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. As shown in our study, it likely explains the enhancement of PCa metastasis in mice model. Of note, CXCL1 and LCN2 synergistically enhance tumor malignancy, indicated by the profound promotion of DU145 migration that occurs from the stimulation with both cytokines. Together with our findings, this implies that CXCL1-LCN2 paracrine axis may trigger a cascade amplification event that promotes PCa metastasis. Moreover, the present study indicates that CXCR1/2 antagonist and Src family inhibitors or Ã-catenin inhibitors may be promising pharmacological approaches in the treatment of advanced prostate carcinoma. Although a previous phase II clinical trial using Src kinase inhibitor, saracatinib, to treat PCa was terminated, which is likely due to the low rate of randomized patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], it is still worthy to further explore the application of these kinds of inhibitor for PCa treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Our study still has some limitations. First, it was seen that CXCL1- or LCN2-treated PCa cells showed much higher invasiveness in a nude mice tail vein injection model. Nevertheless, it would be more convincing to investigate in vivo tumorigenesis promoting effects of stromal cells or neutrophils using reliable animal models in which CXCL1 or LCN2 from the above cells can be functionally silent or abrogated. Second, it is still unclear how LCN2 activates Src signaling in PCa cells, considering LCN2 neutralizing antibody was not available. These issues require further detailed investigation in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par51">Taken together, our results provide mechanistic insights into the interaction between PCa cells, stromal cells, and innate immune cells in tumor microenvironment and highlight the role of CXCL1 and LCN2 in a tumor-stroma paracrine axis in promoting cancer-cell aggressivenessÂ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This study raises the possibility of clinically targeting this loop and related Src pathway to treat advanced PCa. Based the current investigation, future studies are recommended to further test the therapeutic potential of Src family inhibitors for the treatment of castration-resistant PCa.
