Here we demonstrate that mice deficient for REGγ, a proteasome activator, show significantly attenuated intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated cancer in dextran sodium sulfate model. Bone marrow transplantation experiments suggest that REGγ’s function in non-haematopoietic cells primarily contributes to the phenotype. Elevated expression of REGγ exacerbates local inflammation and promotes a reciprocal regulatory loop with NFκB involving ubiquitin-independent degradation of IκBɛ. Additional deletion of <italic>IκBɛ</italic> restored colitis phenotypes and inflammatory gene expression in <italic>REGγ</italic>-deficient mice. In sum, this study identifies REGγ-mediated control of IκBɛ as a molecular mechanism that contributes to NFκB activation and promotes bowel inflammation and associated tumour formation in response to chronic injury.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">REGγ is a component of ubiquitin-independent 20S proteasome that targets many regulatory proteins for degradation.

IBD is a worldwide health-care problem with significant morbidity. Development of IBD involves a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, intestinal microbial flora and immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Genome-wide searches for IBD susceptibility loci have successfully identified 163 gene loci that contribute to disease susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Among these genes are the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) family members Rel (also known as c-Rel) and Rel A (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>), known as key regulators of inflammatory gene expression. Moreover, many pro-inflammatory mediators, such as CXCL5, KC, MIP2, IL-6 and IL-1β are significantly related to IBD. In addition, genes involved in regulation of proteasome functions, such as <italic>USP34</italic>, <italic>WSB1</italic>, <italic>BRE</italic> and the NFκB regulator <italic>TNFAIP3/A20</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>) are among the IBD susceptibility candidates. In the past several decades, advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis in IBD have been made, partly owing to mouse models, which display similar features to UC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. UC is characterized by diffuse mucosal inflammation limited to the colon. Substantive mucosal ulceration occurs in the colon area with secretion of massive inflammatory mediators and coincident severe inflammation. Moreover, large numbers of neutrophils are often present in the lamina propria and the crypts. In addition, goblet cell mucin is lost. However, many more IBD predisposing factors are yet to be identified, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be characterized. The dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis model is an experimental murine model of UC. Although DSS model is not equivalent to human IBD, It has been widely used in the study of bowel inflammation and IBD.</p><p id="Par4">A link between inflammation and cancer has been made for about two millennia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. It is now known that inflammatory diseases increase the risk of developing cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Colon cancer is the third most common cancer in males and the second in females worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Patients with UC or CD are at higher risk for the development of colon cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Excessive production of cytokines, chemokines, matrix-degrading enzymes and growth factors in lesions is widely considered as a key factor contributing to tumourigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A combination of DSS and azoxymethane (AOM) serves as a good model system for the study of colitis-associated cancer development (CAC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">REGγ, also known as PA28γ, 11sγ, PSME3 and Ki antigen, belongs to the 11s family of proteasome activators that bind to and activate 20s core proteins. It degrades a series of target proteins in an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent manner, suggesting a novel regulatory path<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. REGγ is involved in the regulation of a broad range of important physiological processes, including cancer progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, hepatic lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. REGγ may also play a role in the regulation of innate immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, little is known about its mechanisms in the regulation of inflammatory diseases or its relationship to inflammation-associated cancer. Here we investigate its role in innate immunity and tumour micro-environment.</p><p id="Par6">NFκB signalling plays a pivotal role in inflammatory responses, immune responses, cell growth, tissue differentiation and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In resting cells, NFκB is maintained in an inactive, cytoplasmic state in complexes with the IκB family inhibitory proteins. The canonical IκBs comprise IκBα, IκBβ and IκBɛ (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>). Although IκBα is known as the primary regulator of NFκB in response to inflammatory cytokines, no physiological function of IκBɛ outside the haematopoietic compartment has been established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Two distinct degradation pathways regulate IκB levels, the well-described stimulus-responsive IKK- and βTRCP-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) pathway, and a constitutive degradation pathway pertaining to free IκB, not bound to NFκB (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). In the case of IκBα, this pathway is solely dependent on the 26S proteasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, for IκBɛ, the constitutive degradation pathway has not been characterized to the best of our knowledge.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we have investigated the roles of REGγ in inflammation response, DSS-induced colitis and CAC development using mouse models.

To determine the recognition specificity by REGγ, we analysed amino acid sequences among the three IκBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1230">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). It appears that the major differences among these IκBs are within the N-terminal 60 amino acids. We generated an IκBɛ construct with deletion of the N-terminal 60 amino acids (GST-IκBɛΔN60). GST pulldown experiments using the GST-IκBɛΔN60 suggested the binding of REGγ to IκBɛ via its N-terminus (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>).

The NFκB pathway has been appreciated as a key pathway in IBD development. Increased expression and activity of NFκB is well documented in the inflamed intestinal mucosa and macrophages of IBD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Application of NFκB inhibitors, including curcumin and parthenolide, successfully attenuated bowel inflammation in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, further demonstrating the central role of NFκB activation in the development of IBD (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>). However, the mechanisms and roles of NFκB signalling in intestinal immunity remain less clear. Several studies suggest that NFκB activation may have an essential protective role against intestinal inflammation. For example, mice lacking NEMO in IEC (NEMO<sup>IEC-KO</sup>) displayed a spontaneous development of colon inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Furthermore, mice with IEC-specific ablation of IKK2 developed more severe DSS-induced colitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and had excessive production of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine with parasite infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that NFκB activation in epithelial cells is necessary for preserving intestinal immune homoeostasis, while other reports indicate constitutive NFκB activation may induce inflammation and tissue damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. An important question is how to reconcile these seemingly contradictory observations. Perhaps maintaining NFκB activity within a normal range is crucial for natural defense against intestinal inflammation. Either too much or too little NFκB activation might be detrimental to the intestinal homoeostasis. Consistent with these notions, reciprocal positive-feedback regulation between REGγ and NFκB in IEC harbours the risk for run-away NFκB overactivation and development of bowel inflammation and CAC in DSS models. By analysing the correlation between <italic>REGγ</italic> and IBD in published database (ID:GSE10616), we found no significant changes in <italic>REGγ</italic> expression between CD and normal controls. However, the UC group had elevated <italic>REGγ</italic> expression, suggesting that CD and UC are two different forms of IBD.</p><p id="Par26">The UPS plays an important role in the activation of the NFκB pathway. Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκBs is central to activating NFκB. However, we now further reveal that IκBɛ is subject to REGγ-proteasome-dependent degradation, which thereby neutralizes these protective effects in <italic>WT</italic> mice. So far, most of the REGγ target proteins can also be degraded by ubiquitin-dependent pathway. We have proposed that under physiological condition, REGγ mainly degrades target proteins to maintain relatively lower steady-state levels. Pathological increase of REGγ upon DSS treatment may tip the balance between ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent degradation pathway.</p><p id="Par27">Interestingly, no previous physiological functions in inflammation or innate immune defenses have been established for IκBɛ. Here we have defined KC, MIP2α and CXCL5 as IκBɛ-regulated genes in colon epithelial cells and elucidated REGγ as a specific regulator for IκBɛ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1230">Supplementary Fig. 4C</xref>), expanding our knowledge to the IκBɛ regulatory pathway. Although <italic>in vitro</italic> immune responses of bone marrow-derived immune cells from WT and <italic>REGγ</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are not significantly different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1230">Supplementary Fig. 7A–D</xref>), we did observe contributions from immune cells to the development of DSS colitis with <italic>in vivo</italic> model (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), reflecting that REGγ affects both haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic compartments in the DSS model.</p><p id="Par28">Homoeostasis of NFκB signalling requires a balance between positive and negative feedback regulatory network. The NFκB target genes, including IκBs and A20, play critical roles in termination of the active canonical NF-κB pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In our study, NFκB induces <italic>REGγ</italic> to produce a positive-feedback upregulation of NFκB via REGγ-dependent degradation of IκBɛ. Because of specific binding between REGγ and N-terminus of IκBɛ (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>), but not for other negative regulators such as IκBα, IκBɛ seems to be the only factor involved in the NFκB/REGγ regulatory loop. Identification of this non-canonical degradation pathway for IκBɛ may explain why the degradation dynamics are different between IκBɛ and IκBα. Given that IκBɛ shows slower regulatory dynamics than IκBα, it is likely that regulation of IκBɛ may be particularly relevant to control of homoeostatic or chronic inflammation. Since both <italic>IκBɛ</italic> and <italic>REGγ</italic> are NFκB-response genes, the resulting feedback circuit may function to provide constitutive control but is subject to pathological derailment in inflammatory colitis. Consistent with this notion, we found increased expression of REGγ in colon epithelial cells in experimental colitis as well as in specimen from human UC, partially interpreting the tissue-specific and cell-specific effects of the REGγ-proteasome action.</p><p id="Par29">Abundant publications suggest that increased inflammation is closely associated with elevated NFκB signalling and tumourigenesis. We have recapitulated this scenario by demonstrating that <italic>REGγ</italic> depletion attenuates both intestinal inflammation and colon tumourigenesis. Our findings highlight a crosstalk between the canonical NFκB pathway and a non-canonical proteasome pathway that underlies the molecular mechanism in the development of IBD and intestinal tumour formation. By no means have we excluded the possibility that other REGγ target proteins (IκBɛ-independent mechanisms) may also be involved in the complexity of the experimental bowel disorder and CRC. Elevated p53 may explain why there is no significant differences in apoptosis between <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>REGγ</italic><sup>−/−</sup> colitis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1230">Supplementary Fig. 7E</xref>), despite the known fact that IEC apoptosis contributes to the development of UC.</p><p id="Par30">Given the key roles of NFκB hyperactivation in IBD, proper control of NFκB activity remains an attractive approach for the treatment of IBD. A variety of established anti-inflammatory agents including glucocorticoids, methotrexate and anti-TNFα antibodies are known to inhibit the NFκB pathway, at least in part. However, none of these components is specific for the NFκB pathway, and it may thus show variable responses. Given that both hyperactivation and absence of NFκB signalling are detrimental to intestinal health, direct inhibitors of IKK or NFκB may be risky. Furthermore, current proteasome inhibitors produce severe side effects, thus preventing wide clinical application. Our discovery of a specific REGγ-dependent pathway to tune NFκB activity via IκBɛ may provide an opportunity to develop new molecules targeting the non-canonical (11S Cap) proteasome degradation pathway to attenuate but not abolish NFκB as an alternative therapeutic strategy for IBD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cell culture and expression constructs</title><p id="Par31">HCT116 and HEK293T (ATCC) cells were grown in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
