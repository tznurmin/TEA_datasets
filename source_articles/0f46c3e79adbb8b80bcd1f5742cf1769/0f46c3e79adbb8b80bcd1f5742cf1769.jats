ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] that belongs to the <italic>Orthoreovirus</italic> genus in the <italic>Spinareovirinae</italic> subfamily of the <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. ARV is ubiquitous in poultry flocks, and some strains can lead to severe diseases, causing huge economic losses. The association between viral arthritis and ARV has been conclusively determined. In addition, ARV is also thought to be related to pericarditis, hepatitis, respiratory and enteric disease and malabsorption syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Previous report revealed that ARV-induced apoptosis raises infectious virus yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and several studies focused on the role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of ARV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The tissue injury at the late stage of infection is a likely consequence of ARV-induced apoptosis, but more details about the early stage of ARV infection need to be clarified in order to better control ARV infection. It was reported that ARV-induced autophagy, prior to apoptosis, also promotes its replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The following researches further illustrated the connection between ARV-induced autophagy and apoptosis, and identified the significance of inhibiting autophagy in the suppression of ARV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In general, autophagy is an intracellular degradation process that can be triggered to confront viral infections by forming double-membraned autophagosomes targeting cytoplasmic virions or viral components and leading to autolysosomal degradation. On the other hand, viruses have evolved many strategies to manipulate the autophagy pathway, exploiting autophagy machinery for multiplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Autophagy can be triggered by ARV through specific pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but how ARV takes advantage of autophagy needs to be further illustrated.</p><p id="Par18">A report emphasized that ARV induced inflammatory response (secretion of IL-1β and IL-6) and delayed apoptosis in the early stage of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Another report indicated that activated autophagy can elevate the biosynthesis and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, our previous research also found that the expression of the receptor of IL-1β (IL-1R) was upregulated in the early stage of ARV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All these findings point to a possible connection between ARV-induced autophagy and the inflammatory response, which may be helpful in explaining some symptoms in ARV infection.</p><p id="Par19">As previous studies were all conducted in vitro, verifying whether ARV induces autophagy and whether it is effective to modulate autophagy to control ARV replication in complex in vivo environments are urgent research priorities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>ARV infection induced autophagy in chicken tissues</title><p id="Par20">To determine whether autophagy is induced upon ARV infection in vivo, Western blotting analysis was utilized to monitor the change in the abundance of LC3-II protein in the lysates of chicken tissues. After that, ultrastructural analysis of the targeted tissues was performed by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The data showed that, compared to uninfected tissues, the conversion from endogenous LC3-I to LC3-II was significantly increased in the heart, liver, kidney, caecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius from the ARV-infected group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Though higher amounts of LC3-II were detected in ARV-infected spleen, lung and thymus, the accumulation was not pronounced. However, the basal conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II in mock-infected pancreas was extremely high and even higher than that found in the ARV-infected groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in different chicken tissues.

We examined TEM images of the heart, caecal tonsil and bursa and found that the double-membrane vesicles, in which cytosolic components or organelles were sequestered, were significantly increased in ARV-infected tissues compared with mock-infected tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and c, accumulated autophagosomes were observed in ARV-infected cardiac myocytes and were absent in uninfected cells. Mitochondria with abnormal appearances, such as swelling, disorganization and reduction or vanishing of the cristae, were also observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The gap between myocardial fibers was filled with autophagic structures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). The amounts of autophagosomes observed in ARV-infected caecal tonsils were also greater than those present in normal cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d and f). The precursor of the autophagosome, termed the phagophore, in which portions of the cytoplasm and mitochondria were sequestered, was clearly shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, with an incompletely closed double-membrane structure (indicated by the arrow). Several autophagic vacuoles at different stages of degradation were discovered in ARV-infected bursal cells, and early initial autophagic vacuole (AVi) and degradative autophagic vacuole (AVd) are shown (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h). The AVi can be identified by its contents (morphologically intact cytoplasm, including rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria) and the limiting membrane that is partially visible as two bilayers separated by a narrow electron-lucent cleft. The AVd can be identified by its contents and partially degraded, electron-dense rough ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The tangentially sectioned inner membrane was also detected (indicated by the arrow in the enlarged Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM observation of heart, caecal tonsil and bursa.

Chloroquine (CQ), which can block the formation of autolysosomes and lead to the accumulation of LC3-II at the late stage of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], was used as an inhibitor of autophagy.

The LC3 proteins are involved in phagophore formation and are the most widely monitored autophagy-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The accumulation of LC3-II and the appearance of autophagosomes in ARV-infected heart, caecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius were particularly notable (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The intestine-associated lymphoid tissues, such as caecal tonsil and bursa, are thought to be primary viral replication sites after oral inoculation of ARV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Two early studies indicated that ARV could penetrate the intestine by infecting certain epithelial cells, which might be intestinal microfold cells that overlie the lymphoid tissues and interact with the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. After prior infection, the replication of ARV and the expression of IL-1β were correlated with the development of autophagy in these immune tissues (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Autophagy can be stimulated by ARV infection and plays a positive role in ARV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; then, activated autophagy contributes to the biogenesis and secretion of IL-1β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Consequently, more immune cells are recruited and can be infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and carry ARV into the circulatory system.</p><p id="Par28">Pericarditis or myocarditis can be common in ARV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The results of this report showed that the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was most significant in the heart, and the classical structural features of autophagy (mitochondrial damage) were observed in myocardial tissue (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A previous study of mammalian reovirus (MRV) identified that MRV only causes cytopathogenic effects in cardiac myocytes but not in cardiac fibroblasts, which is thought to be the determinant of reoviral myocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The severe autophagy combined with the secretion of IL-1β (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) may be one of the important inducements of the myocarditis in ARV infection.</p><p id="Par29">Blocking the formation of autolysosomes by CQ led to more accumulation of LC3-II and greatly reduced the viral load in ARV-infected tissues (especially in bursa) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These results are in accordance with in vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Except that, CQ treatment significantly decreased the ARV-induced expression of IL-1β in all detected tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The data in this study suggests the relationship between autophagy and ARV infection in vivo, but more detailed mechanisms need to be further studied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">In conclusion, autophagy is utilized to promote viral replication at the early stage of ARV infection.
