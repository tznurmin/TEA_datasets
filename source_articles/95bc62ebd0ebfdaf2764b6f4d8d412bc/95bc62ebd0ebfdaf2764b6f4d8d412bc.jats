id="Par3">The adaptation of bacterial pathogens to new hosts and specific microenvironments within the body typically occurs via the combined gain and loss of genetic elements during the evolution of the species. <italic>Y. pestis,</italic> the causative agent of plague<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, represents an exceptional system for understanding how a pathogen adapts to new host environments to cause disease due to its recent emergence as a human pathogen and its relatively clonal nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The divergence of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> from its progenitor species <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> occurred within the last 10,000 years through multiple distinct genetic gains and losses, resulting in strikingly different modes of transmission and pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The soil- and water-borne enteropathogen <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> causes the mild, self-limiting disease yersiniosis and is transmitted by the faecal–oral route<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In contrast, <italic>Y. pestis</italic> is transmitted by fleabites or aerosols, and causes the severely invasive and virulent disease plague<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Investigations on the genetic history of 118 annotated genomes of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> have revealed an evolutionary lineage that has defined both early ancestral (branch 0) and modern pandemic (branches 1 and 2) populations of <italic>Y. pestis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> based on sequential single-nucleotide polymorphism changes (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>pPCP1 is required by ancestral <italic>Y. pestis</italic> to cause primary pneumonic plague.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Genomic maximum parsimony tree and divergence based on 16 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> genomes.

This change in disease and transmission is attributed to both the acquisition of new chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA and as well as through genomic decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. For example, the genes encoding for O-antigen synthesis on its lipopolysaccharide are inactivated in <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, resulting in a rough form of lipopolysaccharide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. <italic>Y. pestis</italic> also contains disruptions in the genes for the adhesins invasin and YadA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, both of which are functional in <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a recent study by Sun <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> has described only four minor genetic changes that were necessary for the flea-borne transmission of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, which contributed directly to the ability of this pathogen to cause bubonic plague. In addition, the gain of the two plasmids pMT1 and pPCP1 that encode genes contributing directly to survival and virulence in both the flea and mammal is an apparent distinction of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> as it evolved from <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5"><italic>Y. pestis</italic> can cause bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic plague in mammals. Of these, pneumonic plague is a unique respiratory syndrome that results in a purulent, multifocal, severe exudative bronchopneumonia and is the deadliest form of the disease, with fatality rates approaching 100% if untreated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The disease is characterized as biphasic: the early phase is relatively asymptomatic and non-inflammatory, while the latter phase is highly pro-inflammatory, resulting in massive lobar lesions consisting primarily of infiltrating neutrophils, upregulation of cytokine and chemokine levels, and bacterial dissemination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">One of the major virulence determinants encoded on the pPCP1 plasmid that is required for the development of pneumonic plague is the protease Pla. Similar in sequence and structure to OmpT of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and PgtE of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, this β-barrel omptin family aspartic protease has been shown to have a wide range of proteolytic, adhesive and invasive properties necessary for <italic>Y. pestis</italic> pathogenesis in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. While the most well-studied activity of Pla is the cleavage of host plasminogen (Plg) into the activated serine protease plasmin, to date only the host apoptotic molecule Fas ligand (FasL) has been defined <italic>in vivo</italic> as a substrate of Pla that contributes to primary pneumonic plague<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The amino-acid sequence of Pla is 100% conserved among all modern branched strains of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>; however, comparative genomics and substitutional analyses indicate that the sequence of Pla has shifted since the gene was introduced into ancestral branched strains of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In ancestral lineages such as Angola and Pestoides, Pla contains a single isoleucine substitution at position 259 (I259) located on the surface loop 5, whereas the modern lineages KIM and CO92 have a conserved threonine at this residue (T259)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This single change has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to increase the efficiency of Plg activation and plasmin stability formed by the T259 variant of Pla<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The acquisition of pPCP1/Pla is positioned as an early occurrence in the emergence of pandemic strains of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>; however, there still exist ancestral isolates, such as Pestoides E and F (isolated from voles in the Transcaucasian highland)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, that represent an intermediate lineage between <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> and modern <italic>Y. pestis</italic> and do not carry pPCP1. However, these naturally occurring isolates of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> that do not harbour pPCP1 have nevertheless been reported to both colonize fleas and infect rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Moreover, DNA of the pPCP1 plasmid, containing the modern T259 variant of Pla, has been detected in the remains of victims from both the Justinian plague and the Black Death, implying that most pandemic strains contained the genetic potential to be as virulent as strains currently associated with human disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">This study was undertaken to identify and examine when during its emergence <italic>Y. pestis</italic> gained the ability to cause severe primary pneumonic plague. By utilizing the deeply rooted, ancestral Pestoides and Angola lineages, we demonstrate that the specific microevolutionary event of pPCP1/Pla acquisition contributed directly to the adaptation of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> to the respiratory environment, and no additional genetic changes were necessary to cause pneumonic plague. On the other hand, our results indicate that the T259 modification of the Pla protease enhanced systemic disease, suggesting that <italic>Y. pestis</italic> was primed to cause a fulminant pneumonia before its ability to efficiently cause invasive infections. Finally, we propose that the I259T substitution of Pla may have been one of the defining events that enabled pandemic spread of <italic>Y. pestis.</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ancestral strains of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> rapidly outgrow in the lungs of mice</title><p id="Par9">It is not known as to when during its emergence from the gastrointestinal pathogen <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> that ancestral <italic>Y. pestis</italic> gained the ability to cause severe primary pneumonic plague. To address this question, we examined the capacity of the deeply rooted, ancestral <italic>Y. pestis</italic> strains Angola, Pestoides A, E and F (branch 0) (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), which display biochemical phenotypes and have environmental niches that are distinct from modern pandemic lineages and have not been associated with human disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, to establish an infection in the lungs. We compared the bacterial outgrowth of these strains to that of the well-studied, modern-positioned lineage strains CO92 and KIM (branches 1 and 2) (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), both isolated from human plague cases, in an intranasal (i.n.) mouse model of pneumonic plague. We found that both Angola and Pestoides A, ancestral branched strains that carry pPCP1 (although with the I259 variant of Pla), are able to replicate to high levels in the lungs, approaching or equivalent to the bacterial burdens of the modern lineage strains CO92 and KIM (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). On the other hand, the Pestoides E and F strains are unable to rapidly proliferate in the pulmonary compartment (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), suggesting the absence of one or more virulence determinants required to cause primary pneumonic plague.</p><p id="Par10">A comparison of these strains showed that a major distinguishing feature between Angola and Pestoides A versus Pestoides E and F is the presence of pPCP1, the plasmid encoding the virulence factor Pla; neither Pestoides E nor Pestoides F naturally carry pPCP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1516">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, we found that all of the pPCP1<sup>+</sup> strains are able to synthesize Pla to similar levels, however both Angola and Pestoides A do not autoprocess Pla due to the I259 variant of the protease carried by these strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).
