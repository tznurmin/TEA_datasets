Our studies show that early-life RSV infection leads to differential long-term effects based upon the sex of the neonate; leaving male mice prone to exacerbation upon secondary allergen exposure while overall protecting female mice. During initial viral infection, we observed better viral control in the female mice with correlative expression of interferon-β that was not observed in male mice. Additionally, we observed persistent immune alterations in male mice at 4 weeks post infection. These alterations include Th2 and Th17-skewing, innate cytokine expression (<italic>Tslp</italic> and <italic>Il33</italic>), and infiltration of innate immune cells (DC and ILC2). Upon exposure to allergen, beginning at 4 weeks following early-life RSV-infection, male mice show severe allergic exacerbation while female mice appear to be protected. Due to persistent expression of TSLP following early-life RSV infection in male mice, genetically modified TSLPR−/− mice were evaluated and demonstrated an abrogation of allergen exacerbation in male mice. These data indicate that TSLP is involved in the altered immune environment following neonatal RSV-infection that leads to more severe responses in males during allergy exposure, later in life. Thus, TSLP may be a clinically relevant therapeutic target early in life.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer

the first 2 years of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> This viral infection is the leading cause of childhood hospitalization and increases the risk for developing childhood asthma and recurrent wheezing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> The health burden costs of RSV

rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Recent pre-clinical and clinical data, including data from our laboratory, suggest that severe RSV disease is associated with an altered innate and adaptive immune response, characterized by excessive Th2 and Th17 immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Numerous studies have shown that RSV plays a role in reducing innate cytokine production that is necessary for appropriate anti-viral responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Both viral replication as well as immunopathology can lead to RSV disease symptoms and probing these and potentially other underlying disease mechanisms that are supported by clinical data will be important for therapeutically targeting the immune environment.</p><p id="Par3">During a viral infection, the immune response is strongly dictated by dendritic cells (DC) because they activate the immune system and instruct T cells toward distinct T helper type responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> RSV can skew the immune response away from anti-viral and towards a Th2-type response by inhibiting the production of IFN-β and subsequently decreasing the Th1 pro-inflammatory response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> This lack of an anti-viral response as well as skewing towards dysregulated Th2/Th17 has been correlated with severe disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> leading to airway restructuring linked to exacerbated allergic responses later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Up to 48% of infants who were hospitalized for severe RSV-associated bronchiolitis and/or lower respiratory tract infection go on to develop asthma during their childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness, affecting ~5 million children under 18 years of age, including 1.3 million children under 5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> During childhood, males have higher occurrences of asthma and wheezing than do females at a 2:1 ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> Additionally, males are approximately twice as likely to become hospitalized than females due to severe RSV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Thus, the risk for severe RSV infection and RSV-associated asthma development is higher in males than in females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">How RSV alters the immune system to influence these observed responses is currently not well defined. Previous studies with neonatal RSV infection have demonstrated that there are persistent changes in the lung that include increased mucus production and increased populations of immune cells. Specifically, type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are increased in RSV infected lungs and these cells produce IL-5 and IL-13, cytokines important in the development of inflammation and mucus production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Innate cytokines, including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25 and IL-33 are known inducers of ILC2 differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> TSLP is a known driver of Th2-type responses through its influence on DCs, T cells, and ILC2s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and may be required for CD4+ Th2 memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> RSV infection has been shown to lead to increased expression of TSLP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> which has also been implicated in asthma pathogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> In fact, TSLP has been suggested as a possible biomarker in pediatric asthmatics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Additionally, it has been directly shown that RSV infection leads to activated IL-13 producing ILC2s that are dependent on TSLP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> However, the mechanisms by which early life RSV infection alters immune responses related to allergen sensitization have yet to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par5">In the present study, we examined the modulated immune responses due to neonatal RSV infection that include alteration of immune cell phenotypes and subsequent persistent changes leading to the altered development of allergic responses. Specifically, we demonstrate for the first time that early-life RSV infection alters immune cell populations in neonates in a sex-dependent manner through TSLP production to affect the early development of type 2 immune responses resulting in enhanced allergic responses later in life. These results suggest that clinically targeting TSLP during early-life RSV exposure may prevent RSV-induced immune environment changes and thus may decrease the incidence of childhood asthma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Neonatal RSV infection of male and female mice leads to a strong Th2/Th17-type immune response with delayed resolution in male mice</title><p id="Par6">To evaluate the immune response to early-life RSV infection, male and female neonatal mice were infected intranasally with RSV (A2/L19-F (1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> pfu)) at 7 days of age (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Following infection, both males and females had mucus and inflammation present within their lungs peaking around 4–8 days post-infection with decreased mucus observed by 14 days post-infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). Age-matched male and female control mice show little to no signs of mucus production within the lungs at these time points (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), indicating viral induction of mucus. Additionally, at 14 days post-infection, lymphoid aggregates or bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) was observed in male mice, but not female mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). An increase in viral gene expression was observed in male compared to female mice on day 4 of infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) with female but not male mice having an increase in interferon-β gene expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), a critical cytokine required for viral clearance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> Lung draining lymph nodes, harvested from neonatally infected mice at 8 days post RSV-infection, showed a strong Th2 and Th17-type immune response, with no discernible difference between males and females (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). However, upon analysis at 14 days post-infection, males showed higher cytokine responses in restimulated lymph nodes compared to females (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). These data indicate that both male and female neonatal mice elicit an RSV-driven Th2/Th17-type immune response but male mice displayed a lack of viral control with a delay in immune contraction compared to female mice.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Neonatal RSV-infection experimental model</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41385_2019_171_Fig1_HTML.png"/></p></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Neonatal RSV infection of male and female mice leads to a strong Th2/Th17-type immune response with delayed resolution in male mice.

However, significant differences were observed at 4 weeks post-early-life RSV-infection, with persistent lung immunopathology, including visible signs of mucus still present in the lungs of male mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) but not female mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). In correlation with lung pathology, males had increased expression of the mucus gene, <italic>muc5ac</italic>, compared to neonatally RSV-infected females (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

In addition, the results showed persistent gene expression of Th2-type and <italic>Il17a</italic> in males compared to females (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

Thus, these studies outline 2 important concepts; (1) early RSV infection results in an altered immune phenotype in the lung that is dependent upon sex; and (2) the persistence of the early innate cytokine, TSLP, has a role in the altered immune environment and may be a clinically relevant target early in life.</p><p id="Par12">TSLP is an early responding, innate cytokine, that can drive Th2-type responses and is upregulated following RSV infection of lung epithelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> During neonatal RSV-infection, TSLP mediates immunopathology through OX-40/Th2 signaling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> as well as having direct effects upon ILC2 cells, causing them to produce Th2-type cytokines, IL-5 and IL-13 to enhance inflammation and mucus production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> When TSLP was neutralized during neonatal RSV infection, the severity of a later exacerbated RSV infection was mitigated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> indicating that TSLP may be creating a broadly altered immune environment.

Our data expands on these clinical findings, showing a significant correlation between RSV-induced TSLP and the subsequent development of viral-associated allergic asthma later in life in male mice, following early-life RSV-infection.</p><p id="Par13">TSLP has a wide range of immune cell targets, including ILC2, DC, and T cells. The initial biologic function of TSLP demonstrated that it interacted with DC to promote Th2 cell differentiation and thus promoted allergic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> TSLP stimulation of CD11b+ DC upregulates OX-40L that interacts with OX-40 on CD4 T cells to promote a Th2 response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> The survival and maintenance of ILC2 that produce Th2-type cytokines, depends on the presence of TSLP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> In addition, TSLP signaling instructs DCs to produce CCL-22,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> a chemokine that recruits Th2 cells through its interaction with the CCR4 receptor. Finally, in response to TSLP, DCs will themselves produce TSLP that further interacts with DCs and ILC2, creating a feedback loop that is independent of epithelial cell-derived TSLP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> The data provided in our studies, using TSLPR−/− mice, indicated that TSLP signaling is responsible for the increased presence of innate immune cells in the lungs of male mice conditioned with a neonatal RSV infection. Interestingly, the TSLPR−/− mice had a similar allergen response in the lungs compared to WT male and female mice when no neonatal RSV infection was given. These data recapitulate previous data indicating that although TSLP is involved in the development of Th2 cells, the long-term allergen responses are not altered in its absence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> Similarly, TSLP was not necessary to develop chronic Th2 driven parasitic helminth granulomatous responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> Thus, TSLP may be central to the development of chronic type 2 immune responses when a stimulus, such as RSV infection, promotes an altered immune environment that predisposes tissue to development of allergic responses.

While we have not further explored the role of IL-33 in the sex difference in the altered immune environment, it may also contribute.

This suggests that early-life RSV-infection in males leads to persistent TSLP-associated Th2/Th17 immune-driven pathology within the lungs, while the same early-life infection in females allows for appropriate Th2/Th17 resolution thereby protecting females from later asthma pathogenesis. This phenomenon may be due to poorly controlled viral replication and decreased viral clearance in males following the initial infection, possibly due to lack of type-1 interferon production, which is critical for viral clearance as well as resolution of Th2/Th17 immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> Correlating with our findings, it has previously been shown that female plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) isolated from human peripheral mononuclear cells express higher levels of type-1 interferons (IFNα/β) compared to male pDC following TLR7 stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> Studies with bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatics have shown that TSLP and interferon-β have an inverse relationship, showing a bias towards low interferon-β but high TSLP, while the reverse is true for healthy individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> A separate study has shown that type-3 interferon (IFNλ) has the ability to upregulate TSLP expression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> the role of type-1 interferons and TSLP has not been fully elucidated.
