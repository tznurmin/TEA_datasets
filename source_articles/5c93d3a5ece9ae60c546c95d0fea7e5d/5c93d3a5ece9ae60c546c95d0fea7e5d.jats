In addition, a secondary DENV infection sometimes causes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which frequently leads to death. For this reason, accurate diagnosis record management is useful for prediction of DHF. Therefore, the demand for DENV rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs) is increasing because these tests are easy and rapid to use. However, commercially available RDTs often show low sensitivity for DENV and cross-reactivity against other flaviviruses, especially Zika virus (ZIKV).</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We developed two types of novel DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) detection RDTs, designated TKK-1st and TKK-2nd kits. Specificities of the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used in these kits were confirmed by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA), dot blot, and western blot using recombinant NS1 proteins and synthetic peptides. For evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the novel DENV NS1 RDTs, we first used cultured DENV and other flaviviruses, ZIKV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). We then used clinical specimens obtained in Bangladesh in 2017 for further evaluation of kit sensitivity and specificity in comparison with commercially available RDTs. In addition, RNA extracted from sera were used for viral genome sequencing and genotyping.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Epitopes of three out of four MAbs used in the two novel RDTs were located in amino acid positions 100 to 122 in the NS1 protein, a region that shows low levels of homology with other flaviviruses. Our new kits showed high levels of sensitivity against various serotypes and genotypes of DENV and exhibited high levels of specificity without cross-reactivity against ZIKV and JEV. In clinical specimens, our RDTs showed sensitivities of 96.0% (145/151, TKK-1st kit) and 96.7% (146/151, TKK-2nd kit), and specificities of 98.0% (98/100, TKK-1st kit and TKK-2nd kit). On the other hand, in the case of the commercially available SD Bioline RDT, sensitivity was 83.4% (126/151) and specificity was 99.0% (99/100) against the same clinical specimens.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our novel DENV NS1-targeting RDTs demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and lacked cross-reactivity against ZIKV and JEV compared with commercially

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par27">Dengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the most common tropical infectious diseases transmitted through mosquitoes to human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. DENV infection is currently endemic in more than 110 countries, and the number of DENV-infected patients has been estimated to be 390 million per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], resulting in 20 thousand patient deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The symptoms of DENV infection are high fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, and rash. There are four serotypes of DENV, which are referred to as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. All four serotypes are known to cause dengue fever (DF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Although DENV infection is a big challenge for human health, no antiviral drugs targeting DENV have been approved to date. On the other hand, the first preventive vaccine for DENV infection has been approved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but, due to frequent occurrence of severe DENV cases in previously uninfected vaccines, this vaccine can be used only in previously DENV-infected cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Generally, primary DENV infection causes DF, whereas a small but non-negligible proportion of patients with secondary infection manifest the more severe symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which can cause death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has been suggested that antibodies against one serotype of primary DENV enhance the replication of other serotypes of DENV upon secondary infection, causing the more severe symptoms seen with DHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to obtain accurate patient records regarding previous DENV infection to predict the severity of ensuing disease, permitting clinical risk management of DHF. Easy access to rapid diagnosis would facilitate the generation of accurate records of DENV infection.</p><p id="Par29">Currently, there are a variety of methods for diagnosis of DENV infection such as RNA-based assays (real-time RT-PCR) and tests that detect the DENV non-structural protein (NS1) antigen and/or patient IgM/IgG (rapid detection test and ELISA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Among these diagnostic assays, the rapid detection test (RDT) is the easiest method for diagnosis of virus infection. RDTs are user-friendly and cost-effective, require no equipment, and provide results faster than PCR and ELISA. The flavivirus NS1 protein is a glycoprotein of approximately 46â50âkDa, highly conserved among the 4 DENV serotypes and even among arthropod-borne flaviviruses (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). NS1 protein is a useful infection marker for rapid diagnosis because this protein is released from infected cells into the blood stream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], accumulating in the blood of DENV-infected patients at concentrations of up to 50âÎ¼g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Accordingly, NS1 protein persists longer than the viral genome in blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Even after DENV RNA in patient blood has been degraded, NS1 protein can still be detected by RDTs. Although NS1-detecting RDTs provide useful and critical diagnostic information, these tests can cause misdiagnosis as a result of cross-reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or nonspecific reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Most cross-reactions are caused by the similarity among flavivirus NS1 proteins. The flavivirus NS1 proteins are highly conserved among the genus flavivirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and commercially available RDTs have been shown to exhibit cross-reactivity with the NS1 proteins of other flaviviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], pathogens that are endemic to geographic regions that overlap with the distribution of DENVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">RDTs have several disadvantages such as lower sensitivity and specificity than RT-PCR-based assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Notably, RDTs for DENV antigen and antibody demonstrate cross-reactivity against Zika virus (ZIKV), another flavivirus that causes symptoms similar to those caused by DENVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, patient sera might contain antibodies against DENV if patients have come to hospitals later than 7âdays after the onset of fever or if patients have been infected previously with DENV. Such pre-existing antibodies would compete with the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of RDTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and interfere with the reaction monitored by RDTs. RDT signals upon secondary infection usually are weaker than those detected upon primary infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, it would be desirable to have more-sensitive and less-cross-reactive antigen-detecting RDTs for accurate DENV diagnosis.</p><p id="Par31">Here, we report novel DENV NS1 antigen detection kits that showed high sensitivity to DENV patient sera in Bangladesh, a dengue-endemic country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The kits showed no cross-reactivity against ZIKV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Assembly of rapid detection test (RDT)</title><p id="Par32">Twelve mouse MAbs against DENV NS1 protein were purchased from Bio Matrix Research, Inc. Nagareyama, Japan (Catalog No. BMRdn). Each anti-DENV NS1 MAb was conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) (TANAKA Kikinzoku Kogyo K. K, Hiratsuka, Japan) according to the previously described method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), the AuNP-conjugated MAb was diluted to an optical density of 2.5 and impregnated into glass fibers (Millipore, Billerica, MA), which then were dried in an incubator. To prepare the detection matrix, anti-DENV NS1 antibodies were diluted to 0.5âmg/mL and immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane to permit capture of the DENV NS1 protein at a test line. Anti-Mouse IgG antibody (Protein Purify Industrial Co.,LTD, Isesaki,Japan) also was immobilized onto the nitrocellulose membrane along a control line. RDTs (dipstick format) were generated by assembling a glass fiber (sample pad), conjugate pad, nitrocellulose membrane, liquid absorbent pad, and laminate tape. Extraction buffer (including surfactant) was distributed to a 96-well plate at 60âÎ¼L/well; an aliquot (30âÎ¼L) of specimen was added to a given well and the contents were mixed gently. The RDT strip then was inserted into the well containing the mixture of extraction buffer and specimen. After 15âmin, the color intensity of the test line was measured using an Immunochromato-Reader (Hamamatsu Photonics, Model C10088â10).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Peptide-competitive ELISA of NS1 antigen</title><p id="Par33">For epitope analysis of MAbs, we prepared recombinant NS1 from each of the four serotypes of DENV (Fitzgerald Industry International, North Acton, MA) and 7 synthetic peptides (Hokkaido System Science Co.,Ltd., Sapporo, Japan) corresponding to fragments of DENV-1 NS1, including amino acids 13 to 36 (P1), 100 to 122 (P2), 135 to 151 (P3), 193 to 222 (P4), 248 to 272 (P5), 282 to 306 (P6), and 325 to 352 (P7). These peptides were designed based on the predicted hydrophilicity of portions of the DENV-1 NS1 protein.</p><p id="Par34">Amino acid sequence information for each recombinant NS1 protein was obtained from the NCBI database (DENV-1: clone 45AZ5, Accession No. NC_001477; DENV-2: S1 vaccine strain, Accession No. NC_001474; DENV-3: H87 strain, Accession No. NC_001475; DENV-4: clone rDEN4, Accession No. NC_002640).</p><p id="Par35">Recombinant DENV-1 NS1 protein was diluted with 50âmM carbonate buffer (pHâ9.5) to a concentration of 20âÎ¼g/mL, added to an ELISA plate (Nunc immune module F8 Maxi sorp, Thermofisher. Inc., USA), and incubated overnight at 4âÂ°C. Wells were blocked with 0.1% BSA in 50âmM carbonate buffer for 1âh at 37âÂ°C. After 3 washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T), 100âÎ¼L of MAb against DENV NS1 protein with each synthesized peptide (500âÎ¼g/well) were added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 1âh at 37âÂ°C. After 3 washes with PBS-T, 100âÎ¼L of secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase (POD) conjugate, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratory, Inc., USA.; formulated at 1: 1000 in PBS) was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 1âh at 37âÂ°C. After three washes with PBS-T, 75âÎ¼L of 3,3â²,5,5â²-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 5âmin at room temperature (RT). The absorbance at 650ânm of the solution in each well was measured using a microplate reader (EnSpireâ¢, Perkin Elmer, Co., Ltd., USA).

To increase testing throughput, we used a dipstick format, which permitted completion of each test in approximately 15âmin (depending on humidity conditions). We conjugated the MAbs with AuNPs, adsorbed the MAbs onto nitrocellulose membranes, and tested all combination of MAbs by placing dipsticks in microcentrifuge tubes or the wells of a 96-well plate containing 60âÎ¼L of extraction buffer and 30âÎ¼L of sample specimen per tube or well. First, we tested recombinant NS1 proteins of all four serotypes of DENV and selected 12 combinations that showed signal/background ratios greater than 2.0.

As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the reactions of NS1 protein with MAbs were inhibited by the addition of P2; the sole exception was the reaction with the Membrane-1 MAb. Therefore, three of the MAbs (Membrane-2, AuNP-1, and AuNP-2) recognized DENV-NS1 via epitopes corresponding to amino acids 100 to 122. Since the reaction of DENV-NS1 with Membrane-1 was not inhibited by adding any synthesized peptide, it was speculated that the Membrane-1 MAb recognizes a conformation of NS1 or a hydrophilic region of NS1 protein other than the regions covered by the 7 tested peptides. Indeed, the Membrane-1 MAb did not detect DENV-NS1 by western blotting under reducing conditions but did detect DENV-NS1 by dot blotting under non-reducing condition.

All of these false-positive samples tested positive for anti-DENV IgM and/or IgG antibodies. IgM against DENV are generated at four to seven days after the onset of illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is known that NS1 proteins persist longer than the viral genome in blood. Therefore, these false positives most likely were caused by residual NS1 proteins without DENV RNA in patient specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To know whether residual NS1 proteins actually existed in these false positive samples, and to further compare the performance of TKK kits with other NS1 detection system, we carried out NS1 antigen ELISA. First, we measured two-fold serially diluted recombinant NS1 protein of DENV-2. When the ISR was above 1, the sample status was determined as positive. We found the detection limit of ELISA was 0.125âng/mL of recombinant NS1 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a), which was 10 times lower than that of RDTs (2âng/mL). When we applied the culture supernatant of isolated viruses, the InBios ELISA kit could detect 1âÃâ10<sup>4</sup> copies/mL dilution of most of the isolates except for H87 (DENV-3) and H241(DENV-4) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). These results are similar to those of TKK kits (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Finally, we selected 29 DENV-PCR positive samples with various Ct values including 5 samples which were not detected by RDTs, together with 21 DENV-PCR negative samples including IgM or IgG positive samples. The two false positive samples were also included in these sample set. Among this set of 50 samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c), sensitivities of TKK-1st and -2nd kits were 82.8% (24/29) and 86.2% (25/29), respectively, while that of the ELISA was 89.7% (26/29). Specificities of TKK-1st and -2nd kits were 90.5% (19/21) while that of the ELISA was 85.7% (18/21). These results suggested that there was no big difference in the sensitivity and specificity between InBios NS1 ELISA and TKK RDTs. In addition, we observed high levels of correlation between optical density of ELISA and color intensity of TKK kits, since Pearsonâs Correlation coefficient was 0.83 for TKK-1st and 0.82 for TKK-2nd. Furthermore, the two false positive samples were also detected by the ELISA, indicating that these two samples were in fact NS1 positive (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Detection of NS1 protein by ELISA. <bold>a</bold> Serially diluted recombinant NS1 proteins were applied to ELISA. <bold>b</bold> Culture supernatants of Vero cells infected with the indicated virus strains were serially diluted and applied to ELISA. <bold>c</bold> Correlation between ELISA and RDTs.

Additionally, real-time PCR methods have very slow turnaround times, and are prohibitively expensive in resource-limited environments. However, it is necessary to identify specific pathogens in many infectious diseases, especially those caused by arthropod-borne (mosquito- and tick-transmitted) viruses, given the markedly different risk profiles among these diseases. Therefore, resource-limited regions urgently need RDTs that are inexpensive, easy to use, do not require additional equipment, show immediate results, and can be used at all levels of healthcare systems. The present study evaluated two newly developed RDTs and one commercially available SD Bioline dengue NS1 for their utility in the diagnosis of acute dengue infection in a hospital setting. As reported here, our RDTs demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity, with sensitivity exceeding that of the SD Bioline kit in all cases, including laboratory-cultured viruses, clinical viral isolates, and sera from DENV-infected patients.</p><p id="Par62">Our kits incorporated 4 MAb clones. Among these 4 MAbs, one did not react with NS1 protein by western blot, suggesting that this MAb recognizes a conformational epitope. The MAbs in the TKK-1st kit recognized a linear epitope (located at amino acids 100 to 122 of NS1) as well as a conformational epitope of NS1, while both MAbs in TKK-2nd kit recognized linear epitopes (located at amino acids 100 to 122 of NS1) only. We analyzed amino acid sequences at positions 100 to 122 in flaviviral NS1 proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Amino acids 100 to 122 in DENV NS1 are predicted to form a wing domain, are hydrophilic, and shows low levels of identity between DENV and other flaviviruses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Generally, DF-endemic areas overlap those of Zika fever, and include regions inhabited by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitos<italic>,</italic> insects known to transmit these viruses to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These closely related co-circulating viruses cause similar clinical symptoms. Therefore, RDTs with high levels of sensitivity and no cross-reactivity would provide useful information for clinical diagnosis in such areas.</p><p id="Par63">Recently, Bosch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] developed a RDT for DENV serotyping. Those authors used MAbs against epitopes in the latter half of the amino acid 100â122 region as pan-DENV antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This position has been reported to be conserved among DENV serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that our kits would show high levels of sensitivity against various genotypes of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3, and lack cross-reactivity against other flaviviruses. In fact, our kits demonstrated high levels of sensitivity to various DENV strains and serotypes without cross-reactivity against JEV and ZIKV. On the other hand, the SD Bioline dengue NS1 kit demonstrated cross-reactivity to both JEV and ZIKV. We did not evaluate our RDTs with DENV-4-infected serum, because DENV-4 infection was not found in the patient population examined in the present study. However, the DENV-NS1 sequences in amino acid positions 100 to 122, especially in the latter half of this region, showed high levels of identity among all serotype of DENVs including DENV-4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). We therefore expect that our RDTs also will show high levels of sensitivity against DENV-4 patient sera. Notably, if human antibodies directed against amino acid positions 100â122 of NS1 are generated in infected patients, the TKK-2nd kit would be more affected than the TKK-1st kit.</p><p id="Par64">The median Ct value of the 269 total cases examined in the present study was similar to that of the cases examined in Experiment 1. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the kit sensitivity shown in Experiment 1 will be reproducible in clinics similar to Apollo Hospitals Dhaka. In contrast, the median Ct value of the cases examined in Experiment 2 was lower than that of the cases examined in Experiment 1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>). This observation presumably was the reason why kit sensitivity was higher in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1.</p><p id="Par65">We further analyzed the correlation between color intensity of the RDTs and the Ct values obtained in the present study (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Simonnet et al. reported that the results of the SD Bioline kit were difficult to judge because of the occurrence of faint bands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The color intensities provided by the TKK-1st kit and -2nd kit were apparently higher than those of the SD Bioline kit, meaning that the TKK-1st kit and -2nd kit should be easier to read and are expected to detect NS1 proteins at later time points post-infection than possible with the SD Bioline kit, given that the TKK kits can detect lower NS1 concentrations in patient sera.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Correlation between color intensity of RDTs and Ct values of DENV detection PCR.

An apparent lack of IgG and/or IgM effects on the results of the TKK-1st kit and TKK-2nd kit in Experiment 2 most likely is explained by the fact that we did not include samples with low viral load in Experiment 2. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of SD Bioline dengue NS1 Ag kit (89.7%) was still affected by anti-DENV IgG and/or IgM in Experiment 2 (68.8%), confirming that the TKK-1st kit and TKK-2nd kit showed higher sensitivities than the SD Bioline dengue NS1 Ag kit.</p><p id="Par67">Unfortunately, the sample collection day relative to the onset of illness was not available for the clinical samples used in the present study. This is an apparent weakness of the present study. We speculate that our RDTs can detect NS1 protein until high concentrations of anti-DENV IgM are generated in patients. An anti-DENV IgM antibody-based assay limited to acute-phase samples would not be sufficient for the diagnosis of DENV infection, since in the majority of DENV infection cases, anti-DENV IgM levels become detectable between day 4 and day 7 after the onset of illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. For reliable diagnosis of DENV infection, NS1 antigen-based RDTs would provide useful information in the acute phase, especially in the viremia period, while anti-DENV antibody-based RDTs would be useful in the convalescent phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the present study, our RDTs demonstrated that sensitivities were 96.0% with the TKK-1st kit and 96.7% with the TKK-2nd kit. Specificities were 98.0% with both the TKK-1st kit and TKK-2nd kit, and overall agreement with an RT-PCR based assay was 96.8% with the TKK-1st kit and 97.2% with the TKK-2nd kit. These values would be lower if the study was conducted in a tertiary hospital, where severe cases are admitted. Ideally, a combination of our novel NS1 detection kit with RDTs that detect antibodies against DENV without cross-reactivity against other flaviviruses would be employed.</p><p id="Par68">Another weakness of the present study is lack of accurate information regarding the status of infection. One hundred and thirty-two out of 151 DENV PCR positive samples (87.3%) lacked anti-DENV IgG and were theoretically judged as primary infection. However, considering the high levels of DENV seroprevalence in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], it is highly unlikely that all of these 132 cases were in primary infection. As described above, we do not know the sample collection day relative to the onset of illness. However, it is possible that many of these cases came to the hospital at earlier stage of illness before expansion of DENV IgG-secreting plasma cells, since many of the patients have high levels of DENV RNA (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>). Nevertheless, even among 19 cases with DENV IgG, the sensitivity of TKK-1st kit and TKK-2nd kit were still 84.2% (16/19).</p><p id="Par69">In addition, it has been reported that the sensitivities of many commercially available RDTs against DENV-4 are lower than those against DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

We are currently performing an evaluation of our new kits in hospitals in other countries where DENV-4 is in circulation.
