Patients usually present with dysuria, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and suprapubic pain or tenderness. Approximately 150 million people are diagnosed with UTI each year worldwide. The high recurrence rate of lower UTI is a common problem of clinical treatment. The misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of a number of resistant bacterial strains. Thus, traditional Chinese medicine is considered as an alternative option for treating acute uncomplicated lower UTI. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sanjin tablets (SJT) for the treatment of acute uncomplicated lower UTI, explore whether SJT can reduce or substitute the use of antibiotics, and reduce the recurrence rate in the treatment of acute uncomplicated lower UTI.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">In this study, a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel control of positive drug, multicenter clinical study will be established. A total of 252 patients with acute uncomplicated lower UTI (syndrome of dampness-heat in the lower jiao) will be randomly allocated in the ratio of 1:1:1 to three groups: experimental group; control group 1; and control group 2. The experimental group receives Sanjin tablets plus levofloxacin tablets (LT) placebo; the control group 1 receives LT plus SJT placebo; and the control group 2 receives SJT plus LT on the first five days, SJT plus LT placebo on the last two days. Each group will be treated for seven days and followed-up 1–2 times. The primary outcome measures of effective rate and recurrence rate are symptoms. Secondary outcome measures of effective rate and recurrence rate are the urine leukocytes, bacteriology examination, and safety assessment. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study protocol will provide the research data of efficacy and safety of SJT for the treatment of acute uncomplicated lower UTI. The first aim is to determine whether Sanjin tablets can reduce the use of antibiotics; the second aim is to determine whether Sanjin tablets can substitute the use of antibiotics. The recurrence rate will be assessed after cured to determine whether SJT can reduce the recurrence rate. The results of this study will improve the rational use of drugs, especially the rational application of antibiotics. It will also enable safety evaluation from laboratory indices and adverse events, which will provide reliable evidence for clinical treatment.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov" ext-link-type="url">NCT03658291</ext-link>.

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">Acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections. Patients usually present with dysuria, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and suprapubic pain/tenderness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the United States, there are &gt; 7 million outpatients with UTIs and about 1 million inpatients each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Approximately 150 million people are diagnosed with UTI each year worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. UTI, which can cause shock and death, ranks third among all diseases that die from infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae, is the common cause of both community-acquired and hospital-acquired UTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Many Chinese medicines that have a heat-clearing and detoxicating function have been proven to have the bacteriostasis on pathogenic microorganisms, which can inhibit or destroy the formation of toxic substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the antibacterial test against mice, it was found that Sanjin tablets (SJT) have strong bacteriostasis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">SJT have the effects of clearing heat, detoxicating, eliminating dampness, and treating stranguria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is used to treat urinal urgency, frequency, and burning caused by syndromes of dampness-heat in the lower jiao, which coincides with the symptoms of acute uncomplicated lower UTI. SJT are composed of five kinds of Chinese herbal medicines: Jinyinggen (Root of Cherokee Rose), Baqia (Chinaroot Greenbrier Rhizome), Yangkaikou (Fruit of Fiverleaf Akebia), Jinshateng (Lygodii Herba) and Jixuecao (Asiatic Pennywort Herb), all of which are recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (V.2015). Jinyinggen (Root of Cherokee Rose) is acerb and neutral in nature; it can control nocturnal emission and astringent intestine. Baqia (Chinaroot Greenbrier Rhizome) is cosin and neutral in nature; it can remove rheumatism, promote blood circulation, detoxicate, relieve convulsion, and calm endogenous wind. Jinshateng (Lygodii Herba) is slightly sweet and cold-natured; it can clear heat, detoxicate, and remove dampness. The above three herbs are monarch drugs in a prescription, which have a mutual promotion effect on the function of clearing heat, removing dampness, and inducing diuresis for treating stranguria. The above three medicines, supplemented with Yangkaikou (Fruit of Fiverleaf Akebia) and Jixuecao (Asiatic Pennywort Herb), can enhance the effects of removing dampness and treating stranguria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">SJT are a completely natural preparation with significant efficacy in treating UTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Previous clinical studies have indicated that SJT can reduce the symptoms of chronic UTI and number of acute attacks and can reduce the secretory level of urinary sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-8 in patients with chronic nephropyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Observation by electron microscope found that SJT can make <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> flagella drop without any danger. A meta-analysis has demonstrated that the current evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy and safety of SJT for acute uncomplicated lower UTI due to lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The high recurrence rate of lower UTI is a common problem of clinical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of a number of resistant bacterial strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Unfortunately, the efforts to produce new antibiotics have not been sufficient to cope with the emergence of these new antibiotic-resistant (AR) strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the objective of our study is to evaluate effectiveness, safety, and recurrence rate of SJT and explore whether SJT can reduce or substitute the use of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated lower UTI by a rigorous RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objective and design</title><p id="Par16">This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel control of positive drug, multicentre clinical study. The study will be conducted at: the XiYuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; the Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; the Hubei Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; the Affiliated hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; and the Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Ethical clearance for the trial was obtained from ethics committee of the six hospitals. Patients with acute uncomplicated lower UTI will undergo a standardized baseline evaluation before treatment, comprising detailed history taking, physical examination, and laboratory testing. All included patients are randomly divided into three groups: experimental group; control group 1; and control group 2. The experimental group receives SJT plus levofloxacin tablets (LT) placebo; control group 1 receives LT plus SJT placebo; and control group 2 receives SJT plus LT on the first five days, SJT plus LT placebo on the last two days. After seven days of treatment, the efficacy and safety of three groups will be evaluated. The first aim is to determine whether SJT can reduce the use of antibiotics (control group 2 versus control group 1, non-inferiority test); the second aim is to determine whether SJT can substitute the use of antibiotics (experimental group versus control group 1, non-inferiority test). The recurrence rate will be assessed at the 28-day follow-up after being cured to determine whether SJT can reduce the recurrence rate. The trial is conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice of Pharmaceutical Products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

LT are licensed for UTI with proven curative effect and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, levofloxacin had been selected as the active control medicine. Participants in the experimental group will receive SJT plus LT placebo orally four times a day for seven days. Participants in control group 1 will take LT plus SJT placebo four times a day for seven days. Participants in control group 2 will take SJT and LT four times a day for the first five days and SJT plus LT placebo four times a day for the last two days. Patient visits are required after seven days of treatment. This is a placebo-controlled study; all participants receive the same number of pills with varying proportions of active drug and placebo to ensure that patients and clinicians are not aware of the allocated treatment aim. The SJT placebo is composed of 55% microcrystalline cellulose, 41% starch, 2% caramel, 1.5% silicon dioxide, and 0.5% talcum powder. The LT placebo is made of 56% microcrystalline cellulose, 42% starch, 1.5% silicon dioxide, and 0.5% talcum powder. The SJT and LT placebos are similar to the SJT and LT in size, color, shape, taste, smell, and packaging.

The first aim of this trial is to determine whether SJT can reduce the use of antibiotics (control group 2 versus control group 1, non-inferiority test); the second aim is to determine whether SJT can substitute the use of antibiotics (experimental group versus control group 1, non-inferiority test). The recurrence rate will be assessed at 28-day follow-up after being cured to determine whether SJT can reduce the recurrence rate. To facilitate high validity and reliability, a strict quality control and high-quality methodology is indispensable.
