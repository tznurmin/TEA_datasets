id="ASec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Fractionated irradiation was given to the snouts of male C3H/Neu mice over 2 weeks (10 × 3 Gy), either alone or in combination with daily subcutaneous application of unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin (40 or 200 I.U./mouse, respectively). Over this course of 14 days, groups of mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3) were sacrificed every second day, their tongues excised and processed for histological analysis. The epithelial radiation response with and without heparin treatment was evaluated in terms of tissue morphology, proliferation and expression of cell contact molecules.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p>Systemic treatment with heparins significantly reduced the cellular effects of irradiation to the oral epithelium. Heparin treated animals showed significantly higher total epithelial cell numbers and thickness throughout the study course. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation analyses revealed that markedly more epithelial cells retained their proliferative capacity in the beginning of the first treatment week, but the proliferation of the mucosa was not stimulated during the rest of the study course. The expression of the adherens junction protein β‑catenin was slightly elevated in heparin treated animals, on day 2 the increase was statistically significant. The expression of e‑cadherin and occludin was mostly unaffected by the concomitant heparin treatment.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of this study indicate an interplay of additional heparin treatment with the repopulation processes, leading to an earlier onset of this adaptive radiation response in oral mucosa. Importantly, we could demonstrate that the protective potential of heparin did not rely on stimulation of normal tissue proliferation. Since both heparin preparations are already approved for clinical use, they are considered as promising candidates for future clinical studies.</p></sec></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="de" id="Abs2"><title>Zusammenfassung</title><sec id="ASec5"><title>Ziel</title><p>Untersucht werden sollten die mechanistischen Hintergründe des protektiven Effekts einer systemischen Heparingabe auf die Ausprägung der radiogenen oralen Mukositis in der Maus.</p></sec><sec id="ASec6"><title>Material und Methoden</title><p>Fraktionierte Bestrahlung wurde auf die Schnauzen von männlichen C3H/Neu-Mäusen über 2 Wochen (10 × 3 Gy) appliziert, entweder allein oder in Kombination mit täglicher s.c.

Bromdesoxyuridin(BrdU)-Inkorporationsstudien ergaben, dass deutlich mehr Epithelzellen ihre proliferative Kapazität während der ersten Behandlungswoche beibehalten hatten. Während der restlichen Behandlungszeit wurde keine zusätzliche Stimulation der Proliferation im Epithel beobachtet. Die Expression des Zellkontaktmoleküls β‑Catenin war infolge der Heparinbehandlung leicht erhöht, an Tag 2 konnte ein signifikanter Unterschied beobachtet werden. Die Expression von e‑Cadherin und Occludin wurde durch die begleitende Heparinbehandlung nicht beeinflusst.</p></sec><sec id="ASec8"><title>Schlussfolgerung</title><p>Die Ergebnisse dieser Studie deuten auf eine Interaktion der Heparingabe mit den Repopulierungsprozessen hin, was ein früheres Einsetzen dieser adaptiven Strahlenreaktion in der oralen Mukosa zur Folge hat. Zudem konnte gezeigt werden, dass der protektive Effekt der Heparingabe nicht auf der Stimulation der Proliferation im Normalgewebe basierte. Da beide Heparine bereits in der Klinik zugelassen sind, stellen sie geeignete Kandidaten für weiterführende klinische Studien dar.</p></sec></trans-abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Normal tissue effects</kwd><kwd>Radiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Animal model</kwd><kwd>Oral epithelium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group xml:lang="de"><title>Schlüsselwörter</title><kwd>Normalgewebsreaktionen</kwd><kwd>Strahlentherapie</kwd><kwd>Tiermodel</kwd><kwd>Mundschleimhaut</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003413</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical University of Vienna</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/66_2018_Article_1423.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>output-medium</meta-name><meta-value>All</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine &amp;

The majority of patients undergoing curative treatment develop a severe reaction, manifesting as painful confluent lesions and/or ulcerations of the epithelial membranes lining the oral cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Oral mucositis significantly reduces the patient’s quality of life due to mucositis-associated pain and speaking and swallowing difficulties, which often necessitate parenteral nutrition. Additionally, radiation-induced oral mucositis often leads to local and systemic infections because of disturbed mucosal barrier function. Besides the socio-economic factor due to mucositis-associated hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], these radiation-induced complications might lead to treatment interruptions thus significantly lowering the tumor control probability.</p><p>However, current treatment strategies are purely symptomatic, based on the improvement of oral hygiene and pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. So far, the only biology-based treatment approach against oral mucositis is palifermin and the recommended administration is limited to myoablative treatment only. Being a recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), the question regarding the proliferation stimulating effect on the malignant cells is still of concern and, in combination with its high costs, prevents the use of palifermin in head-and-neck patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Oral mucosa represents a turn-over tissue, with a strictly regulated equilibrium between cell proliferation in the germinal and cell loss in the superficial layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Radiation negatively impacts epithelial proliferation. Since cell loss and shedding is not affected by radiation and continues at its physiological rate, radiotherapy results in epithelial hypoplasia and consequently in complete denudation. This represents the main cause of oral mucositis and causes the loss of the barrier function of the oral epithelium against potentially toxic substances and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The integrity of the mucosal barrier is maintained via tight and adherence junction complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Tight junctions are formed by the proteins claudin and occludin and, besides the tissue barrier function, play a role in transport of water and small molecules between the cells by forming size selective channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Adherence junctions are formed by the transmembrane proteins e‑cadherin and α/β-catenin and are responsible for the interaction of the cell with the actin of the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, they act as cellular anchors and regulate the cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interaction, additionally maintaining the polarization of the cell. Besides the above mentioned mechanical properties of the cell contact molecules, they play a role in signaling within and between the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Junction complexes thus are involved not only in physiological processes such as growth, proliferation and migration but also in pathological conditions such as wound healing and inflammation. A study published in 2018 by Gruber et al. showed that the expression of epithelial junctions is upregulated in the oral mucosa of mice in response to fractionated irradiation, thus representing a novel parameter of the epithelial radiation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we described a protective and mitigative effect of systemic heparin administration for radiation-induced mucositis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Heparin belongs to the group of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) which represent a polydisperse, heterogeneous mixture of molecules with variable chain lengths, disaccharide composition and sulfation status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In clinical practice, heparins have been used for over eighty years due to their anticoagulant activity. The function of the biologically available heparin, which is released by the mast cells during inflammatory events, is still not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nowadays, a great body of literature exists proposing various binding partners for exogenously supplied heparins, including growth factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, cytokines and chemokines. Thus, apart from coagulation, heparins might play a pivotal role in the processes of proliferation, development, inflammation, infection and wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the present study was initiated to analyze the mechanistic background of the radio-protective effect of the systemic heparin treatment. Here, we particularly focus on heparin’s impact on changes in epithelial morphological parameters such as total epithelial cell number and thickness, and cell proliferation, represented by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). To analyze the effect of heparin treatment on the integrity of oral mucosa, the expression of epithelial tight (occludin) and adherence (e-cadherin and β‑catenin) junction proteins will be evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and housing</title><p>Twelve to 14 weeks old male mice of the inbred C3H/Neu strain from the breeding facility of the Department for the Biomedical Research of the Medical University of Vienna were used in the described experiments. Mice were bred and housed under specified pathogen-free conditions with controlled temperature (20–22 °C), humidity (45–55%) and a 12/12-h light–dark rhythm. Free access to standard mouse diet (Sniff Spezialdiäten GmbH, Soest, Germany) and filtered water was provided. A maximum of five animals were kept in IVC cages (Tecniplast®, Buguggiate, Italy) on aspen wood bedding (ABEDD®, Lab &amp; Vet Service GmbH, Köflach, Austria).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Irradiation technique</title><p>Fractionated irradiation with 3 Gy per fraction was applied to the whole snouts of the animals. For this, un-anesthetized mice were guided into a perspex tube (28 mm inner diameter). A conical hole at the front end of the tube served for the positioning of the animal. The rear end was closed to prevent the escaping of the animals. Up to eight mice were irradiated simultaneously. The snout of the animals, including the entire tongue, was irradiated; the rest of the body shielded by a lead equivalent.</p><p>Irradiation was performed using an YXLON MG325 X‑ray device (YXLON International GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) with a vertical beam. The X‑ray unit was operated with a tube voltage of 200 kV and a tube current of 20 mA. The dose rate was regularly controlled and accounted at the focus-to-surface distance of 45.5 cm approximately 1 Gy/min. In addition to the inherent filtration with 3 mm Be, 4 mm Al and 0.6 mm Cu beam filters were used. The commissioning of the irradiation set-up revealed dose homogeneity between the individual snout positions of ±3%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Heparins</title><p>Fractionated irradiation was combined with daily application of heparins: unfractionated heparin (UFH, heparin medicamentum; medicamentum pharma, Allerheiligen im Mürztal, Austria) or low molecular-weight heparin Lovenox® (LMWH, enoxaparin sodium; Sanofi, Paris, France). Heparins were diluted in saline and injected subcutaneously at a daily dose of 40 IU/mouse for UFH and 200 IU/mouse for LMWH, respectively, with the injection volume not exceeding 150 µL. The drug was applied two hours after irradiation and on days without irradiation approximately at the same time of day.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Fractionated irradiation was given in fractions of 3 Gy on five consecutive days per week followed by an irradiation free weekend. The maximum number of applied fractions was 10 (days 0–4, 7–11). The control experiment comprised irradiation only. When fractionated irradiation was combined with drug administration, either UFH or LMWH was given daily starting three days before the first fraction (day −3) until the last irradiation day (day 11). Starting at day 0, groups of three animals were sacrificed every second day, their tongues excised and fixed in paraformaldehyde for further histological analysis. On days of sacrifice, no irradiation or drug were applied. Non-irradiated and untreated mice served as controls. The overview of the study design is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, summarizing the irradiation and drug administration scheme.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Experimental design.

Sample sections of 4 µm were deparaffinized and rehydrated using xylene and a graded alcohol series. Heat mediated antigen retrieval in citrate buffer, pH 6, was performed by boiling the sections in a microwave at 640 W for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min. Subsequent staining procedures were performed using a Vectastain® ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). After blocking of unspecific binding sites by 2% normal serum for 1 h at room temperature, primary antibodies were applied and incubated over night at 4 °C. The secondary antibody was added for 1 h at room temperature. Then, sections were treated with the avidin–biotin complex for 30 min at room temperature. The binding of the primary antibody was visualized by 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and hematoxylin nuclear counterstain.

In the head-and-neck region, conventional radiotherapy provokes development of oral mucositis, a common severe and often dose-limiting condition. It represents a significant issue in oncology, since no effective target-based intervention has been introduced into clinical routine so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we described a muco-protective effect of systemic heparin treatment on radiation-induced oral mucositis in a pre-clinical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this study, we tested varying application intervals for UFH and LMWH in combination with single dose or fractionated irradiation regimes. Heparin treatment resulted in lower incidence of radiation-induced mucositis, prolonged the latent time until the ulcer development and reduced the mucositis duration. These effects were particularly pronounced when fractionated irradiation over two weeks was combined with daily heparin application starting three days before the first fraction until the day of the last fraction, i. e. day 11. Consequently, this therapy combination was chosen for the present study, focusing on the underlying mechanisms of the observed radio-protective effect of heparin on normal oral epithelium.</p><p>Fractionated irradiation over two weeks had a major effect on the epithelial morphology by rapidly downregulating the proliferative capacity in the germinal epithelial layer resulting in reduced total epithelial cell number and thickness. With the onset of the regenerative tissue response to radiation in the beginning of the second week of fractionation, called repopulation, epithelial cell number and thickness stabilized for the rest of study period and cell proliferation recovered, even beyond background values. These morphological changes were accompanied by elevated expression of cell junction proteins, most likely in order to counteract the continuous shedding of superficial cells and help maintaining the mucosal integrity.</p><p>When fractionated irradiation was accompanied by daily treatment with heparins, the radiation response of normal mucosa was modified. Over the course of two weeks, we observed significantly higher epithelial cell numbers and slightly increased thickness of the epithelium. The loss of epithelial cells in response to radiation was clearly less prominent and the cell numbers stabilized earlier, compared to untreated animals. These findings might explain the observation of the prolonged latent time and reduced ulcer duration in our previous study. The epithelial proliferation was mostly unaffected by systemic heparin treatment, except for day 2. Here, markedly more cells retained their proliferating capacity. It seems that heparin application provokes an earlier onset of the adaptive repopulation leading to increased radiation tolerance with the increasing overall treatment time. This might explain why the strongest muco-protective potential in our previous study was observed when irradiation was applied over two weeks. Potentially, the earlier onset of the regenerative response provoked by application of heparin leads to a decreased incidence of ulcerations. As described by Dörr et al., three major mechanisms are responsible for repopulation: acceleration of stem cell proliferation, asymmetry loss of stem cell divisions and abortive divisions of sterilized cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The pronounced muco-mitigative effect of heparin application might be related to interactions with all of these complex mechanisms.</p><p>Concerning the expression of cell junction proteins, only the levels of β‑catenin could be elevated by additional heparin treatment; the expression of e‑cadherin and occludin were marginally changed. It seems obvious that the interplay of heparin with the analyzed cell junction molecules plays rather a minor role in the muco-protective effect. The reason for maintenance of the mucosal integrity relies mostly on the higher fraction of surviving cells that keep their proliferative capacity. Important to mention is also the fact that the potential muco-protective effect of heparin is not based on stimulation of epithelial proliferation.</p><p>Both heparin preparations used in this study are approved for clinical applications and are widely used in clinical practice mostly because of their anticoagulant properties. A large body of literature exists stating that heparins, besides anti-coagulation, might play an important role in biological processes such as proliferation, infection, immune response, cell adhesion and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Since the manifestation of radiation-induced oral mucositis is a dynamic event involving multiple molecular and cellular processes in all compartments of the mucosa, further work is required in order to characterize the underlying mechanisms of heparin’s muco-protective potential in detail. Additionally, studies suggest that glycans play a crucial role in all physiological steps of tumor progression by regulating tumor proliferation, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In vivo studies could show that heparins, especially LMWH, possess anti-tumor and anti-metastatic potential and prolonged survival of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To conclude, it seems that heparin treatment supportive to anti-cancer radiotherapy has a positive protective effect on the normal oral epithelium and potentially anti-tumor effects. These properties render heparins perfect candidates for further clinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrates that the muco-protective potential of systemic heparin treatment on radiation-induced oral mucositis is partially based on the interaction with the repopulation processes, resulting in an earlier onset of this adaptive response. Additionally, we could highlight that the concomitant heparin treatment did not stimulate the proliferation of the normal tissue. Since both heparin preparations are already approved for clinical use, they seem to be promising drugs for future clinical studies. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to identify and characterize additional biological mechanisms underlying the modulatory effects and questioning the proliferation stimulating effect on the malignant cells by heparins (manuscripts in preparation).</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The financial support by the Federal Ministry for Digital, Business and Enterprise and the National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development is gratefully acknowledged.</p></sec></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by Medical University of Vienna.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical guidelines</title><sec id="FPar2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>M. Kowaliuk, I. Schröder, P. Kuess and W. Dörr declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Ethical standards</title><p>All experiments were performed according to the current animal welfare legislation with approval of the respective authorities (Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, file number BMWF 66.009/0039-II/3b/2014).</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sonis</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pathobiology of mucositis</article-title><source>Semin Oncol Nurs</source><year>2004</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>11</fpage><lpage>15</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1053/j.soncn.2003.10.003</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Elting</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooksley</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Chambers</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Garden</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Risk, outcomes, and costs of radiation-induced oral mucositis among patients with head-and-neck malignancies</article-title><source>Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys</source><year>2007</year><volume>68</volume><fpage>1110</fpage><lpage>1120</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.01.053</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Viet</surname><given-names>CT</given-names></name><name><surname>Corby</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Akinwande</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>BL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Review of preclinical studies on treatment of mucositis and associated pain</article-title><source>J Dent Res</source><year>2014</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>868</fpage><lpage>875</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="coi">1:STN:280:DC%2BC2cfjs1Ojsg%3D%3D</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1177/0022034514540174</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sonis</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy of palifermin ( keratinocyte growth factor-1 ) in the amelioration of oral mucositis</article-title><source>Core Evid</source><year>2009</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>199</fpage><lpage>205</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="coi">1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXhsVyksL3M</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2147/CE.S5995</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dörr</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Radiobiology of tissue reactions</article-title><source>Ann.
