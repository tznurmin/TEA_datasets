The extents to which these two kinases act cooperatively and distinctly in regulating LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine expression are still unclear. To address this uncertainty, whole transcriptome analyses were performed using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) generated from MK2<sup>−/−</sup> or MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> animals and their wild-type littermates. The results suggest that in BMDM, MK2 and MK3 not only cooperatively regulate the transcript expression of signaling intermediates, including IL-10, IL-19, CXCL2 and the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R)α subunit, they also exert distinct regulatory effects on the expression of specific transcripts. Based on the differential regulation of gene expression by MK2 and MK3, at least six regulatory patterns were identified. Importantly, we confirmed our previous finding, which showed that in the absence of MK2, MK3 negatively regulates IFN-β. Moreover, this genome-wide analysis identified the regulation of Cr1A, NOD1 and Serpina3f as similar to that of IFN-β. In the absence of MK2, MK3 also delayed the nuclear translocation of NFκB by delaying the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκBβ, reflecting the substantial plasticity of the response of BMDM to LPS.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Intramural research funds of the medical faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University of D&amp;amp;#x00FC;sseldorf</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bundesministerium f&amp;amp;#x00FC;r Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and Research)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">Virtual Liver Virtual Liver 0315751</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">Virtual Liver 0315731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawodny</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bode</surname><given-names>Johannes Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">190586431 &amp;amp;#x2013;

This broad spectrum of activities is ensured by the notable plasticity that enables the physiology of these cells to be altered in response to environmental cues, producing different cell populations with distinct functions. To this end, macrophages are tightly interconnected with the surrounding cell populations via the controlled release and permanent sensing of intercellular communication signals. These signals include signaling peptides such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors or arachidonic acid derivatives. In macrophages, at least in response to inflammatory pathogens, the expression of many of these mediators is controlled by the MAP kinase family member p38<sup>MAPK</sup> and its downstream effector molecules. In addition to being critical for the initiation and establishment of the inflammatory response, this pathway is part of a signaling network that—in a cell type-dependent manner—modifies intracellular signal transduction and the cellular response towards cytokines such as IL-6 according to the context of coacting signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, the p38<sup>MAPK</sup> pathway has been recently demonstrated to mediate not only the release of inflammatory mediators but also the type I interferon-dependent release of IL-10 and the subsequent prolonged activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The latter protein is critical for the de-escalation and dissipation of the inflammatory response, indicating a key role of the p38<sup>MAPK</sup> pathway in the orchestration of not only the induction but also the feedback control of the inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">An important part of the intracellular signal transduction elicited by p38<sup>MAPK</sup> is mediated via the activation of the two downstream effector kinases of p38<sup>MAPK</sup>, MAPK-activated protein kinases (MAPKAPK or MK)2 and 3. These two kinases are highly critical for the control of the expression of a variety of intercellular communication signals, including various cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, OSM, IFN-β, IL-10, CXCL2 and CXCL8. These two kinases are closely related isoenzymes and were initially demonstrated to cooperate in the regulation of inflammatory gene expression at the posttranscriptional level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, previous evidence indicates that in addition to their cooperative action, these kinases exhibit distinct regulatory roles in gene expression. Thus, at least in the context of the macrophage inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, it has been demonstrated that MK3 exerts negative regulatory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible gene expression in the absence of MK2. In particular, IκBβ protein levels and NFκB activation in response to LPS stimulation, as well as IRF3 expression, appear to be affected if only MK3 is present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is unclear to what degree the different IκBβ levels observable in macrophages deficient in MK2 alone or both MK2 and MK3 are due to reduced expression or enhanced degradation. Moreover, it is unknown, if these distinct regulatory effects of MK2 and MK3 described for the regulation of the IFN-β gene are true for LPS-inducible expression of only IFN-β or also of other genes. The present study aims to further characterize the differential impact of MK2 and MK3 on LPS-induced gene expression in macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Deletion of MK2 or deletion of both MK2 and MK3 strongly alters gene expression in response to LPS</title><p id="Par4">We previously demonstrated that in macrophages, the expression of the IL-10 gene in response to LPS requires MK2-mediated upregulation of IFN-β gene expression, activation of the IFN-α receptor (IFNAR) 1 and accumulation of the IL-10 transcript, which, in turn, is MK2/3-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Consistent with these findings, sustained IL-10 expression in response to LPS was significantly downregulated in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) that lacked MK2, an effect that - at least during early time points - tended to be enhanced upon the additional deletion of MK3 in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In contrast to this pattern but consistent with previous data from our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, the induction of IFN-β expression, which, in contrast to that of IL-10, occurs rapidly and is short-term, was impaired in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages and restored upon the additional deletion of MK3 (MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) compared to that in wild-type control cells (wt BMDM). Notably, in macrophages that lack only MK3 (MK3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM), LPS-inducible expression of the IFN-β gene was not significantly affected (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1b</xref>), suggesting that MK3 only exerts its effects on the expression of genes such as IFN-β in the absence of MK2.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>LPS-induced transcript expression of IL-10 and IFN-β is controlled by the interplay of MK2 and MK3.

However, it is not clear whether this effect is limited to IFN-β or is generally applicable to additional target genes. To answer this question, gene expression in response to LPS treatment was analyzed via whole genome array analyses in BMDM prepared from the bone marrow of MK2<sup>−/−</sup> and MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> animals as well as from the corresponding control animals after 2 and 6 h of treatment with 100 ng/ml LPS.</p><p id="Par6">In this approach, the analysis was restricted to 33,325 out of 55,819 probes referring to genes related to NCBI listed accession numbers. Since several genes were proven by transcript expression with multiple probes, a total of 24,288 genes were included in the analysis. A response to LPS was considered relevant when the expression of the respective gene was significantly up- or downregulated, with a p-value of at least 0.05, upon treatment of the cells with LPS. Accordingly, after 2 h, a total of 11,768 genes and after 6 h, a total of 16,563 genes were significantly up- or downregulated independent of the genotype. Next, these genes were separated by genotype, and the results are presented in Venn diagrams (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). In wild-type macrophages, 6,580 transcripts (27% of the analyzed 24,288) exhibited a change in their expression after 2 h of treatment with 100 ng/ml LPS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), while in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> and MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages, 8,264 (34%) and 8,982 (37%) of the genes, respectively, were influenced in response to LPS treatment. The overall number of genes responsive to LPS increased to 10,081 (42%) in wt BMDM and to 13,311 (55%) or 12,962 (53%) in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> or MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), when stimulation with LPS was extended to 6 h.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>LPS-responsive genes controlled by MK2 and/or MK2/3: Whole genome array and the top 25 MK2/3-dependent genes with the strongest induction.

In total, 24,288 genes with known functions were analyzed and integrated into Venn diagrams when significantly up- or downregulated upon LPS treatment (t-test, p &lt; 0.05). The numbers indicate the number of genes belonging to the indicated subset. The percentages reflect the ratio of the analyzed total genes. The red circles represent differentially regulated genes under wild-type conditions; blue, under MK2<sup>−/−</sup> conditions; and green, under MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> conditions. From these genes, those with a minimum expression change of 4-fold from wild-type conditions were further analyzed after 2 (<bold>c</bold>) or 6 h (<bold>d</bold>) of LPS treatment. The top 25 differentially expressed genes with MK2- and/or MK2/3-dependency are listed.

Hence, these data indicate that, in addition to being critical for the regulation of gene expression in macrophages in response to LPS, MK2 and/or MK3 are required to prevent a large number of genes from being regulated by LPS or from contributing to feedback regulation of the LPS response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Analysis of the differential regulation of LPS-inducible gene expression in macrophages by MK2 and/or MK3 reveals six different modes of regulation</title><p id="Par8">Next, we aimed to focus on the LPS-responsive genes that were upregulated in wt BMDM and differentially regulated in the absence of either MK2 alone and/or both MK2 and MK3.

Of the 24,288 genes analyzed after 120 min of LPS treatment, 682 were identified to meet these criteria, and this number increased to 1,065 genes after 360 min of stimulation with LPS. From these genes, identified as LPS-responsive, the expression level within each genotype (wt, MK2<sup>−/−</sup>, MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup>) was compared with the respective other two genotypes (wt vs. MK2<sup>−/−</sup>, wt vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup>, MK2<sup>−/−</sup> vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup>). As a result 131 (120 min LPS incubation time) or 478 (360 min LPS) of the LPS-responsive genes were at least for one condition (wt vs. MK2<sup>−/−</sup> or wt vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> or MK2<sup>−/−</sup> vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup>) significantly changed and therefore were defined as MK2- and/or MK2/3-dependently regulated. The LPS-responsive genes determined by this procedure and considered to being MK2- and/or MK2/3-dependently regulated in BMDM are listed according to their relative expression level in the Supplemental Material (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2a,b</xref>, p-values are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2c,d</xref>). The top 25 of these genes are summarized as heat maps in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref> with <italic>Ifnb1</italic> (gene symbol of IFN-β) as the factor, which is most prominently upregulated by LPS after 2 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) and <italic>Il19</italic> (IL-19) as the gene with most prominent upregulation of gene expression after 6 h of LPS treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Compared to wt BMDM the abundance of both transcripts was significantly diminished upon deletion of MK2 (wt &gt; MK2<sup>−/−</sup>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref> first column) and in the case of IL-19 transcript expression was also significantly reduced in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM (<italic>Il19</italic>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> second column, wt &gt; MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup>) as suggested by the red color in the heat maps (wt &gt; MK2<sup>−/−</sup> or wt &gt; MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup>). This indicates that in BMDM MK2 plays a critical role for the upregulation of these two genes in response to LPS. Contrariwise, when compared to MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM, additional deletion of MK3 in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM results in an upregulation of the <italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcript as indicated by the blue color (MK2<sup>−/−</sup> &lt; MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup>). Although in the analysis of the array data this upregulation was not significant, it was consistent with the RT-qPCR data outlined above (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) indicating that LPS-inducible transcript expression of the IFN-β gene is strongly diminished upon deletion of MK2 in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM, whereas, compared to MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM, IFN-β gene expression significantly increases again upon additional deletion of MK3 in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM and time dependently even exceeds that observed in wt BMDM. In addition, the expression levels of these genes compared to the wild-type control are listed in the Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2e1,f1</xref> with the wild-type control defined as 100% and those genes mentioned in the following text are also presented as bar charts (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2g–l</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">To identify genes that are differentially regulated regarding wt vs. MK2<sup>−/−</sup>, wt vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> or MK2<sup>−/−</sup> vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> a variation of the mean values between the respective genotypes of &gt;20% (wt vs. MK2<sup>−/−</sup> or wt vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> or MK2<sup>−/−</sup> vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup>: &gt;or &lt;20%) was set as a threshold. Using this threshold, the heat maps further suggested that the regulatory pattern (wt &gt; MK2<sup>−/−</sup>, MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> &gt; MK2<sup>−/−</sup>) observed for <italic>Ifnb1</italic> is not only the case for <italic>Ifnb1</italic>, but also for other genes including genes like <italic>Ccl12</italic>, <italic>Iigp1</italic>, <italic>Serpina3f</italic> and <italic>Serpina3g</italic> (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2g</xref>).

In addition, another group of genes comprising <italic>Cxcl3</italic>, <italic>Csf2</italic>, <italic>Niacr1</italic>, <italic>Slc7a1</italic> and <italic>Shisa3</italic> appears to be MK3-dependently amplified in the absence of MK2 (summarized in group IV) since the enhancement of LPS-inducible gene expression is observable in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM but does not occur upon combined deletion of MK2 and MK3 in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM (MK2<sup>−/−</sup> &gt; WT, MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> &lt; or = WT) (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2j</xref>). Furthermore, in some cases gene expression is only up- or down-regulated when both MK2 and MK3 are deleted, whereas deletion of MK2 alone appears to have no effect on gene expression. Thus, when compared to wt or MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM the expression of the genes <italic>Hdc</italic>, <italic>Il23a</italic> or <italic>Saa3</italic> (summarized in group V) is diminished upon combined deletion of MK2 and MK3 (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2k</xref>), while the genes <italic>Cd69</italic>, <italic>Cxcl9</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Marcksl1</italic>, <italic>Mx2</italic> or <italic>Socs1</italic> are upregulated in the absence of both MK2 and MK3 in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM (summarized in group VI) (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2l</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Based on these six groups defined on the basis of the distinct regulation of LPS-inducible gene expression by the protein kinases MK2 and MK3 (Figs <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2a–d</xref>) the genes identified to be MK2- and/or MK2/3-dependently regulated by LPS were allocated to one of the six defined groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Thereby, as outlined above, a gene was considered to be differentially regulated regarding wt vs. MK2<sup>−/−</sup>, wt vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> or MK2<sup>−/−</sup> vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> respectively, when the mean values between the respective genotypes varied at least 20%, which was set as a threshold (wt vs. MK2<sup>−/−</sup> or wt vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> or MK2<sup>−/−</sup> vs. MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup>: &gt;or &lt;20%). Using this approach the heatmap could be transformed into a map without any changes in the transition of color and assign a clear position for each gene within one of the six expression patterns (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3a,b</xref>). Based on this procedure, 31% of the 131 genes that were MK2- and/or MK2/3-dependently regulated after 2 h of LPS treatment, could be allocated to group II (Figs <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4a</xref>). Correspondingly, after 6 h of LPS treatment, 478 genes could be allocated to the six different expression patterns, with gene expression groups I and III as the biggest groups − 23% and 22%, respectively (Figs <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4b</xref>). Moreover, the proportion of LPS-inducible genes regulated by the interplay of MK2 and MK3 in the same way as <italic>Ifnb1</italic> increased from 9% after 2 h to 22% after 6 h of LPS treatment.</p><p id="Par12">To demonstrate the relative strength of the influence of the respective knockout phenotype compared to the other genotypes on LPS-induced expression of the respective transcripts allocated to the six different groups in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,c</xref>, we further constructed a two-dimensional scatter plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d,e</xref>). Based on these analyses, genes representative of one of the six defined groups were selected to further validate and corroborate the different regulatory patterns characterizing the six different groups. As the original aim of the study was primarily to test the hypothesis that genes other than <italic>Ifnb1</italic> are also similarly regulated by the interplay of MK2 and MK3, three genes - complement component 1 r subcomponent A (<italic>Cr1a</italic>), the inflammasome-component nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (<italic>Nod1</italic>) and the serine peptidase inhibitor clade A member 3 F (Serpina3f) - were selected to further validate the regulatory pattern characteristic of group III. As demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–c</xref>, LPS-inducible transcription of these three genes was reduced upon deletion of MK2 and, as is the case for IFN-β (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), the additional deletion of MK3 in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM resulted in at least partial reconstitution of the transcript levels compared to those in wt BMDM. Similarly, the chemokine CXCL2 (<italic>Cxcl2</italic>), the IL4 receptor (IL4R)α (<italic>Il4ra</italic>) and IL-19 (<italic>Il19</italic>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d–f</xref>) were chosen as three genes that are regulated in a similar way as IL-10 (<italic>Il10</italic>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and belong to the same group of genes (group I), which has been previously described as being either mainly MK2-dependently regulated or cooperatively regulated by MK2 and MK3. Additionally, based on the results shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> for each of the other groups (II, IV, V and VI) defined in the present study, a representative gene was chosen, and its LPS-inducible expression was analyzed in wt BMDM, MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM and MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM using RT-qPCR for further validation. Consistent with the regulatory pattern described above for the genes summarized as group II, the LPS-induced accumulation of IL-12b transcripts was enhanced in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> as well as in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM compared to that in wt BMDM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>), corroborating the assumption that the LPS-inducible expression of these genes is limited by either MK2 alone or by MK2 and MK3 in cooperation. In contrast, the transcript level of the chemokine CXCL3 (<italic>Cxcl3</italic>) was enhanced in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM but not in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM compared to that in wt BMDM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). Hence, as this gene is a member of group IV, its LPS-induced expression in BMDM lacking MK2 appears to be upregulated by MK3. In contrast, the transcript levels of genes such as HDC (<italic>Hdc</italic>) (group V) and CXCL9 (<italic>Cxcl9</italic>) (group VI) were either reduced (group V) or enhanced (group VI) in BMDM lacking both MK2 and MK3 (MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM) but not in wt BMDM or in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i,j</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>LPS-induced and MK2- and/or MK2/3-dependent expression of target genes and representatives of the 6 different types of regulation.

Hence, it was conceivable that most of the group I genes are also targets of TTP, which was another common feature of the genes in this group. To investigate whether in addition to IL-10 and CXCL2, the IL-4Rα and IL-19 genes, which are representative members of group I, are also TTP target genes, we took advantage of immortalized TTP-deficient BMDM stably transfected with a vector encoding TTP or GFP under the control of a tetracycline-dependent promoter. In these cells, TTP expression can be reconstituted upon stimulation with doxycycline, allowing analysis of putative TTP target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Notably, doxycycline-inducible TTP expression was further enhanced upon costimulation with LPS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Consistently and in agreement with previous data, LPS-inducible IL-10 expression was substantially impaired upon reconstitution of TTP expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).

In contrast, the upregulation of IL-19 transcription in response to LPS was not affected by TTP at early time points, while the decrease in the transcript abundance over time appeared to be accelerated if TTP was present (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Hence, at least at later time points, the IL-19 transcript may also belong to the group of TTP-regulated transcripts.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The mRNA binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP) controls the transcript expression of the genes summarized in group I.

This impaired activation of NFκB in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM has been demonstrated to be due to the action of MK3 in the absence of MK2. Since regular activation of NFκB is required for IFN-β gene expression, impaired NFκB activation was considered to be responsible for the reduced transcript expression observed in cells that lack MK2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">However, a more detailed analysis of the time dependency of NFκB subunit p65 appearance in nuclear extracts (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6a</xref>) and its accompanying disappearance from cytosolic lysates (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6b</xref>) in wt and MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM revealed that LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65 is not completely abolished in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM, but is diminished and delayed compared to that in wt BMDM. The additional deletion of MK3 in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM contributed greatly to restoring the wild-type conditions with respect to the time course and extension of p65 nuclear translocation (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6a,b</xref>). Notably, inhibition of p38<sup>MAPK</sup> using the small molecule compound SB203580 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) as well as deletion of MK2 (MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM) or both MK2 and MK3 (MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d,e</xref>) resulted in an increased abundance of IκBβ molecules, consistent with previous observations from our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This increased availability of IκBβ molecules is considered to be responsible for the diminished and delayed release and nuclear translocation of the NFκB p65 subunit in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> and in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM compared to the wild-type conditions. Thereby, the kinetics of the decay of IκBβ as well as the time course of the phosphorylation of IκBβ at serines 19 and 23 upon stimulation with LPS did not significantly differ between wt and MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d,f</xref>). This pattern indicates that compared to wt BMDM, MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM exhibit increased IκBβ levels while the velocity of the decay of IκBβ remains equal to wild-type conditions. Interestingly, in accordance with the observation that in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM, nuclear translocation of p65 in response to LPS treatment was almost restored to wild-type levels (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6a</xref>), the velocity of LPS-triggered IκBβ decay was substantially enhanced upon the additional deletion of MK3 in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM compared to that in wt and MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM, resulting in accelerated disappearance of IκBβ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d,f</xref>). It is therefore suggested that the restoration of the nuclear translocation of p65 to wild-type levels upon the additional deletion of MK3 in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM is due to an enhancement in the decay of IκBβ molecules in these cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d,f</xref>) that otherwise would bind p65<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and prevent its nuclear translocation. This enhancement was not accompanied by stronger or more prolonged Ser19/23 phosphorylation of IκBβ in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). In line with the increased velocity of IκBβ molecule decay, evidence is provided that compared to wild-type and MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM, MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM exhibit earlier ubiquitination of IκBβ (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6c</xref>) and that this ubiquitination can be reduced to wild-type or MK2<sup>−/−</sup> levels if MK3 is reintroduced (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6d</xref>). Hence, in the absence of MK2, MK3 is responsible for delayed IκBβ ubiquitination. Our data suggest that the LPS-induced release of NFκB from IκBβ as well as the retention of NFκB in the cytosol by binding to IκBβ is controlled by the interplay of MK2 and MK3. In this case, MK2 suppresses the enhanced accumulation of IκBβ in the cytosol, whereas MK3 delays IκBβ ubiquitination and subsequent degradation to maintain temporally controlled LPS-induced NFκB release.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>MK3 counteracts p65 NFκB nuclear translocation in the absence of MK2 by delaying the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the inhibitor of κB (IκB) β, whose protein accumulation is suppressed by MK2.

Hence, as outlined above in macrophages, MK2 upregulates the transcription of IFN-β by neutralizing the negative regulatory effects of MK3, which impedes nuclear translocation of NFκB in the absence of MK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Correspondingly, as shown previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and confirmed herein, the expression of IFN-β mRNA is lower in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM than in wild-type BMDM, an effect that at least in part can be neutralized by the additional deletion of MK3, as seen in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Notably, deletion of MK3 alone in MK3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM had no effect on the LPS-inducible expression of IFN-β, indicating that MK3 exerts its negative regulatory effects on IFN-β gene expression only in the absence of MK2 (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1b</xref>). This behavior is in contrast to the LPS-inducible expression of IL-10, which was downregulated in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> as well as in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and tended to be reduced also in MK3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1a</xref>) compared with that in wild-type BMDM. This finding supports recent observations that the regulation of IL-10 expression is governed by MK2 in cooperation with MK3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">A major aim of the present study was to clarify whether MK2 also controls the LPS-inducible expression of genes other than IFN-β by neutralizing the inhibitory effects of MK3 on gene expression. As outlined above, we defined a group of genes (group III in Figs <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>) regulated by the interplay of MK2 and MK3 in a similar way as IFN-β that, among others, includes the acute phase protein and serine peptidase inhibitor (Serpin)a3f and the pathogen recognition receptor Nod1 as well as the serine protease and component of the complement system C1rA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–c</xref>). As with the IFN-β gene (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), the LPS-inducible expression of these genes was significantly diminished in BMDM lacking MK2 compared to that in wild-type control BMDM but was reconstituted or even enhanced upon the additional deletion of MK3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–c</xref>). These data suggest that as it does for the IFN-β gene, MK3 negatively affects the expression of these genes in the absence of MK2, which neutralizes the negative regulatory effects of MK3. Of note, as it is the case for IFN-β gene expression, deletion of MK3 alone in MK3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM does not affect the LPS-inducible expression of these genes, indicating that the negative regulatory effect of MK3 only becomes apparent in the absence of MK2 (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5a–c</xref>). Contrariwise, the LPS-inducible expression of genes summarized herein as group I (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), including genes such as the chemokine CXCL2, the IL-4 receptor subunit (IL-4R)α and the cytokine IL-19 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d–f</xref>) is strongly impaired in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages, an effect, which at least in part tends to be further enhanced upon additional deletion of MK3. Consistently, the data presented herein suggest that, although not significant, the LPS-inducible expression of these genes also tends to be impaired in the absence of MK3 (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5d–f</xref>). This type of regulation corresponds to that noted in previous reports demonstrating that MK2 and MK3 cooperate in upregulating the biosynthesis of genes such as IL-10 and TNF-α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Further studies as well as the results shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> demonstrate that the transcripts of these genes are targets of the RNA-binding protein TTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that at least some of the genes in group I are also target genes of TTP.</p><p id="Par19">Notably, the data presented herein suggest that in BMDM, the regulation of gene expression by the interplay of MK2 and MK3 in response to LPS is far more complex than the two regulatory patterns summarized as group I, or <italic>Il10</italic>-type, and group III, or <italic>Ifnb1</italic>-type. Hence, at least four additional regulatory patterns were identified based on the alteration of LPS-inducible gene expression in BMDM in response to deletion of MK2 or both MK2 and MK3 (Figs <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). These patterns suggest that in addition to cooperatively upregulating gene expression or neutralizing the negative regulatory effects of MK3, MK2 may either cooperate with MK3 to limit the upregulation of gene expression in response to LPS, as demonstrated for IL-12 subunit b (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>, group II or <italic>Il12b</italic>-type), or counteract the enhancing effects of MK3, as demonstrated for CXCL3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>, group IV or <italic>Cxcl3</italic>-type). In the latter case, gene expression was strongly enhanced in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM compared with that in wild-type control cells, and this enhancement was reversed upon the additional deletion of MK3. In addition, as validated herein for the genes HDC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>) and CXCL9 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>), there are two groups - termed herein as groups V and VI (Figs <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>) - in which gene expression was either diminished (group V or <italic>Hdc</italic>-type) or enhanced (group VI or <italic>Cxcl9</italic>-type) upon deletion of both MK2 and MK3, while deletion of MK2 alone did not significantly affect gene expression in response to LPS compared to that observed in wild-type BMDM. Notably, macropinocytosis of dendritic cells (DCs) in response to LPS treatment is diminished when both kinases are missing, whereas neither MK2 nor MK3 alone exert any influence on this particular function of DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. These observations indicate that in some cases, MK2 and MK3 may thoroughly compensate for each other, whereas deletion of both causes drastic effects by unbalancing the cellular response to LPS. The underlying molecular mechanisms of the complex interplay by which the two kinases MK2 and MK3 achieve these different mechanisms of regulation of gene expression in response to LPS is largely unclear and must be the subject of future research.</p><p id="Par20">However, in this context, it is interesting to note that the negative regulatory effects of MK3 on IFN-β gene expression in the absence of MK2 are caused by delayed release of NFκB from its complex with IκBβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Consistent with this observation, compared to wild-type controls, MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM exhibited impaired LPS-inducible nuclear translocation of the NFκB complex p65 subunit (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6a</xref>), coinciding with prolonged detectability of p65 in the cytoplasm (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6b</xref>). As suggested by previous data from immortalized BMDM cell lines, this delayed activation of NFκB in MK2<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM is due to increased expression of the IκBβ protein in the absence of MK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The latter observation was confirmed herein for primary BMDM, where IκBβ expression is also increased in cells lacking MK2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d,e</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">The data presented indicate that upon additional deletion of MK3 in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM, NFκB activation is reconstituted in these cells, although the basal IκBβ levels are increased due to an accelerated decay of IκBβ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d,f</xref>). Thereby, as demonstrated herein for the first time, in the absence of MK2, MK3 delays ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκBβ. This delay is circumvented upon additional MK3 deletion in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM. Consistently, reconstitution of MK3 expression in MK2/3<sup>−/−</sup> BMDM resulted in delayed IκBβ ubiquitination, which substantiates the hypothesis that MK3 is indeed responsible for hindering the degradation of IκBβ upon MK2 deficiency (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6d</xref>). Hence, we suggest that in BMDM lacking MK2 p65 translocation is delayed due to an increased abundance of IκBβ protein in the cytoplasm and a MK3-mediated delay of their ubiquitination resulting in a prolonged degradation of IκBβ. The molecular mechanism by which MK3 interferes with the ubiquitination and degradation of IκBβ in the absence of MK2 is unclear and remains to be established. However, in this context it may be interesting to note that previous work indicates that activation of MK2 is interlinked with regulation of ubiquitination. Hence, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ube2j1 has been demonstrated to be a substrate of MK2 and MK2-dependent signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and may be involved in the regulation of proteasomal degradation of the ARE-mRNA decay factor AUF1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Preparation and cultivation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages</title><p id="Par22">The establishment, genotyping, and colony maintenance of mice deficient for MK2 or for MK3 have been described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.
