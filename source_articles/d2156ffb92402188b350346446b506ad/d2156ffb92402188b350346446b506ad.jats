We aimed to study if Swedish ESBL-producing ST131 isolates originated from single or multiple introductions to the population by assessing the amount of genetic variation, on chromosomal and plasmid level, between Swedish and international <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> ST131. Bayesian inference of Swedish <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> ST131 isolates (n = 29), sequenced using PacBio RSII, together with an international ST131 dataset showed that the Swedish isolates were part of the international ST131 A, C1 and C2 clades. Highly conserved plasmids were identified in three clusters although they were separated by several years, which indicates a strong co-evolution between some ST131 lineages and specific plasmids. In conclusion, the tight clonal relationship observed within the ST131 clades, together with highly conserved plasmids, challenges investigation of strain transmission events. A combination of few SNPs on a genome-wide scale and an epidemiological temporospatial link, are needed to track the spread of the ST131 subclones.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_46580.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Few antibiotic resistant clones have generated as much interest as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ST131. In recent years several papers have described its emergence, evolution, and molecular epidemiology globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The interest is justified since ST131 and especially its successful subclone C2/H30-Rx (hereafter referred to as C2) is the dominating multidrug-resistant (MDR) <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> lineage in many parts of the world and is overrepresented among human infections.

However, it was not until 2008, when MLST was broadly introduced, that the clone was simultaneously described in several places<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

Sweden offers a different perspective, with low antibiotic pressure and low prevalence of resistant bacteria in animals and humans, compared to other countries represented in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Given the low prevalence of ESBL-producing and low antibiotic selection pressure in Sweden, we hypothesised that ST131 isolates from Swedish carriers and patients would cluster with international clones in several different clades, if observed cases are mainly due to constant influx. This hypothesis was investigated by constructing a phylogeny of ESBL-producing ST131 isolates from i) patients with bloodstream infections and ii) non-symptomatic community carriers in Sweden in relation to previously published international ST131 isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Plasmid similarities within clusters were used to study if there were specific plasmids associated with closely related isolates, which would provide an additional level of resolution during outbreaks. Swedish ST131 isolates (n = 29) were sequenced using long-read single molecule real-time sequencing (PacBio), allowing assembly of both chromosomes and plasmids.

Our results are also in line with a previous BEAST analysis favouring the same substitution model, clock model and tree prior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

We saw slightly different values for time point clade separation (C1/C2 clade 1994 in our study versus 1986 for Zakour <italic>et al</italic>.) and mutation rate (SNP/site/year of 8.4 * 10<sup>−4</sup> in our study vs 4.39 * 10<sup>−7</sup> for Zakour <italic>et al</italic>.). These values are naturally connected since a higher mutation rate (our study) leads to more variations in a shorter time period and therefore a later divergence date. The large difference in mutation rate between the studies could be due to different methods in removing recombination, however very similar SNP alignment length after removing recombination suggests otherwise (3,297 bp in our study vs 3,779 bp for Zakour <italic>et al</italic>.). The mutation rate estimation, in our study, translates to approximately 2.7 fixated SNPs/year/genome which means that around 5 SNPs can be expected to differ between two isolates sharing a MRCA one year back in time. The number (2.7 SNPs) could be perceived as high, but importantly this is the number of SNPs in the entire genome (5 Mb), excluding recombinant SNPs and therefore an estimate to be used with caution. The estimated changes in effective population size (Skyline plot Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) show similar variations over time as previously suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

We also observed local national transmission clusters. One important aspect is that our dataset was not designed to quantify the burden of international import versus national spread of ESBL-producing ST131 in Sweden.

This was seen in both the A and C1 clade where strains clustering together was isolated at different places in Sweden and the world (UK and Australia) and therefore represent a tight clonal lineage rather than a direct transmission chain. Including more data from the international ST131 population could potentially have increased resolution within transmission cluster A and C1 which would be interesting clusters to examine in future analyses.</p><p id="Par22">In clade A the cluster containing five isolates had limited chromosomal variation and three of the isolates had very similar plasmids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These three Swedish plasmids showed high resemblance to a plasmid isolated from a patient in Germany in 2006 or 2007 (HG530657.1) that we used as reference for the plasmid SNP call (over 90% of sequence shared)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. One plasmid turned out to be almost identical to the German reference sharing 99.99% of its sequence and containing 0 SNPs (Clade A Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Considering that the Swedish isolate was from a community carrier and isolated 5–6 years after the German isolate, it shows remarkable stability. The other two plasmids in the cluster had accumulated SNPs over time (around 1,600 SNPs each) but still shared over 90% of the sequence, and the variations seen were likely not due to recombination since an even SNP accumulation was seen across the genome (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). The Swedish B1117-PB_2011 isolate had completely different plasmids that only shared the region containing the <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-15</sub> gene itself with the other plasmids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This gives insight into how unpredictable the plasmid composition of closely related strains can be. One likely explanation is that the highly mobile cassette harbouring the ISEcpI and <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-15</sub> genes has moved between plasmids. This is also a likely explanation to why we saw high presence of <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-15</sub> with chromosomal location in our Swedish dataset. Since one of the isolates in the cluster (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) was isolated in the UK, and the Swedish isolates were from very different geographical regions, this clade A clonal lineage is likely circulating internationally among community carriers but also causes clinical infections.</p><p id="Par23">The BEAST analysis showed that the C1_TC had a MRCA around 10 years back in time (Figs <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Since all isolates in this cluster, including one isolate from Australia, carried the same conserved plasmid, with only 1–3 SNPs or one recombination event, it must have been present already in the MRCA 10 years ago (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S6</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

The conserved plasmid together with the limited chromosomal SNP differences (around 30–40 SNPs) in the C1_TC cluster indicate a strong co-evolution between the plasmid lineage carrying <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-27</sub> and the specific C1 ST131 clade as has been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

It is evident that the Swedish ST131 population is part of the international lineages and that several introductions combined with national transmission have formed the strain population. The clonal nature of the ST131 lineage, with highly conserved plasmids in some sub-lineages, complicates estimation of local circulation and transmission, and highlights the importance of temporospatial epidemiological links even in the genomic era. However, very close genetic relationships (a few chromosomal SNPs) could indicate a direct transmission even if the epidemiological link is unknown. Such small differences can only be detected by whole genome sequencing and not with traditional typing methods. Online tools and databases to analyse WGS data adapted for clinical microbiologists and public health workers could provide the possibility to detect outbreaks with clonal linages like ST131, two examples are BacWGSTdb and Enterobase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The presence of plasmids, which were highly conserved over many years, in a widely disseminated clonal lineage illustrates that identical plasmids sequences are not a certain evidence of plasmid transmission. If a suspected plasmid transmission takes place in a hospital and identical plasmids are identified it still might not be a direct spread if the plasmid originates from one of these conserved lineages. Therefore, despite the emergence of sequencing technology that allows for rapid plasmid sequencing in the clinical settting, more work is still to understand the role of conserved plasmids in certain conserved clonal lineages, and how this phenomenon can impact inference about plasmid transmission events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Swedish clinical isolates</title><p id="Par26">A total of 29 strains of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> ST131 isolates from patients with bloodstream infections (n = 20) and from non-symptomatic community carriers (n = 9) were selected from a larger dataset of ST131 (n = 177) from bloodstream infections and community carriers.
