This research aims to assess the environmental impacts of effluent waters, treated by Kermanshah wastewater treatment plant (KWTP), on some physicochemical variables of the adjacent river named as Qarasou River, northwestern Iran. Several water samples were collected from different locations into KWTP and along the Qarasou River in different time intervals of April and July 2017 to assess the effect of treated waters on the environment water quality. As well, an integrated environmental change index (<italic>ΔY</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) was defined to assess the degree of changes and impacts in the current status.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The analyses indicated that the values of total suspended solids (TSS), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>), phosphorous (P), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) overall decreased by treatment process at effluent water compared with raw sewage amounts. Contrarily, amounts of acidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) slightly increased in effluent water due to the aeration processes during the treatment process. The environmental change index (<italic>ΔY</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) was estimated between 0.04 and 0.88 with an average of 0.28 for all variables in different time intervals, indicating the lowest degree of environmental changes and higher efficiency of treating wastewater in KWTP.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The results concluded the efficiency for the removal TSS, NO<sub>3</sub>, BOD, and COD is estimated 80–92% during the water purification process in KWTP as an acceptable efficiency.

Reuse of treated wastewater constitutes a perfect alternative in many cases such as surface water and groundwater recharge. Consideration of treated wastewater, as a valuable source of recycling water for various consumptions, is one of the most important goals of establishing wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) especially in arid regions (Tchobanoglus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>; Tyagi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">Nowadays, the wastewater treatment plant gives rise to an environmental impact due to its energy reserve, chemical compounds, and emissions to the atmosphere and sludge production (Hospido et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>). For instance, discharging of the mentioned large volume of effluents waters to receiving sources and the surrounding environment has been produced a destructive environmental impact (Kobya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Several approaches are considered to assess surface water quality. In the conventional environmental assessment, the legislators consider the pollution in the outlet of all pollutant sources using fieldwork operations. However, using environment-based standards, some qualitative measurement is carried out at a specific point in the aquatic environment (Boyd and Greenwood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>). The measurements of urban sewage are depended on water quality modeling of chemical, physical, and biological properties (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). Hence, responsible organizations for the environment and health worldwide have developed guidance and standards for this purpose.</p><p id="Par16">Purification and treatment of urban wastewater is an essential part of water resource management because it is possible to recycle treated water for increasing human consumption. Discharge of urban wastewater containing harmful chemicals to the environment is considered as a main environmental problem issue in developing countries such as Iran. In recent decades, the increasing growth of urbanization of Iran has led to entry the high amounts of sewage into the aquatic environment.</p><p id="Par17">The pollution of water resources by wastewater discharge is categorized as a severe threat to human societies and the natural environment (APHA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1992</xref>). For instance, Essien (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>) has investigated the sewage pollution load of nitrates in a river in Nigeria. Deng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>) have studied the total pollution load of phosphates and COD in a river in China. Accordingly, the selection of the proper purification methods is depended on the main pollution loads and sensitivity of the environmental resources in each region.</p><p id="Par18">This research aims to study the environmental effects of Kermanshah wastewater treatment plant (KWTP) on the adjacent river named as Qarasou River. In previous papers, researchers have studied the treatment process of some treatment plants of Kermanshah province in order to determine parasite presence in raw sewage (e.g., Sharafi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">b</xref>, Almasi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>, Dindarlou and Dastourani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>). Sharafi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">b</xref>) have estimated the measurement of the presence of the biological parasite in treated and raw sewage of KWTP, encouraging its proper disinfection method. Almasi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>) have investigated the economic cost and efficiency of KWTP, indicating the economic efficiency of its treatment process. Furthermore, Dindarlou and Dastourani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>) have reported the proper effectiveness of KWTP’s treated water for reuse in agricultural irrigation.</p><p id="Par19">Despite literature as mentioned above, the direct/indirect effects of KWTP on natural water resource have not been considered to more assessment. Hence, the main novelty of this study is depended on a general attitude to assess the spatial/temporal variations of KWTP’s treated/untreated wastewater on the adjacent river. For this purpose, several water samples are collected from different locations into KWTP and along the Qarasou River in different time intervals of April and July 2017 to investigate the effluent effect of the treatment plant on water quality.

In this regard, nine physiochemical variables are considered including total suspended solids (TSS), water temperature, alkalinity, acidity (pH), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>), phosphorus (P), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and dissolved oxygen (DO).

According to this process, urban sewage is collected using pipelines into the plant. Then, several stages are carried out on collected sewage in order to produce treated water by 0.5 million m<sup>3</sup>/day. After transferring the sewage to the treatment center, the screening stage starts to remove solid wastes using drum filters. In the next stage, the wastewater is conducted to aeration basins in order to start an aero-biologic process of sludge removal. Into filtration stage, the sewage is compressed using membrane micro-filters to remove solid sludge. In sedimentation basins, precipitated biochemical liquid sludge is eliminated from treated water. Finally after simple disinfection, the treated water effluents arrive at Qarasou River using an auxiliary channel.

Urban sewage usually has massive amounts of suspended solids, which are mostly organic incompatible fluids, such as oils and greases, are considered as sewage ingredients. Industrial water consumption may lead to organic or mineral impurities introduction into water. Suspended solids prepare chemical and biological substances adsorption. Biologically, suspended solids are included pathogenic microorganisms, such as organisms that are toxin producer in algae chains. The amount of all solids suspended or dissolved in water (organic or inorganic) are measured to obtain TSS. This measurement is determined by the evaporating the sample to the dry phase and measuring the residual mass. The total amount of the remaining mass is expressed in mg/l. A drying temperature, slightly higher than the boiling point (104 °C), is adequate to remove liquid as well as absorbed water at the solid particle surface. Most solid suspended solids can be separated from water by filtration so the suspended solids in a water sample can be estimated by water filtering, drying the remaining mass, and filtering to a constant weight at a temperature of 104 °C and determining the remaining mass on the filter.</p><p id="Par31">After drying and measuring the samples, the amount of organic matter of suspended solids and total solids can be obtained by igniting the residual masses at 600 °C in 1 h. The organic part of the residual mass will be converted into carbon dioxide, vapor, and other gases, released to the environment. When the organic matter of suspended solids is measured, it is necessary to use a filter, made of fiberglass or some other resistant material, which does not decompose against high temperatures. The suspended solid variable is used to measure the quality of purification processes and the effluent flow. The Environmental Protection Organization of Iran (EPO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>) has set a threshold for most of the suspended solids as 40 mg/l in treated waters. The results of this variable measurement are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a. On this basis, the TSS value has been overall decreased by treatment process at effluent water (20–25 mg/l) compared with raw sewage amounts (110–140 mg/l). In April time interval, the variable values are estimated lesser than July due to dryness and evaporate effects increase TSS values in July into both raw sewage and treatment process.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Physicochemical variables based on spatial and temporal sampling</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>No.</p></th><th align="left"><p>Variable</p></th><th align="left"><p>Time</p></th><th align="left"><p>Raw sewage</p></th><th align="left"><p>Aeration basin</p></th><th align="left"><p>Effluent water</p></th><th align="left"><p>Upstream</p></th><th align="left"><p>Downstream</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>1</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>TSS (mg/l)</p></td><td align="left"><p>April</p></td><td align="left"><p>110</p></td><td align="left"><p>15</p></td><td align="left"><p>20</p></td><td align="left"><p>10</p></td><td align="left"><p>20</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>July</p></td><td align="left"><p>140</p></td><td align="left"><p>100</p></td><td align="left"><p>25</p></td><td align="left"><p>100</p></td><td align="left"><p>30</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>2</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Temp.

Furthermore, there is a significant relationship between temperature and gases solubility in water. The water temperature depends on many factors, such as atmospheric temperature. Shallow water reserves are more affected by atmospheric temperature than deeper water reserves. Cold waters usually have a wider variety of biological species. At lower temperature, bioactivity is at the lower rate.</p><p id="Par34">For bacterial activity, the optimum temperature is in the range of 25 to 35 °C (Metcalf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>). The abundance of algae is commonly found in warm waters. Larger species of living organisms in water, such as fishes, are controlled by the temperature and the amount of oxygen dissolved in water. Changes in temperature affect the speed of chemical reactions and chemicals solubility. Most chemical reactions, such as the solution of solids, are faster due to increased temperatures.</p><p id="Par35">On the other hand, gas solubility is reduced in the higher temperature, because the biological oxidation of organic substances in water depends on the high amount of dissolved oxygen. Measuring the water temperature of samples revealed similar values for treated and natural water temperature at different times (22–23 °C on July and 17–18 °C on Apr). Hence, the KWTP has not any change in this variable (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Water alkalinity</title><p id="Par36">Alkalinity is a criterion for water ability to neutralize acids. The components of alkalinity in geological systems include HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>, OH<sup>−</sup>, HSiO<sup>3−</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>BO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, HS<sup>−</sup>, NH<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. These components are obtained from minerals decomposition in the soil or atmosphere. The microbial decomposition of organic matter can produce hydrogen sulfide and ammonia. The most popular elements of alkalinity are bicarbonate, carbonate, and hydroxide. In addition to the mineral origin, these materials can be obtained from carbon dioxide and microbial decomposition of organic matter. Overwhelming algae depends on the pH values of 9–10. High alkalinity gives a bitter taste. The fundamental concern about the water’s alkalinity is the reactions that can occur between specific alkalinity and certain cations.</p><p id="Par37">The critical amounts of alkalinity for drinking water or sewage by the EPO have not yet been determined. The water’s alkalinity is mostly due to bicarbonate and carbonate ions presence (usually associated with ions K, Na, Mg, Ca) and hydroxides in water. The alkalinity is often measured based on the amount of carbonate and bicarbonate in terms of calcium carbonate. The alkalinity of water can be due to the relationship between carbon dioxide alkalinity and pH below the neutral point (pH = 7). At pH 4.6–8.3, water alkalinity is in the form of the balance between bicarbonate and carbon dioxide. When the pH value is higher than 8.3, free carbon dioxide is terminated, and alkalinity occurs as carbonate and bicarbonate, while pH 9.4–10 is due to the presence of hydroxide in water. When alkalinity is due to carbonate, it also forms a temporary harshness. The alkalinity is one of the factors controlling the processes of sewage treatment. As illustrated data in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, the alkalinity in treated effluent water has been reduced due to the addition of some acids to wastewater in the treatment process.

Two electrical and colorimetric methods can measure the pH. In the electrical method, the hydrogen electrode is used. It is difficult to use the hydrogen electrode, especially if the solution has substances that are absorbed on the platinum electrode. Nowadays, instead of the hydrogen electrode, the glass electrode is used. This electrode measures the potential created by hydrogen ions without interfering with other ions. The colorimetric method, detectors are used. The hydrogen electrode calibrates the detectors to find their specific color at different pH. Therefore, pH above 7, alkaline water, and pH are one of the most important physicochemical properties of water, since they depend more on pH than water treatment methods. In neutral water, the H<sup>+</sup> concentration is equal to the OH<sup>−</sup> one. Natural water pH is 4–9 and because that the underground layer has alkaline state water becomes alkaline.</p><p id="Par39">Temporal changes in samples acidity at different locations show that the processes of neutralizing wastewater acidity affect the process of slight changes in the pH reduction in the aeration stage and effluent water compared to the raw sewage (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). In the rainy time of April month, a slight decrease in pH is observed due to the precipitation effect. According to the environmental standard of EPO, the pH level in the effluent water to surface water should be ranged between 6.5 and 8.6.

Measurement of nitrate by spectrophotometer (UV) is used to measure nitrate of samples containing low amounts of organic matter, non-contaminated water samples, and drinking fresh water sources. Measuring the UV absorbance at 220 nm is possible to find the amount of nitrate quickly, because dissolved organic matter may be absorbed in wavelengths of 275 and 220 nm, and nitrate is only absorbed in 220 nm. Therefore, simultaneous measurement of sample absorption at 275 nm can help the nitrate absorption in the sample and organic matter removal.</p><p id="Par41">The results of measuring the nitrate content of samples showed that the amount of nitrate within the treatment process is decreased (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). In April month, nitrate values into both raw sewage and effluent water are registered similar to 10 mg/l. In July month, nitrate values in the raw sewage and the effluent water to the river have been registered as 200 and 20 mg/l, respectively indicating acceptable result compared to a threshold of environmental standards (&lt; 50 mg/l).

Different forms of phosphate are produced from a variety of sources. Conventionally, some polyphosphates is added to the process of wastewater purification. Then, phosphates are widely used in boiler water treatment. The orthophosphates called as agricultural fertilizers can be introduced into surface waters when floods or snow melting erodes the soil.

According to the environmental standard of EPO, the phosphorus level in the effluent water to surface water should be ranged below than 6 mg/l.

The oxidation reactions that occur in the BOD test are the result of bacterial activity, temperature, and pH. Usually, the BOD test is carried out at 20 °C. Within 20 days, approximately 95 to 99% of the organic matter can be oxidized in a treatment process. Besides, a large percentage of organic matter (about 70%) are decomposed in the first 5 days, which is called as BOD<sub>5</sub>.

Comparison of changes in this variable in the wet time (April) and dry time (July) showed that the amount of the COD in dried climate is higher than the humid climate.

The environmental change index (<italic>ΔY</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) indicated that the lowest degree of environmental changes in the current status and higher efficiency of treating wastewater in KWTP belongs to TSS variable (0.04–0.08). Measuring the temperature of water samples revealed similar values for treated and natural water temperature at different times (22–23 °C on July and 17–18 °C on Apr). Hence, the KWTP has not any effect on the changes of this variable. The alkalinity has been overall decreased by treatment process at effluent water (300–350 mg/l) compared with raw sewage amounts (380–390 mg/l) due to the addition of some acids during the purification process. The variable of pH has been slightly reduced in the aeration stage and effluent water compared to the raw sewage.</p><p id="Par52">Nitrate values in the raw sewage and the effluent water to the river have been registered as 200 and 20 mg/l, respectively. The environmental change index (<italic>ΔY</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) indicated that the maximized degree of environmental changes in current status belongs to nitrate variable (0.45–0.88). Changes in phosphorus content showed that the value had been overall decreased by treatment process at effluent water (2.3–2.4 mg/l) compared with raw sewage amounts (3.8–3.9 mg/l). The BOD values have been overall decreased by treatment process at effluent water (15 mg/l) compared with raw sewage amounts (125–200 mg/l). Besides, measuring the amount of the COD revealed that the value had been overall decreased by treatment process at effluent water (40–80 mg/l) compared with raw sewage amounts (390–400 mg/l). DO content of the samples showed an increased value due to the aeration processes applied in the treatment plant during the stages from aeration basins to effluent water and downstream points. Meanwhile, the stream water’s self-cleaning capacity may contribute to the increasing DO values in downstream (Odjadjare and Okoh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par53">Several indicators, such as BOD and COD removal efficiencies are used to comparatively analyze a variety of wastewater treatment systems (Colmenarejo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>). Cumulative BOD and COD efficiency indices that help the determination of the overall efficiency have the main role in average nutrient integrated efficiency (NIE) of the treated effluent water (Mahapatra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>). Hence, the overall efficiency of treatment plants can be measured based on the chemical parameters of BOD and COD (Carducci and Verani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). Overall, the removal efficiency for the BOD and COD was estimated at 80–92% during the water treating in KWTP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par54">The issue of sewage contamination and its effects on environmental tissues is the main part of water resource studies. In this study, to investigate the environmental impacts of Kermanshah wastewater treatment plant (KWTP) on some physicochemical variables of effluent treated waters into Qarasou River, several water samples were collected from different locations into KWTP and along the Qarasou River in different time intervals of April and July 2017.</p><p id="Par55">The results showed that except COD and DO variables; the values of other obtained variables are in standard ranges of the Environmental Protection Organization of Iran for the effluent treated water to streams and surface water. Therefore, the removal efficiency for the TSS, NO<sub>3</sub>, BOD, and COD is estimated by 80–92% during the water purification process in KWTP. Based on previous analysis carried out on the raw and treated sewage in KWTP in 2012, biologic pollutants, parasites, and heavy metal comparisons have not been observed, and the efficiency of purification process has been obtained as 80% (KWWA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). Therefore, a survey on KWTP in 2013 estimated the efficiency of the purification process approximately 80% (Almasi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). The results of the present study revealed the similar and progressed status of water efficiency of purification. Hence, it can be mentioned that the activated sludge process of KWTP has not any risky impact on Qarasou River and the whole environment. Similarly, in previous studies focusing on KWTP, several researches have reported the proper disinfection method in removal biologic parasites (Sharafi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">b</xref>) the proper effect of the treatment process for removal pollution nearby to 81% (Almasi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>) and the quality of treated water for reuse in agricultural irrigation (Dindarlou and Dastourani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">Application of this result can play an essential role in designing and optimally implementing the next units of the treatment plant in the future. There are some suggestions to enhance the treatment process. First, to overcome the high amounts of dissolved oxygen in the treatment process, establishing of a boiling tank is suggested before the final effluent stage. Second, it seems that the KWTP process in dry months needs more time to recycle the sewage in aeration and sedimentation basins in order to the effective decrease of COD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>We thank anonymous reviewers for technical suggestions on data interpretations.</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Informed consent</title><p id="Par57">Informed consent was obtained from individual participant included in the study.</p></sec></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>All authors were equally involved in analyzing and editing the paper.
