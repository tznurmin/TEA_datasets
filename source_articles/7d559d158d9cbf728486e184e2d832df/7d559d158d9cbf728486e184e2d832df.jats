Identification of host factors that support viral replication is important to understand mechanisms of viral replication and to develop new therapeutic strategies. We identified TARDBP as a host factor that regulates HBV. Silencing or knocking out the protein in HBV infected cells severely impaired the production of viral replicative intermediates, mRNAs, proteins, and virions, whereas ectopic expression of TARDBP rescued production of these products. Mechanistically, we found that the protein binds to the HBV core promoter, as shown by chromatin precipitation as well as mutagenesis and protein-DNA interaction assays. Using LC-MS/MS analysis, we also found that TARDBP binds to a number of other proteins known to support the HBV life cycle, including NPM1, PARP1, Hsp90, HNRNPC, SFPQ, PTBP1, HNRNPK, and PUF60. Interestingly, given its key role as a regulator of RNA splicing, we found that TARDBP has an inhibitory role on pregenomic RNA splicing, which might help the virus to export its non-canonical RNAs from the nucleus without being subjected to unwanted splicing, even though mRNA nuclear export is normally closely tied to RNA splicing. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TARDBP is involved in multiple steps of HBV replication via binding to both HBV DNA and RNA. The protein’s broad interactome suggests that TARDBP may function as part of a RNA-binding scaffold involved in HBV replication and that the interaction between these proteins might be a target for development of anti-HBV drugs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">JP17fk0310109&amp;amp;#xFF48;0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chayama</surname><given-names>Kazuaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>29</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_44934.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="CrossLinking"><sec><p>A correction to this article is available online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-58888-6" ext-link-type="url">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-58888-6</ext-link>.</p></sec></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Worldwide, it is estimated that more than 200 million people are chronic carriers of HBV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, with infection resulting in about one million deaths per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Control of HBV replication is a key strategy to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic HBV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying viral replication remain elusive. Currently, interferon and nucleo(t)side analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NAs) are used to suppress HBV replication, but problems with adverse effects and the risk of drug resistance remain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, identifying cellular host factors that are required to support the HBV life cycle will be a major step forward in the process of developing new anti-HBV drugs.</p><p id="Par3">The hepatitis B viral genome is present in infectious particles in the form of 3.2 kb partially double -stranded, relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA). Following infection, the virus gains entry into hepatocytes via its receptor, the human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The viral genome is uncoated in the cytoplasm, then transported to the nucleus where the rcDNA is converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). The cccDNA serves as the template for synthesis of genomic and subgenomic viral transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Replication of the virus occurs by reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Four viral promoters, Core, Pre S1, Pre S2, and X, and two enhancers, enhancer I and enhancer II, control the transcription of HBV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In addition, a vast number of host cellular transcription factors, including nuclear receptors, regulate HBV transcription by acting on the HBV promoters and enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">To further understand the molecular mechanisms behind the control of HBV replication and pathogenesis, we identified novel host factors that could play a role in the viral lifecycle using primary human hepatocytes derived from human hepatocyte transplanted chimeric mice, an infection system that we recently established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. One of the candidates we identified was a gene that codes for the trans-active response DNA binding protein (TARDBP). The protein was initially identified by Ignatius <italic>et al</italic>. as a factor that binds to TAR DNA of HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. TARDBP belongs to the family of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) that serve multiple roles in the generation and processing of RNA, including transcription, splicing, transport, and mRNA stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. TARDBP contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), through which it binds to UG/TG repeats in RNA/DNA, respectively, and a C-terminal glycine-rich domain that is considered important for protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In disease, TARDBP is known to be frequently mutated in sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), providing evidence of a direct link between TARDBP abnormalities and neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The role of this protein in HBV pathogenesis remains unreported.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we demonstrate that TARDBP is a novel host factor that can enhance HBV gene expression via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. We show that silencing of the protein results in inhibition of HBV gene expression. We further provide evidence that TARDBP activates transcription from the core promoter of HBV and that TARDBP forms complexes with other proteins known to support the lifecycle of HBV. Moreover, we report that the protein has an inhibitory effect on splicing of pregenomic (pg) HBV RNA, which may help the virus export noncanonical unspliced RNAs from the nucleus despite the normally close association between splicing and nuclear export.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Silencing of TARDBP inhibits HBV infection and gene expression in cell cultures</title><p id="Par6">To examine whether TARDBP plays a role in HBV gene expression, we performed gene silencing assays using the human hepatocyte cell line HepG2 with stably expressed NTCP (HepG2-hNTCP) as the HBV infection model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The cells were transduced with lentiviruses containing shRNA targeting TARDBP or scramble control shRNA and selected in puromycin. Reduction in TARDBP expression was confirmed by western blotting and qPCR to be &gt;70% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The effect of TARDBP silencing on HBV replication was examined by HBV infection of the cells for 12 days. Downregulation of TARDBP resulted in decreased levels of HBV secreted virions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Concordantly, knockdown of TARDBP also inhibited secretion of HBs and HBe proteins in the supernatant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), production of the core protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), as demonstrated by CLEIA and western blotting, respectively, and production of HBV replicative intermediates as shown by both real-time PCR and Southern blotting (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). In addition, the 3.5-kb mRNA, which consists of precore and pregenomic (pg) mRNAs together with total HBV mRNAs were also remarkably reduced in TARDBP depleted cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). To further elucidate the role of TARDBP in HBV replication, we used T23 cells, a HepG2 cell line that is stably transfected with the 1.4x genome-length HBV expressing plasmid pTRE-HB-wt, and thus can constitutively produce HBV DNA in the supernatant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Consistent with the results of the HBV infection model, gene silencing of TARDBP significantly inhibited expression of the core protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), extracellular DNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), intracellular DNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) and HBV mRNAs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) in these cells.

To study its role in HBV, we first investigated the localization of the protein in the stably transduced HBV cell line T23. As shown by immunofluorescence, TARDBP is primarily localized in the nucleus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), hence its functions are expected to be restricted to the nucleus in our experimental setting. TARDBP was originally identified as a transcription factor that could repress the transcription of HIV-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>; moreover, the protein has been shown to bind to DNA sequences in the promoter regions of a number of genes and regulate their expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that it could interact with one or more of the HBV promoters in order to regulate HBV replication. To this end, chromatin was prepared from the T23 cells and subjected to quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using a TARDBP antibody. The precipitated DNA was then subjected to real-time qPCR using primers specific for each of the four HBV promoters (Core, Sp1, Sp2 and X). PCR analysis showed that a DNA sequence corresponding to the core promoter was enriched in the TARDBP-antibody precipitate compared to the control, whereas the amount of the other three promoters was unchanged (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The existence of a band corresponding to enriched TARDBP protein and the core promoter in the anti-TARDBP precipitate was validated by western blotting and PCR, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). This finding implied that TARDBP could regulate HBV transcription by interacting with the core promoter. To further characterize the relevance of the TARDBP-core promoter interaction, we employed a luciferase reporter assay. The pGL3-Cp plasmid is a luciferase plasmid whose expression is driven from the core promoter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The pGL3-Cp was co-transfected with an empty vector or with increasing concentrations of a TARDBP expressing plasmid in NTCP-HepG2 cells. The transcriptional activity was examined in these cells. As shown, we observed a dose dependent enhancement of core promoter activity by TARDBP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). At this point, we asked ourselves whether TARDBP could also bind to HBV cccDNA. Results from a ChIP assay demonstrated that TARDBP could not precipitate cccDNA, as opposed to HBV core protein, which has already been reported to bind to cccDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>), implying that TARDBP binds to cccDNA during active transcription and is therefore easily nicked and degraded during the extraction process. Taken together, these findings suggest that TARDBP interacts with the core promoter, resulting in a positive regulatory effect.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TARDBP activates the HBV core promoter.

We confirmed that KO of TARDBP did not affect the expression levels of NTCP, the protein responsible for HBV infection in this cell line, nor another known HBV transcription factor, SIRT1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). At first, we examined the core promoter transcriptional activity in the KO cells versus the parental cells. The pGL3-Cp plasmid was transfected in equal amounts to the cells, and luciferase activity was determined 48 hours after transfection. Core promoter transcriptional activity was compromised in KO cells in comparison to the parental NTCP-HepG2 cells, but interestingly, the transcriptional activity was rescued upon ectopic expression of TARDBP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c,d</xref>). This observation implied that failure of the cells to activate the core promoter was due to the absence of TARDBP. We next evaluated HBV infection and replicative ability in the KO cells relative to the parental cells. The cells were infected with the HBV virus as in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, and HBV-secreted virions and proteins were measured at the end of the infection period. Consistently, HBV gene expression was drastically reduced in the TARDBP KO cells in relation to cells expressing the protein but was partially rescued by the exogenous protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e–g</xref>). Although complementation with ectopic TARDBP exhibited total rescue of the core promoter activity in KO cells, HBV gene expression after HBV infection was only partially rescued. This could be due to the challenge in re-expressing the protein in KO cells for the entire infection period. Whereas the luciferase transcriptional assays were performed 48 hours after transfection when protein expression was still intact, the longer period of time required for HBV infection may have compromised the expression of the transiently transfected plasmid. Indeed, a time series assessment confirmed that the protein was only detected until 72 hours after transfection, beyond which the expression slowly became undetectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2B</xref>). Our attempts to establish stably-transfected TARDBP KO cells also failed. The reason for this was not clear, but TARDBP is known to control its own homoeostasis in human cells, as ectopic expression of the protein promoted instability of both the endogenous and ectopic mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, other members of the hnRNP family have been shown to possess these auto-regulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This could explain our difficulties in expressing the protein. However, it is still interesting to note that the initial presence of the protein alone was responsible for a significant restoration of the HBV gene expression in KO cells.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Establishment of TARDBP-knockout (KO) cells by a CRISPR/Cas9 system.

As noted earlier, TARDBP has two RNA Recognition Motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) through which it is able to bind to DNA and RNA targets. It is believed that both RRMs play a role in the nucleic acid binding by the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In addition, the protein has a glycine rich C-terminal region through which it interacts with other proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We therefore reasoned that TARDBP could either directly bind to the DNA sequences in the core promoter region or it could indirectly activate the core promoter through interaction with transcription factors that are known to bind and activate the core promoter. If TARDBP binds to the core promoter directly, then disruption of the RRMs could inhibit its transcriptional activity. To this end, we employed three TARDBP mutants in which either or both RRMs were deleted (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Expression of these proteins in NTCP-HepG2 cells was confirmed by western blotting using the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), as they all contain the FLAG tag at the N-terminus. As a next step, we used the luciferase reporter assay to compare core promoter transcriptional activation by the three RRM mutant proteins versus the wild type protein. The ability of TARDBP to activate transcription from the core promoter was partially disrupted by deletion of RRM1 but was totally abolished by deletion of RRM2 or both RRMs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that each of the proteins maintained nuclear localization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>), indicating that interference with the transcriptional effect was not due to nuclear translocation. To further confirm the significance of the two RRMs in HBV DNA binding, we used the TARDBP ΔRRM1, 2 mutant, in which both nucleic acid binding domains were deleted for the ChIP assay. We confirmed that deletion of the two RRMs abolished the ability of the protein to interact with the core promoter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Taken together, our results imply that the RRM2 plays a dominant role, with RRM1 having a supportive role in the protein’s transcriptional effect. Moreover, deletion of both RRMs totally abrogates the interacting ability of the protein and subsequent transcriptional effect, which confirms that the DNA binding ability of the protein is necessary for it to activate the core promoter.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of TARDBP are crucial for activation of the core promoter.

The minimum sequence necessary for DNA binding by TARDBP remains unknown. Since the core promoter spans the region nt1613-nt1849 of the HBV viral genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, we randomly selected an approximately 46 bp target length to create 6 overlapping DNA probes from the entire 237 bp region for the EMSA experiment. Because TARDBP has been shown to sometimes bind to the antisense sequence but not the corresponding sense sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, we also included the antisense probes for each of the 6 probes to make a total of 12 probes. The probes were labeled as sense (S) probes 1–6 and anti-sense (AS) probes 1–6 in a consecutive manner starting from the C-terminus (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). To screen for sequences among these probes to which TARDBP could bind, EMSA was performed using a GST-purified TARDBP recombinant protein that was successfully detected by anti-GST and anti-TARDBP antibodies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). In the EMSA experiment, two shifted bands, indicating a possible DNA-protein interaction, were observed for 2 of the 12 probes, namely S probe 3 and AS probe 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4A</xref>, lanes 4 and 8). However, further experimentation indicated that binding to the S probe 3 was only dependent on the formation of a secondary structure whose intensity was reduced in the presence of the protein, suggesting that the protein bound to the secondary structure and not the intact probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4A</xref>, lane 15 and Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4B</xref> lane 5). Henceforth, we decided to focus on the AS probe 1 that indicated direct protein binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4B</xref>, lane 2). The probe was the antisense strand of nt1804-nt1849 whose sequence is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>. Indeed we confirmed binding of TARDBP to the probe, as the intensity of the shifted band increased in proportion to the dose of the protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, lanes 1–5). A similar pattern was observed when the probe was incubated with decreasing concentrations of a specific competitor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, lanes 7–12). To rule out the possibility of non-specific binding, we tested binding of TARDBP to the adjacent AS probe of nt1765-nt1810 whose sequence is also shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>. The protein failed to bind to the probe from the adjacent sequence, showing that the interaction was specific (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, lane 6). To further confirm binding of TARDBP to the 46 bp element, the EMSA reaction was performed in the presence of a TARDBP antibody. Indeed the antibody did cause a supershift (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>, lane 3). However, we noticed that two super-shifted bands were present. We reasoned that this could be due to the presence of homodimers, as TARDBP molecules are known to fold and homodimerize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To resolve this point, we immunoprecipitated a FLAG-TARDBP cell lysate using an anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-TARDBP antibody, as exogenous tagged-TARDBP is known to appear at a slightly higher molecular weight than the endogenous one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Indeed we observed two bands, one corresponding to the exogenous (FLAG-tagged) protein and the other to the endogenous protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>) confirming self-interaction of TARDBP molecules.

The wild-type probe interacted with TARDBP as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4D</xref>, lane 2); however, under the same conditions, none of the four fragments could interact with the TARDBP protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4D</xref>, lanes 4, 6, 8 and 10). As a next step, we used mutational analysis to scan the sequence for possible target regions based on previous reports. TARDBP has been shown to bind preferentially to DNA enriched for TT, TG or GT nucleotide pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. We identified these sequences at several locations within the probe. To study their significance, we generated a series of five mutant probes (mutant 1–5) where individual nucleotides were substituted, focusing specifically on locations with TT, TG or GT pairs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The mutants were subjected to an EMSA assay alongside the wild type probe.

However mutations of T or G nucleotides abolished the binding of the protein to the probe (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>, lanes 3, 4, 6 and 7). Consistent with previous reports, TG and GT nucleotide pairs seem to play a central role in TARDBP binding to the core promoter. In addition, the results also show that TARDBP has two separate binding sites on the probe, as mutations in either the N-terminal or the C-terminal sequences abolished the interaction.

We therefore wondered whether HBV may take advantage of this in addition to the nuclear localization of the protein to assemble protein complexes that favor viral replication. We first screened for proteins that interact with TARDBP in a HBV replicating cell line using LC-MS/MS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>) and identified 491 potential interaction partners (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). Coverage ranged from 0.17 to 63.86 with a median of 8.45. The peak list included 25 transcription factors, 17 oncogenes, 3 protein kinases, and 3 cell differentiation markers. Gene set enrichment analysis of canonical pathways indicated significant enrichment of splicing, poly(A) RNA binding, and RNA processing pathways. To identify any proteins that could play a part in the HBV lifecycle, we selected the top proteins with coverage 10 or above and searched the literature using these proteins and HBV as search terms. Following this approach, 8 proteins were identified, namely PTBP1, PUF60, SFPQ, Hsp90, PARP1, HNRNPK, NPM1, and HNRNPC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>), which have been reported to play various roles in transcription and post-transcriptional and nucleocapsid assembly stages of the virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

We therefore investigated whether TARDBP could play a role in HBV mRNA splicing. HBV undergoes reverse transcription during its replication and only utilizes unspliced mRNA for viral gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In addition to the unspliced mRNAs, a series of spliced (SP) HBV RNAs have been widely described in model systems and in HBV-infected livers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The most frequently detected variant is a 2.2 kb molecule termed SP1, which is generated through the removal of a 1.3 kb intron from the pgRNA at nt2447 and nt489<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. To determine any role for TARDBP in HBV pgRNA splicing, we measured the ratio of SP1 to the WT pgRNA in HBV producing cells with or without silencing of TARDBP. We employed two sets of primers to recognize intron-internal sequences to detect the WT product and those across the exons to detect the SP form (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Specificity of the primers was confirmed, as SP primers did not amplify the WT product (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). As shown, diminishing TARDBP in the cells resulted in 100% increase in splicing of pgRNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>), which implies that TARDBP serves as an inhibitor of splicing, thereby enhancing the export of unspliced pgRNA into the cytoplasm. As a next step, we tested whether TARDBP could bind to HBV RNA. To this end, total lysates were obtained from HBV-producing cells that were over-expressing FLAG-tagged TARDBP. They were then subjected to an RNA immunoprecipitation assay using TARDBP antibody as the bait. The precipitated mRNAs were purified and subjected to qPCR analysis to detect HBV mRNA. TARDBP and APOA2 mRNAs served as positive controls since they are already known to bind to TARDBP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. GAPDH mRNA was detected as a negative control to exclude non-specific interactions. As expected, TARDBP and APOA2 mRNAs were enriched on the TARDBP antibody (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). In addition, total HBV mRNA was also shown to be enriched on the TARDBP precipitate, indicating that the mRNA was precipitated by the protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). As a next step, we attempted to identify potential TARDBP HBV RNA binding sites by examining the HBV genome for conserved TG-repeats. We downloaded aligned genome sequences from HBVdb and performed a regular expression search for (TG)+ repeats. While we found a number of clusters of repeated T or G nucleotides throughout the HBV genome, we found few conserved TG stretches with more than two repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6A</xref>). However, experimentally confirmed TARDBP RNA binding sites typically indicate some degree of flexibility in this basic pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6B</xref>). Therefore, we performed a fuzzy search in which gaps were penalized over mismatches for each of the 11 experimentally determined TARDBP RNA-binding motifs listed in the RBPDB database of RNA-binding protein specificities. We uploaded the highest scoring matches in BED format to the NCBI Graphics panel for the HBV reference sequence KR819180.1. We observed a number of matches within the X transcript overlapping the core promoter/enhancer II region and found other clusters within the S and core transcripts, as well as a match downstream of the polyadenylation site (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6C</xref>). These results suggest that TARDBP might interact with HBV transcripts within the 3′ non-coding regions shared by all transcripts and might interact with HBV RNA in the same region as the DNA binding site in the core promoter/enhancer II region. In the future, we will attempt to experimentally confirm these potential RNA interaction sites and determine their role in HBV replication. In all, our data shows that in addition to DNA, TARDBP is also able to interact with HBV mRNA and, consequently, plays a role in inhibition of pgRNA splicing to enhance HBV gene expression.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TARDBP regulates HBV pgRNA splicing.

TARDBP was originally identified as a cellular factor that binds strongly to double-stranded HIV-1 TAR DNA to repress transcription from the HIV-1 LTR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Subsequent studies confirmed this role for the protein as a transcriptional repressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, more recent research has demonstrated that TARDBP can indeed also work as a transcriptional activator by binding to the LPS-responsive element in the TNF-α promoter to increase TNF-α expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Our study provides several lines of evidence that TARDBP acts as a positive regulator of HBV. First, silencing of TARDBP diminished HBV gene expression. Secondly, TARDBP could activate transcription from the HBV core promoter. Thirdly, HBV benefits from the nuclear localization of TARDBP and its ability to assemble protein complexes that are already known to support various stages of viral replication. Finally, the protein served an inhibitory role on pgRNA splicing, which is likely to facilitate nuclear export of the non-canonical unspliced viral RNAs for HBV gene expression.</p><p id="Par15">Known HBV-associated transcription factors either bind to the core promoter directly or regulate transcription indirectly as co-activators or co-repressors via interaction with other molecules. For instance, several host transcription factors have been reported to indirectly activate the HBV core promoter, such as SIRT1, Cyclin D2 and jumonji C domain-containing 5 (JMJD5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. On the other hand, many other transcription factors bind directly to the core promoter, including CAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP TF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, among others. The present study adds a new transcription factor to this list, as we observed direct binding of TARDBP to the core promoter, resulting in a positive effect on transcription. Our findings confirm prior reports that TARDBP can function both as a transcriptional repressor and as an activator. This pattern has been reported for Spindlin1, a protein that could transcriptionally repress HBV in the context of infection by binding to HBV cccDNA, whereas previous research had focused on its role in transcriptional activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. The molecular mechanisms responsible for both transcriptional activation and repression by TARDBP remain unreported. However, it is possible that the molecular switch between repressor and activator functions can be influenced by the infection model or cell type, post-translational modifications, or interactions with different proteins. It will therefore be important to characterize the conditions that favor one transcriptional function of TARDBP over the other.</p><p id="Par16">By performing mutagenesis assays, we demonstrated that deletion of the RNA/DNA binding motifs abolished the transactivation effect of TARDBP on the core promoter. This observation is consistent with previous reports that both domains are necessary for nucleic acid interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The motifs were also crucial for the ability of TARDBP to bind to HIV TAR DNA, as deletion of the glycine rich C-terminus had no effect, whereas deletion of the ribonucleoprotein binding motifs abolished the interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In our case, we noted that deletion of RRM1 only partially reduced the effect, whereas deletion of RRM2 completely abolished the effect. This is contrary to previous reports in which RRM1 was found to play the dominant role, while RRM2 was dispensable or played only a supportive role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. It is conceivable that both domains are necessary for interaction with DNA, but their respective functions might depend on an unknown factor. On the other hand, while the glycine rich C-terminal domain of TARDBP was not necessary for binding to the core promoter, it still played a separate but important role in supporting HBV replication. As the motif is important for interaction with other proteins, we found a substantial number of factors that are already known to support the HBV viral lifecycle as interacting partners of TARDBP.</p><p id="Par17">Whereas most studies have emphasized the preference of TARDBP for TG-rich DNA sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, it has recently become clear that the protein can also interact with other nucleotide motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In agreement with Furukawa <italic>et al</italic>., we showed that regions containing TG, GG, TT, and GT nucleotide pairs play important roles in binding, whereas an intervening region with AA pairs was apparently dispensable, although we do not discount the possibility that this region could serve as a spacer sequence and that the nucleotide composition could allow the DNA molecule to flex in order to facilitate the formation of protein complexes. The initial report of TARDBP binding to HIV TAR DNA actually showed that the protein bound to pyrimidine-rich sequences but not to TG repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. They also demonstrated that two separate groups of pyrimidine-rich residues were crucial for TARDBP binding to TAR DNA, as mutations in either of the residues abolished the binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we observed that TARDBP failed to bind to the DNA sequence when either of the two target sequences was mutated. KLF15 is another protein which has been shown to bind to the core promoter via two binding sites, for which mutation of one of the sites abolished the binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. While it is not yet known how TARDBP binds to two sites simultaneously, we speculate that two molecules of TARDBP bind to the core promoter in the form of homodimers, as TARDBP molecules are known to bind to one another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In support of this model, our supershift assay demonstrated that two (instead of one) shifted bands existed in the same assay condition. In this scenario, we speculate that in the sample mixture, the antibody bound to either or both of the two TARDBP molecules in the protein-DNA complex, resulting in a single and double shift, respectively. This was further confirmed by an immunoprecipitation experiment where an anti-FLAG antibody precipitated both the FLAG-tagged (exogenous) and endogenous protein.</p><p id="Par18">In this study we showed that DNA binding of TARDBP to the core promoter directly up-regulates HBV transcription. However, TARDBP is a multifunctional protein that can bind to either RNA or DNA and is well known to bind to 3′ UTR regulatory regions or splicing regulatory sites in RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. TARDBP is also known to interact with a number of proteins, most of which belong to two major functional categories, RNA processing in the nucleus and protein translation in the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Our LC-MS/MS results revealed a large number of potential interaction partners (NPM1, PARP1, Hsp90, HNRNPC, SFPQ, PTBP1, HNRNPK and PUF60), several of which have already been reported to affect HBV replication via, e.g., transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, nuclear export, or nucleocapsid assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. HBV faces several RNA processing challenges, including avoiding RNA degradation, preventing unwanted splicing, and exporting the non-canonical viral transcripts from the nucleus. Export of mRNA from the nucleus normally involves formation of ribonucleoprotein particles and is tightly coupled to splicing; therefore, export of non-canonical unspliced HBV RNA transcripts and pgRNA from the nucleus poses a challenge for the virus and requires recruitment of adapter proteins to facilitate transfer through the nuclear pore. Given the ability of TARDBP to alter or silence RNA splicing and the protein’s capacity to interact with a large number of proteins involved in RNA metabolism, as well as the presence of both nuclear import and export signals, we speculated that TARDBP might play a role in RNA processing and export of HBV transcripts. In support of this hypothesis, we were able to detect HBV mRNA in TARDBP precipitate, suggesting an interaction between HBV RNA and TARDBP. Furthermore, in a recent study, Duriez <italic>et al</italic>. performed RNA pull-down assays followed by LC-MS analysis to detect pgRNA-interacting proteins and identified TARDBP as a potential interaction partner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. They observed that 15% of the RNA-interacting proteins were directly associated with splicing and noted that pgRNA splicing results in formation of HBV splicing-generated protein (HBSP), which confers a protective effect against immune-mediated hepatic injury through down-regulation of CCL2 expression. In this study, we demonstrated that TARDBP inhibits splicing of pgRNA in T23 cells and showed that TARDBP knockdown enhanced pgRNA splicing. Further research is necessary to confirm whether TARDBP plays a role in HBV splicing and/or nuclear export, but our current findings suggest that disruption of TARDBP-protein complex formation may yield seeds for anti-HBV drug development.</p><p id="Par19">Briefly, we identified TARDBP as a host factor that facilitates HBV gene expression by stimulating transcription from the core promoter, assembly of protein complexes implicated in transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages of the virus life cycle, and suppressing pgRNA splicing during nuclear export. Our results provide valuable insight into the interaction between host factors and HBV. TARDBP may thus serve as an effective target for novel anti-HBV therapies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Plasmids, Oligos, siRNA and shRNA</title><p id="Par20">Full-length TARDBP was amplified from a human brain cDNA library (Clontech) and cloned into the BamHI-HindIII site of pcDNA3.1 (−) (Invitrogen) with a 5′ FLAG tag inserted through the NotI-EcoRI site.

We employed the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated destabilization domain (DD)-tag knock-in strategy, which allows rapid conditional knock-down of protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. To generate stable knock-in cell lines, NTCP-HepG2 cells were inoculated at 8 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/six-well plate with no-antibiotics medium, and after 24 hours, the cells were co-transfected with each 0.5 μg of TARDBP_guide 1/pX330, TARDBP_guide 3/pX330, TARDBP puro-DD knock-in plasmid and TARDBP bla-DD knock-in plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>), using Lipofectamine 3000 as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). At 24 hours post-transfection, 100 nM Shield-1 (Clontech) was added to the culture medium, and cells were subsequently always maintained in Shield-1. Beyond 24 hours, the medium was replaced with that containing 1.5 μg/mL puromycin, 1.5 μg/mL blasticidin and antibiotics. At ≥30 days post-transfection, colonies were isolated and expanded. Gene knockout was confirmed by western blotting. In the destabilizing domain (DD) knock-in strategy, the protein is fused to the DD tag such that, in the absence of the DD specific ligand (Shield-1), the protein is degraded by the proteasome. However, when Shield1 is added to the culture medium, the fusion protein should accumulate within 24 hours. Unfortunately, our attempts to add Shield-1 led to failure to detect any TARDBP protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2A</xref>). Henceforth, for the rescue experiments, TARDBP was expressed in TARDBP KO cells using a transiently transfected plasmid.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays</title><p id="Par36">For HBV promoter analysis, the ChIP assay was performed on genomic DNA samples from the HBV-producing cell line T23 using the ChIP-IT Express Enzymatic kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Active Motif, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, T23 cells were grown to confluency in 10 cm dishes and cross-linked with formaldehyde. The reaction was stopped by glycine followed by cell lysis with the cold lysis buffer provided in the kit. Chromatin was sheared from the lysates with the enzymatic shearing cocktail and immunoprecipitated overnight with the magnetic beads in the presence of antibodies. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were the rabbit anti-TARDBP and the rabbit control IgG (MBL, Life science). Chromatin was eluted from the beads and crosslinking reversed with 5 M NaCl. The samples were treated with proteinase K and subjected to qPCR analysis by the CFX96<sup>TM</sup> Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan).

The pRL-TK plasmid (Promega, USA) was transfected with the reporter plasmid in all wells to normalize the transfection efficiency. At 48 hours after transfections, the cells were lysed in the Passive Lysis Buffer and assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (both by Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The probes were labelled with biotin using the Pierce Biotin 3′ End DNA Labeling Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The recombinant GST-TARDBP protein used in EMSA was produced as described above. The EMSA reaction was carried out using the Pierce LightShift™ Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit. A 20 μl EMSA reaction was performed as per the manufacturer’s protocol with 2 μg (or as indicated) of TARDBP protein, 1% BSA, 100 fmol of labeled probe, and ×200 (or as indicated) amount of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor. For the super-shift assays, the EMSA reaction was performed in the presence of 2 μg of the rabbit anti-TARDBP antibody. After 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE.
