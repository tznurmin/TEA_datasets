sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Epsilon toxin (Etx) is a pore-forming toxin (PFT) produced by <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> type B and D strains and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of enterotoxaemia, a severe neurological disease of domestic ruminants, particularly sheep. More recently, Etx has been implicated in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Etx is typically secreted by the bacterium in the gut as a relatively inactive, water-soluble monomer, called protoxin (P-Etx), with an estimated molecular weight of 32.9 kDa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The protoxin is converted to the active, mature toxin after carboxy- and amino-termini peptides are removed by proteolytic cleavage in the gut, either by digestive proteases of the host, such as trypsin, or protease produced by <italic>C. perfringens</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Toxin activation generates a more acidic protein (isoelectric point of 5.4 vs. 8.3) that is nearly 1000 times more toxic than its progenitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. By a mechanism unknown, Etx crosses the gut wall, enters the blood stream and accumulates preferentially in the brain and kidneys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Etx is a member of the aerolysin family of β-PFTs (aβ-PFTs). Members of the aβ-PFTs are found in all kingdoms of life and can be used for either attack or defence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Other bacterial toxins from the aβ-PFTs that play a role in disease include aerolysin from the human pathogen <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, enterotoxin (CPE) from <italic>C. perfringens</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, α-toxin from <italic>Clostridium septicum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and monalysin from <italic>Pseudomonas entomophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Other members of the aβ-PFTs serve in defence, such as lysenin produced by immune cells of the earthworm <italic>Eisenia fetida</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, assist in prey digestion, such as hydralysins from <italic>Cnidaria</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, or have cytocidal activity against human cancer cells, such as parasporin-2 from <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">As evidenced by their crystal structures, members of the aβ-PFTs share an overall similar domain arrangement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. They typically contain one or more receptor-binding domains (RBDs) and a pore-forming module (PFM), a well-conserved structural element of the aβ-PFTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The PFM, rich in serine and threonine residues, contains a flexible membrane insertion loop flanked by pre-insertion strands that refold into an amphipathic β-hairpin during pore formation to create the transmembrane β-barrel of the pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The crystal structure of the water-soluble, monomeric P-Etx was solved by Cole et al. in 2004<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and revealed an elongated molecule composed mainly of β-sheets, with two strands traversing the entire molecule. The suggested RBD at the amino terminus contains a cluster of surface-exposed aromatic amino acids critical for cell binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and the PFM at the carboxy terminus is suggested to play a role in oligomerization and pore formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The PFM also contains a C-terminal peptide (CTP), proteolytic removal of which is essential for toxin activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> as interaction of the CTP with the pre-insertion strands restricts their movement, thus preventing pore formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A glycan (β-octyl-glucoside (β-OG)) binding site has also recently been identified in the PFM, suggesting that Etx may have two distinct receptor-binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Etx is unique amongst aβ-PFTs as it shows high potency and high cell specificity. The 50% lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) in mice after intravenous administration of the toxin is reported to be 100 ng kg<sup>−1</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which is equivalent to 7 μg per 70 kg human. This makes Etx the third most potent clostridial toxin after botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. For this reason, Etx is classified as a potential biological weapon in some countries and as a category B biological agent by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading public health institute of the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Among the many cell lines tested, only a few are susceptible to Etx. Most in vitro studies on Etx, including this study, have been performed using the Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line as this cell line is the most sensitive to the toxin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The cell specificity of Etx suggests that the toxin binds to a specific receptor in the membrane of target cells and this is likely to explain why the toxin is over 1000 times more potent compared to other aβ-PFTs.</p><p id="Par9">To date, two putative Etx receptors have been identified: the O-linked glycoprotein hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and the tetraspan membrane proteolipid myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The molecular basis for the interaction of these putative receptors with Etx remains unknown, although it is thought that the binding site for Etx on the glycoprotein HAVCR1 includes one of the sugar components, while in MAL the second extracellular loop is critical for binding and cytotoxicity of Etx. Etx can also interact with artificial lipid bilayers and form functional pores without the help of receptors, albeit with less efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Both inactive P-Etx and activated toxin can bind to cells, but only activated toxin with CTP removed can form heptameric pre-pores on the membrane surface in the next step of pore formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Finally, the heptamer, with a molecular mass of approximately 155–174 kDa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, inserts into the membrane, which is triggered by significant structural rearrangements within the PFM of each protomer in the complex. Pore formation disrupts the membrane and is central to the damage caused to intoxicated cells, and consequently to the symptoms of disease, due to the leakage of water and small ions through the pores that may lead to cell death.</p><p id="Par11">Whilst atomic resolution structures of the water-soluble, monomeric forms have been determined for many members of the aβ-PFTs over the past few decades, their corresponding pore structures have only recently been revealed. The lysenin pore was the first high-resolution structure of the aβ-PFTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. A 3.9 Å structure of the aerolysin pre-pore and a 7.5 Å structure of aerolysin pore have also been determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Etx pore determined here provides further insights into the molecular details of structural rearrangements during pore formation of the aβ-PFTs. These results will have important implications for the development of novel therapeutics aimed at the functional disruption of pore formation to prevent human and animal diseases, and are relevant for nano-biotechnology applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Isolation of the Etx pore</title><p id="Par13">The formation of biologically active oligomers has been a limiting factor for obtaining structural information of the pore form of Etx. Unlike aerolysin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, Etx does not spontaneously oligomerize into sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-resistant species when activated in aqueous buffer, and negatively stained EM samples do not reveal regular particles other than elongated monomers and small clumps (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). Furthermore, efficient oligomerization cannot be promoted by the addition of liposomes of various lipid compositions or detergent micelles. The uncertainty in receptor identity combined with the high cell specificity of Etx prompted us to investigate if the pores could be assembled on susceptible cells and then purified for structural studies. We assembled Etx oligomers that were biologically active towards Super Dome cells, a clone of MDCK cells that forms domes that are approximately five times the area of MDCK cells, thus exhibiting exceptional sensitivity to Etx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The cytotoxic activity of trypsin-activated recombinant wild-type Etx towards Super Dome cells was measured using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. The average dose of recombinant Etx required to kill 50% of Super Dome cells (CT<sub>50</sub>) was 2.47 ± 0.47 nM (SEM) or 78.27 ± 14.89 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> (SEM) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

The extremely low yields (∼10 µg from 6 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells) meant that we could not pursue additional clean-up steps, such as size-exclusion chromatography. This heterogeneity hindered particle identification and selection using manual or automated picking procedures (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Despite this, an initial dataset of 613 micrographs resulted in ∼14,000 particles after 2D and 3D classification clean-up steps and produced a map that reached 4.6 Å, at which resolution the β-strands just begin to separate (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>, inset). We reasoned that the use of a Volta phase plate (VPP) would be advantageous for two reasons. First, the contrast of the protein component would increase, aiding particle picking and alignment. Second, the number of particles required to achieve a high-resolution structure could decrease as compared to conventional defocused data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

As in lysenin, in fact the β-barrel recruits polypeptide from the flanking β-strands on either side of the insertion loop so that the β-hairpin domain actually comprises residues 95–173. The lumen of the pore is mostly lined with serine and threonine residues, yet another characteristic of the aerolysin family, but asparagine and glutamine residues are also present. Additionally, a number of salt bridges are present (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8c–e</xref>). Forming intra-chain bridges are Lys99-Asp168 and Lys108-Glu159. Lys130 with Glu137 form an inter-chain salt bridge, which stabilizes the β-barrel near the intracellular side of the pore in addition to the hydrogen bonding network. The overall charge distribution in the lumen is therefore neutral (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9b</xref>). At its narrowest point the diameter of the lumen is constricted to ~12 Å by the seven Lys108 residues, which protrude into the lumen (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8a, 9b</xref>, rectangle). The structure corroborates studies that show Etx has only a slight preference for anions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The β-turn at the intracellular side is formed by Thr132, Val133, Pro134 and Phe135. Aerolysin and Etx are conserved in this region. Pro134 is equivalent to Pro248 in aerolysin and, as in aerolysin, the β-turn main chain protrudes sideways, forming a rivet to anchor the barrel at the intracellular side (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">The external surface of the Etx inner β-barrel reveals a number of interesting features (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). In the intracellular side of the membrane two aromatic residues, Phe131 and Phe135, form the usual aromatic belt found in β-barrel transmembrane regions. However, in the extracellular side of the membrane there are two aromatic belts. One is formed by Tyr146 ~30 Å from the tip, and the other formed by His119 (H106 in Etx without propeptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>) and Phe148 ~35 Å from the tip.</p><p id="Par19">Examination of the unfiltered maps indicates that the detergent micelle density extends above His119 and Phe148, suggesting that these residues will be interacting with the membrane (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the membrane-inserted region in the Etx pore comprises residues 119–148, close to the original prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly, histidine residues were also found in the detergent micelle region of lysenin above the standard aromatic belt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Examination of D250 and H162 in the monomeric Etx crystal structure indicates that D250 and H162 are not involved in any interactions, suggesting that the importance of these residues lies in the H162–D250 hydrogen bond formed in the oligomer. SDS-PAGE analysis of oligomer formation revealed that both Etx-D250A and Etx-H162A produce SDS-resistant oligomers of the same apparent molecular weight as wild-type Etx (∼155 kDa, consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13, lanes 11–13</xref>).

In addition to the CTP, other significant clashes occur near the oligomerization surfaces on either side of a monomer, indicating again that some rearrangement will have to happen. Finally, the hypothetical insertion loop or tongue also creates clashes upon monomer association and, as described previously for lysenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, the displacement of the tongue region may be the driving force for the pre-insertion strands to unfold and the formation of the inner β-barrel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">The pore form of Etx has long eluded structural determination, mostly owing to the difficulty of forming biologically active Etx oligomers in liposomes of various lipid compositions or detergent micelles without a receptor, which is unknown. Thus, the only viable way to study the pore form of Etx was to isolate the complexes directly from cells known to be susceptible to Etx. In this study, the use of Super Dome cells, reported to have 3- to 78-fold increased sensitivity to Etx relative to MDCK cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, combined with the use of increased concentration of DDM (2% (w/v)) relative to 0.05% (w/v) used in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> maximized pore yield for subsequent purification, and thus were critical for structural determination of the Etx pore complex. Furthermore, due to the very small quantities of material that can be isolated from the membrane of cultured cells and the heterogeneity of the purified samples, cryo-EM technique was the only structural method that could be employed. Use of the VPP proved essential in our studies to achieve high resolution, owing to the challenging sample rather than its molecular mass (∼225 kDa). First, particles could be identified by the automatic and manual picking procedures more efficiently, resulting in more particles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Second, the overall quality of the data, as judged by <italic>B</italic>-factor estimation from both datasets, was higher for the VPP data, meaning we could achieve higher resolution than with the non-VPP data, given the number of particles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). While this manuscript was under review, another cryo-EM study of a relatively large complex (~500 kDa) also benefited by the use of the VPP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, suggesting that VPP use could be advantageous for certain specimens that are not size limited. The resulting map at 3.2 Å resolution allowed an unambiguous model to be built for Etx pore.</p><p id="Par26">A number of interesting mutants of Etx have been studied in the past whilst trying to understand how Etx transitions from the water-soluble to the pore form. Mutating H149 (H162 in our model) to alanine resulted in a significant decrease in activity of the recombinant toxin both in vitro and in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. However, substitution with serine at position 162 does not abolish lethal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, suggesting that H162A is less active not because of removal of the bulky imidazole side chain, but possibly due to the loss of a hydrogen bond donor at this position. H162, located in the membrane-distal part of the inner β-barrel, has previously been equated to aerolysin Y221, and recent studies proposed that, similar to the aerolysin Y221G mutant, the Etx-H162A mutant may prevent the β-hairpin domain involved in pore formation from unfolding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. However, unlike the aerolysin Y221G mutant, the Etx-H162A mutant did not reveal water-soluble, heptameric pre-pore particles by negative stain EM (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">Examination of the Etx pore structure reveals that H162 may also play a role in stabilizing the DBB fold by forming a hydrogen bond with D250 in the cap domain. This interaction will stabilize the DBB fold further in addition to the hydrophobic interactions and make it more rigid. In agreement with this hypothesis, substitution of aspartate with alanine at position 250 results in a completely inactive Etx that displays ∼95% reduction in SDS-resistant oligomers relative to wild-type Etx. The reduced oligomerization of Etx-D250A and its complete inactivity towards Super Dome cells could be a result of either oligomer instability or a reduction in oligomer formation. Since D250 does not participate in any inter-chain interactions in the oligomer, we cannot explain the latter. The abolished cytotoxicity of Etx-D250A suggests that the SDS-resistant oligomers resembling the wild-type ones may correspond to pre-pores or post pre-pores. This may explain why Etx-D250A oligomers resembling the wild-type ones were not observed by native-PAGE immunoblot. Pre-pores or post-pre-pores are expected to migrate differently to pores on native-PAGE as they will lack any associated detergents or lipids.</p><p id="Par28">Further evidence for the importance of the DBB stability in pore formation also comes from previous mutagenesis studies.

Similar to aerolysin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, in order for Etx to cross the thick layer of glycocalyx covering the apical side of the plasma membrane of gut epithelial cells, Etx may initially bind to surface oligosaccharides with low affinity, possibly through the β-OG binding site at the carboxy terminus, before it binds with high affinity to its receptor on the membrane surface through the RBD at the amino terminus. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that polarized epithelial cells are more sensitive to Etx from their apical side, which is more abundant in oligosaccharides, than from their basolateral side<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.
