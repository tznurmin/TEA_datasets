Periodontitis is accompanied by connective tissue breakdown and impaired immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. During the development of periodontitis, cytokine production in gingival epithelium is accelerated by bacterial infections, leading to local or even systemic inflammatory responses and loss of tooth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The occurrence of periodontitis is affected by multiple risk factors, such as obesity, aging, diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. With the growth of aging population and increase incidence of obesity and diabetes, prevalence of periodontitis is predicted to be significantly increased in near future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, novel therapeutic targets for periodontitis are always needed.</p><p id="Par9">It has been well accepted that only less than 2% of the transcriptions of mammalian genome is related to protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], most mammalian genes are only transcribed to non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which lacks protein coding capacity but are critical determinants in many cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A major subgroup of ncRNAs is long ncRNAs, which are composed of more than 200 nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the function of most lncRNAs is still unknown and most lncRNAs studies are focused on certain lethal diseases, such as different types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies in past several years also showed that the development of periodontitis is also accompanied by changed in expression patterns of a large set of lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Certain lncRNA, such ANCR and MEG3 regulate osteogenic differentiation to participate in the pathogenesis of periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. LncRNA PTCSC3 has been characterized as a tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], while its roles in other human diseases are unclear. Our RNA-seq data showed that PTCSC3 was likely downregulated in periodontitis, and its expression levels were inversely correlated with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which promotes periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, it will be reasonable to hypothesize that PTCSC3 may also participate in periodontitis. This study aimed to investigate the role of PTCSC3 in periodontitis and explored its interactions with TLR4 by performing overexpression experiments, which recovered the downregulation of PTCSC3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and PDLSCs</title><p id="Par10">Periodontal ligament tissues were collected from periodontitis-affected third molars of 34 patients with periodontitis (patient group) during tooth extraction and form healthy third molars of 34 non-periodontitis patients (control group) who received orthodontic treatment.

The key finding of the present study is that PTCSC3 was downregulated in periodontitis-affected PDLSCs and overexpression of PTCSC3 may improve periodontitis by inhibiting the proliferation of PDLSCs and downregulating the expression of TLR4.</p><p id="Par21">TLR4 is a transmembrane protein that mediates the production of inflammatory cytokines involved in the activation of the innate immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. TLR4 is usually highly expressed in periodontal ligament mesenchymal stem cells and activation of TLR4 can mediate immune recognition of periodontal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], indicating its involvement in periodontitis. In a recent study, Ilievski et al. reported that TLR4 overexpression was closely correlated with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Consistent with previous studies, our study also showed the upregulation of TLR4 in periodontitis-affected PDLSCs. The abnormal proliferation of PDLSCs contributes to the development of periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the present study, TLR4 overexpression showed no significant effects on proliferation of periodontitis-affected PDLSCs. Therefore, TLR4 may participate in periodontitis through PDLSCs proliferation-independent pathways.</p><p id="Par22">PTCSC3 is a tumor suppressor in both thyroid carcinoma and glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and overexpression of PTCSC3 inhibits tumor progression by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. Consistently, our study also showed that PTCSC3 overexpression is an inhibitor of the proliferation of periodontitis-affected PDLSCs. Therefore, overexpression of PTCSC3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for periodontitis. However, more clinical and experimental experiments are needed to further confirm this conclusion.</p><p id="Par23">It is known that the expression of TLR4 can be regulated by certain lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, our study proved that PTCSC3 was likely an upstream inhibitor of TLR4 in periodontitis-affected PDLSCs. Therefore, PTCSC3 may indirectly regulate immune recognition of periodontal pathogens by downregulating TLR4. It is worth noting that certain pathological mediators may exist between PTCSC3 and TLR4 due to the fact that expression levels of PTCSC3 and TLR4 were only significantly correlated in periodontitis-affected PDLSCs, but not in healthy PDLSCs. It is known that lncRNAs can sponge miRNAs to regulate their downstream targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our future study will explore the possible involvement of miRNAs in the interaction between PTCSC3 and TLR4. However, a miRNA sponge usually upregulate its targets. In this study PTCSC3 overexpression led to downregulated not upregulated TLR4. Therefore, other mechanisms, such as certain signaling pathways involved in this interaction should also be examed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par24">In conclusion, PTCSC3 was downregulated in periodontitis, and overexpression of PTCSC3 may improve periodontitis by inhibiting the proliferation of PDLSCs and downregulating TLR4.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>LW performed most experiments.
