Previous studies have suggested that HHT combined with ATO can synergistically kill U937 cells, and HHT has also demonstrated the ability to kill leukemia stem cells. We evaluated whether HHT combined with ATO can systematically kill leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and explored the synergistic effect and molecular mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">CCK-8 was used to detect cell viability. The changes of cell cycle (PI staining), apoptosis (Annexin V/PI) and surface markers (CD34, CD38, CD96, CD45) were detected by flow cytometry. The cells of CD34+ primary leukemia and CD38- KG-1, and TF-1 were separated by flow cytometry. High-throughput mRNA sequencing was used to analysis mRNA level changes after the application of the two drugs. Western blot was used to verify the changes of pathway protein expression. NRG mice were used as the receptor of xenograft model. Histological H&amp;E staining assess the invaded ability of leukemia cells, and laser scanning confocal microscopy evaluated the molecule markers change.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">HHT and ATO synergistically killed KG-1 (CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD96<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>+</sup>/<sup>−</sup>) and Kasumi-1 (CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>−</sup>) cells. Their combination had a stronger effect of inducing apoptosis and blocking the cell cycle than HHT or ATO administrator alone, meanwhile significantly reducing the numbers of LSCs. Further, CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>−</sup> cells in KG-1, KG-1a, TF-1, and primary leukemia cells were more sensitive to HHT and ATO. High-throughput mRNA sequencing suggested that HHT alone could significantly upregulate molecules related to the Notch, P53, and NF-κB signaling pathways. When combined with ATO, HHT further upregulated P53, whereas HHT-induced NF-κB pathway activation was significantly suppressed. Western blot analysis verified the change of protein expression in the above pathways and further demonstrated that GSI, could eliminate these effects. In vivo, HHT combined with ATO significantly reduced the LSC burden, and weakened the expression of LSC markers.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This is the first

Although multi-drug combinational chemotherapy can reduce the remission risk, relapse nevertheless is common. Accumulating evidence points to leukemia stem cells (LSCs) as the root of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, inducing damage to LSCs would be an effective approach to reduce the relapse rate of AML.</p><p id="Par15">LSCs are a specific subgroup of AML cells. The current paradigm states that LSCs of AML are part of the CD34-positive and CD38-negative cell population and thus can be distinguished by various molecular markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. CD96 has recently been applied for the identification of LSCs among CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>−</sup> AML cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; however, there are few studies on this marker. Moreover, the multitudinous cell lines KG-1, KG-1a, Kasumi-1, and TF-1 also contain CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>−</sup> AML cells, with essentially all of these lines being CD34<sup>+</sup>. Accordingly, these cells are most widely used to study LSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Homoharringtonine (HHT) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) have been traditionally used in the treatment of AML in China separately; however, little is known about the effects of their combination. The first report of their combined use was conducted in the multiple myeloma cell line RPMI8226 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Subsequently, these two agents were shown to exhibit a synergistic effect in killing AML cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the synergistic anti-proliferative effects of HHT and ATO on LSCs, and the underlying mechanism, remain to be clarified. Thus, we examined the effects of these two agents on LSCs using the cell lines listed above as well as in a xenograft model in vivo. We further explored the potential effects of these agents alone and in combination on the Notch, p53, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways as a candidate mechanism.</p><p id="Par17">Notch is a cell-surface receptor forming a heterodimer comprising extracellular and transmembrane subunits and is typically expressed in both normal hematopoietic cells and leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The main effect of Notch is the induction of stem cell proliferation, although recent studies have identified various roles according to cell and disease types. In lymphopoiesis, Notch1 and Notch2 affect T and B cell differentiation and proliferation, respectively; however, their roles in myeloid lineages, especially in LSCs, are not fully clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. P53 and p21 are important tumor suppressor proteins, and p53 induces the expression of p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. HHT has been shown to enhance p53/p21 expression in <italic>FLT3-ITD</italic> mutant AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but this effect in LSCs and the consequence for cell proliferation are not well understood. Moreover, p53/p21 expression is induced by Notch ligand in myeloid lineage cells overexpressing Notch/Hes1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, this effect of HHT on Notch upregulation and subsequent p53/p21 pathway activation might also underlie the killing mechanism of LSCs.</p><p id="Par18">NF-κB is a transcription factor that is constitutively activated in primitive AML cells, and its expression can be reduced by HHT in multiple myeloma cells, while ATO was shown to suppress NF-κB activation in mantle cell lymphoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Like p53, the NF-κB pathway is also a target of Notch downstream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the effects of HHT and ATO on the NF-κB pathway in LSCs are unknown.</p><p id="Par19">Here, we used CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>−</sup> KG-1 and Kasumi-1 cells along with CD34<sup>+</sup> primary-cultured cells from patients with AML to investigate the synergistic effect of HHT and ATO in LSCs in vitro<italic>.</italic> In addition, NRG mice injected with KG-1 cells were used as an in vivo xenograft model to investigate the effects of treatment with HHT and ATO alone or in combination. Overall, we demonstrate a synergistic effect of HHT and ATO, inducing greater damage to LSCs in vitro and in vivo than these two drugs using alone. and highlight a link between activation of the tumor suppressor P53 pathway and inhibition of the NIK and NF-κB pathways. These findings provide insight into the pathogenesis of AML, while highlighting key molecules to effectively target LSCs and reduce the risk of remission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary patient and cell lines culture</title><p id="Par20">Mononuclear cells were extracted with a Nicoll–plaque (Haoyang, Tianjin, China) gradient centrifugation method from bone marrow blood samples of patients newly diagnosed with AML (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and samples of benign anemia patients and of allotransplantation patient whose bone marrow showed complete remission (three samples in total), which were preserved when drawing blood for diagnosis after obtaining informed consent.

Here, we expand these findings by demonstrating that HHT and ATO synergistically reduced the proportion of LSCs in the Kasumi-1 and KG-1 cells, as well as in primary bone marrow cells. Moreover, we identified the underlying mechanism. However, the reason for the decreasing proportion of LSCs was unknown. At first, despite qPCR results indicating that ATO enhanced the effects of HHT in reducing the expression of levels <italic>CD34</italic> and <italic>CD96</italic> mRNA and upregulating <italic>CD38</italic> expression, cell differentiation was not observed.

Our results further confirm these findings with a larger sample size along with confirmation in other cell lines. Apoptotic cells (Annexin V<sup>+</sup> cells) largely localized in the section of CD38<sup>−</sup> or CD38<sup>low</sup> cells in all three cell lines; namely, HHT or HHT combined with ATO more effectively killed CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>−</sup> KG-1, KG-1a, TF-1 cells than CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>+</sup> cells. We further validated the decrease of primary CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>−</sup>/CD96<sup>+</sup> cells and a higher apoptosis rate of primary CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>−</sup> or CD38<sup>low</sup> cells than CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>+</sup> cells in bone marrow cells after treatment with HHT and ATO. These findings were confirmed in CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>−</sup> KG-1 and TF-1 cells analyzed separately, demonstrating that HHT does not simply inhibit the expression of all proteins through apoptosis induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

This suggested further synergic mechanisms, which were identified as regulation of the Notch, NF-kB, and P53 pathways.</p><p id="Par46">Notch is considered to be an oncogene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; however, its role in AML has been controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

We believe that this is, at least, part of the mechanism underlying the synergic effect of these two drugs on LSCs.
