However, clinical translation of bacteria for these applications has been largely restricted by their unavoidable side effects and low treatment efficacies. Engineered bacteria for biomedical applications ideally need to generate only a low inflammatory response, show slow elimination by macrophages, low accumulation in normal organs, and almost unchanged inherent bioactivities. Here we describe a set of stealth bacteria, cell membrane coated bacteria (CMCB), meeting these requirement. Our findings are supported by evaluation in multiple mice models and ultimately demonstrate the potential of CMCB to serve as efficient tumor imaging agents. Stealth bacteria wrapped up with cell membranes have the potential for a myriad of bacterial-mediated biomedical applications.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">The use of engineered bacteria for biomedical applications is limited by side effects such as inflammatory response.

Microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria exhibit promising potential as therapeutics, bioimaging, and diagnostic agents because of their unique characteristics including genetic manipulation, rapid proliferation, and disease site targeting specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although viruses have been utilized for genetic therapeutics to permanently overexpress protein drugs or interfering RNAs in target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, the utility of viruses is largely limited by their rapid spread, difficulty to eliminate and potential to cause serious infections. Bacteria, another group of broadly used microorganisms, are relatively manipulable and safe, because they are easy to be modified genetically and can be controlled by antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. More importantly, various bacterial species are able to colonize specific body sites of mammalian hosts, for example the gut or the skin, as well as disease sites including abscesses and tumor tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Based on these characteristics, bacteria have been widely administrated orally as probiotics to prevent pathogen colonization, or injected as bacterial-mediated tumor therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. More recently, a variety of bacterial therapeutics have been implemented in humans and entered into phase I clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, severe side effects may arise in a dose-dependent manner, despite the attenuated nature of the organisms used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, the therapeutic efficiency remains low, as most of the administrated bacteria are cleared by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) before colonizing specific target sites. As reported, phase I clinical trials of <italic>Salmonella</italic> VNP20009 were terminated owing to its low therapeutic efficacy and the emergence of high toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The current barriers for in vivo applications of bacteria are low treatment efficiency resulting from rapid clearance and unavoidable side effects caused by immunogenicity.</p><p id="Par4">Surface decoration is an efficient method to enhance the in vivo performance of implanted biomedical devices and therapeutic agents. A variety of materials such as synthetic polymers, liposomes, and biological membranes have been explored for surface modification to improve biocompatibility, targeting ability, and blood circulation. As a gold standard coating material, polyethylene glycol has been extensively used to decrease protein nonspecific absorption and prolong blood circulation time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Liposomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and natural cell membrane derived vesicles have been used to coat nanoparticles to improve biocompatibility and targeting ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. For instance, erythrocyte membrane material slowed the clearance of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles significantly due to the presence of CD47 protein, a self-marker, on the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We therefore hypothesized that surface decoration of bacteria would be an alternative approach to design bacteria with an improved safety profile and enhanced efficiency for bacterial-mediated diagnosis, imaging, and therapy.</p><p id="Par5">Herein, we report a strategy to generate stealth bacteria by camouflaging with cell membrane, which we call cell-membrane-coated bacteria (CMCB), prepared by simply extruding erythrocyte membranes with bacteria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). We choose erythrocyte membranes considering the low immunogenicity and long circulating properties. This approach not only lowers the inflammatory reaction and side effects of CMCB as the bacterial immunogens are camouflaged, it also decreases the bodily clearance of CMCB because of the anti-phagocytic nature of erythrocyte membrane. Meanwhile, there are no significant effects on the bioactivities of the coated bacteria since the coating membrane is eventually removed during cell division of bacteria. Compared with uncoated bacteria, CMCB achieve (1) ~14 times higher blood reservation 48 h post-injection; (2) a lower inflammatory response; (3) lower accumulation in normal organs; (4) up to 42 times higher accumulation in tumor tissue; and (5) almost unaffected inherent bioactivities, as demonstrated in multiple mice models. This strategy is applicable to different strains such as gut microbes and therapeutic bacteria and suitable for coating with diverse cell membranes including erythrocyte, platelet, macrophage, neutrophil, and cancer cell membranes. We anticipate the camouflage of bacteria by wrapping with cell membranes to be a versatile approach for the preparation of biologically functional bacteria with improved safety and enhanced treatment efficacy and believe that the stealth bacteria coated with cell membranes represent a unique tool for biomedical applications.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Preparation and characterization of CMCB. <bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration for the preparation of CMCB by extruding bacteria with cell membranes. <bold>b</bold> Representative TEM images of uncoated bacteria and CMCB.

CMCB were prepared by simply fusing EcN with erythrocyte membranes via mechanical extrusion. Erythrocyte membranes were extracted from red blood cells of 6–8-weeks-old male Institute Cancer Research (ICR) mice following a previous method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> with minor modification (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The resultant membranes were mixed with EcN and then extruded through a porous polycarbonate membrane (pore size: 1 μm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show a clear outer lipid shell on the surface of CMCB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2a, b</xref>). We speculated that the outer layer with thickness around 100 nm was attributed to the significant dehydration of the coated bacteria before TEM observation, which resulted in the collapse of the coating membranes. To verify this hypothesis, we used synthetic micro-particles (that cannot dehydrate) with a similar size to bacteria as controls. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2c, d</xref>, the coating membranes show a thickness about 10 nm, which is in good agreement with the reported membrane width of erythrocytes. In contrast, uncoated EcN displayed a sharp edge with extended flagella. Similarly, bacteria with different shapes including elliptic <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (<italic>E. faecalis</italic>) and spherical <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) could be simply coated, showing the broad applicability of this approach to camouflage various strains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). CMCB were further visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) with the help of FITC-affinity anti-CD47-antibody labelling. The LSCM images shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> demonstrate that EcN expressing mCherry (red) were quantitatively coated with cell membranes (green). Successful coating with cell membranes was also confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, the mean fluorescence intensity of CMCB after incubation with FITC-affinity anti-CD47-antibody was about 10 times higher than that of uncoated EcN, indicating that CMCB were coated with cell membranes. Additionally, western blotting shows the existence of self-marker of CD47 protein in CMCB, demonstrating the presence of coating membranes on the bacteria (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">To examine whether the coating membranes have any effect on the viability of coated bacteria, growth curves of CMCB were recorded (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Compared to uncoated EcN, CMCB grew at a similar rate and reached the same OD<sub>600</sub> at 3 h. At the same time, bacterial viability was assessed using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). Consistent with the growth curve results, there was no notable difference in viability between uncoated EcN and CMCB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Additionally, cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and imaged to evaluate the number of dead cells. LSCM imaging indicates that the bacteria were able to grow inside the membrane vesicles, demonstrating negligible effects on bacterial viability following coating with cell membranes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>In vivo blood reservation</title><p id="Par8">We then investigated in vivo blood reservation of bacteria by injecting 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> colony forming units (CFUs) of CMCB into the tail vein of ICR mice. Twenty microliters of blood from each mouse was collected intraorbitally at predetermined time intervals. Serial dilutions were prepared and then spread onto Luria Bertani (LB) agar plates, which were further incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before bacterial counting. Although the bacteria were eliminated rapidly followed injection, the amount of bacteria remained in blood from mice treated with CMCB was much higher than that of uncoated EcN. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>, the CFUs from mice injected with CMCB at 12 and 48 h post-injection were around 4 and 14 times greater, respectively, than that of uncoated EcN, suggesting significantly increased retention of EcN in the blood circulation after wrapping with cell membranes.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Evaluation of in vivo blood reservation. <bold>a</bold> In vivo blood reservation of bacteria.

We asked the question whether the engulfment of EcN by the RES was inhibited after the bacteria were coated with cell membranes, as the RES has been recognized as the main clearance mechanism of intrusive microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. To facilitate the observations, EcN expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed and cultured with primary peritoneal macrophages isolated from ICR mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The engulfment of bacteria by macrophages was then analyzed by flow cytometry and LSCM. As expected, both the ratio of macrophages internalized with bacteria and the amount of bacteria taken up decreased by 9% and 8%, respectively, in the presence of coating membranes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). LSCM analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) agreed well with the flow cytometry results. We also measured the in vivo bacterial clearance by injecting 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFUs of CMCB into the tail vein of ICR mice. Blood was sampled and treated with lysis buffer before incubating with APC-affinity anti-CD11b-antibody for flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>, significantly decreased engulfment of bacteria by monocytes was observed for CMCB. Additionally, a set of PEGylated lipid-membrane-coated bacteria (PLCB) was prepared as a control (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2e, f</xref>). As expected, PLCB also showed improved anti-phagocytosis ability comparing to uncoated EcN in vivo (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>), indicating the decreased recognition of immune system of the host. However, the ratio of monocytes internalized with bacteria after coating with PEGylated lipid membranes increased by 46% in comparison with CMCB. The lower uptake by phagocytic cells after coating with erythrocyte membranes could be attributed to the presence of CD47 protein, a self-marker, on the surface of CMCB. These results indicate that encapsulation of EcN by cell membranes reduced in vivo bacterial clearance and therefore provided more efficient retention in blood circulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>In vivo inflammatory response</title><p id="Par10">We next tested the inflammatory reaction induced by CMCB using routine blood and cytokine assays, both of which have been commonly used to evaluate the side effects caused by bacterial treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The counts of white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), and platelet (PLT) were quantified by a standard animal blood analyzer at predetermined time points. Compared to mice injected with uncoated EcN, mice treated with CMCB displayed higher counts of WBC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, RBC, and PLT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref>), which are much closer to values measured for control mice injected with PBS than for mice injected with uncoated EcN (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). These results reveal that injection of CMCB induces a lower inflammatory response than uncoated EcN. We speculated that cytotoxins secreted from the bacteria could be encapsulated in the presence of coating membranes, which decreased the inflammatory response. More intriguingly, coating bacteria with erythrocyte membranes largely increased the detainment of the cytotoxins in contrast to PEGylated lipid membranes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>), which might be explained by the higher stability of the cell membranes. Cytokine assays were carried out by measuring the level of cytokines in serum sampled from mice injected with CMCB or free EcN at different time points post-injection using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Similarly, uncoated EcN activated a more severe inflammatory response than CMCB. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d–f</xref>, injection of EcN stimulated higher level of cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) than the coated bacteria. Additionally, the secreted level of cytokines in mice injected with CMCB more closely approximates that of control mice treated with PBS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). It is also noteworthy that the secretion of cytokines in all mice returned to its normal level in 2 weeks (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>), verifying that embedding EcN inside a cell membrane vesicle reduced the acute side effects caused by bacteria.

To avoid immune responses associated with different blood types, the cell membrane used here for biodistribution study was extracted from BALB/C mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The liver, spleen, lung, kidney, heart, brain, and tumor tissues were collected at different time points post-injection and homogenized before spreading on LB agar plates. The quantity of bacteria present in tissues was used to estimate the biodistribution. As expected, the majority of bacteria accumulated in liver and spleen following injection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>). Encouragingly, a large number of bacteria colonized tumor sites at a short time of 1 h post-injection, showing the rapid and highly efficient accumulation of EcN in tumor tissue. In particular, the bacterial number in tumor tissues from mice injected with CMCB reached up to five times higher than the mice administrated with uncoated bacteria at 1 h post-injection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The bacterial number within healthy tissues decreased significantly and continuously with the extension of time, which in turn increased dramatically in tumor tissue in the first 5 days and then remained at a relative high level for the next 7 days (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Remarkably, the bacterial number within tumor remained at 3240 times higher than in healthy tissues even with time increased up to 12 days post-injection of coated bacteria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). The concentration of these bacteria in tumor might be ascribed to their preference for the hypoxia in the tumor tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the bacterial number within tumor from mice injected with CMCB remained at 42 times higher than mice injected with uncoated bacteria 12 days post-administration.

The colonization of EcN in liver, spleen, lung, brain, kidney, and heart from mice intravenously injected with CMCB was basically lower than that of uncoated EcN (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–f</xref>), which might be ascribed to the presence of an extra cell membrane that can decrease cellular uptake.

Here, two tumor-bearing mice models including breast cancer 4T1 and colon cancer CT26 were used for bioimaging assessments by in vivo imaging.

As visualized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>, strong luminescence signals were visualized from mice injected with luxCDABE engineered EcN.

This unique property of CMCB could be exploited for long-term bioimaging of tumors.

Living bacteria differ from conventional surface decorated nanoparticles because they are able to proliferate even though they are surface modified with various materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Consequently, CMCB may shed the coating membranes during their growth and division. We examined the stability of coating membranes by incubating CMCB in different media including 100% serum, LB medium and PBS. Flow cytometric analysis shows that almost 50% and 93% of CMCB shed the cell membranes after 0.5 h and 2 h incubation in serum, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13a, b</xref>). Interestingly, CMCB escaped from the coating cell membranes much faster when incubated in LB with only 17% remaining coated after 0.5 h incubation. We speculate the removal of coating membranes is likely attributed to the rapid division of bacteria in serum and LB. To demonstrate our hypothesis, we further tested the stability of coating membranes by incubating in ice-cold PBS and serum containing sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as the division of CMCB could be inhibited under these conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. As expected, we found that almost no change to CMCB after 24 h incubation in cold PBS, although the fraction of coated bacteria slightly decreased to 83% when the incubation time increased up to 48 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13c</xref>). Similarly, the maintenance of coating membranes was significantly prolonged when CMCB were cultured in serum containing SMX (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13d</xref>), verifying that the coating membranes were relatively stable and the removal of coating membranes was caused by division. The removal of coating membranes was also visualized by LSCM. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>, light orange represents EcN still coated with cell membranes, while the ones in red present EcN escaped from the membrane vesicles.

Schematic illustration for the removal of coating membranes is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>. These results suggest a controllable shedding process that the removal of coating membranes from CMCB can be easily tuned from hours to days by simply switching culture media, demonstrating CMCB are applicable for on-demand release or long-term application of the coated bacteria.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Analysis of bacterial decoating. <bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold> Assays for the stability of the coating membranes.

With natural cell membrane coated, bacteria exhibit (1) a low inflammatory response that leads to fewer side effects; (2) a reduced elimination by macrophages that results in higher blood reservation; (3) low accumulation in normal organs that improves colonization abilities in disease sites; and (4) almost unchanged viabilities that remains inherent bioactivities.
