To better understand potential mechanisms underlying these observations, we vaccinated influenza-naive ferrets either twice, 10 months apart (repeated vaccination group; RV), or once (current season only group; CS), using a prime-boost regimen, and then challenged the ferrets with A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2). Ferrets that received either vaccine regimen were protected against influenza disease and infection relative to naive unvaccinated ferrets, but the RV group shed more virus, especially at the peak of virus shedding 2 days post infection (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and regained weight more slowly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than those in the CS group. Qualitative, rather than quantitative, differences in the antibody response may affect protection after repeated influenza vaccination.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><title>Influenza: Repeat vaccination impairs protection</title><p id="Par2">Epidemiological evidence suggests that influenza vaccination in prior years can reduce the efficacy of influenza vaccination compared to vaccine given in the current season alone. Ian A. York and colleagues of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA investigate this phenomenon using the human relevant ferret model of influenza infection. Ferrets undergoing repeat vaccination — twice 10 months apart — show quantitatively similar antibody and cell-mediated immune responses as those given a single current-season vaccination. However, qualitatively the responses elicited by the current season vaccine alone are superior — with animals showing less dramatic loss of body weight, milder fever, reduced virus shedding and quicker recovery of lymphocyte numbers. Although less protective than current-season vaccination alone, repeated vaccination offers better protection than mock vaccination.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Influenza A viruses are common human respiratory pathogens that infect hundreds of millions of people and cause 290,000–646,000 deaths globally per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> In addition to these seasonal epidemics, novel influenza viruses that have not previously circulated among humans occasionally cross from animal reservoirs, leading to global pandemics in the naive population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Annual influenza vaccination is the primary prevention strategy against seasonal influenza. In many countries, annual influenza vaccination is recommended only for high-risk individuals, whereas in the United States it is recommended for people 6 months of age and older without contraindications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Annual vaccination has been justified because influenza viruses constantly undergo antigenic drift, requiring periodic vaccine updates, and because vaccine-induced antibody titers decline relatively rapidly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">The effectiveness of influenza vaccines can vary between subtypes and from year to year. The reasons for low vaccine effectiveness (VE) are complex and may include host factors such as age, health and immune status, as well as poor antigenic matches due to virus drift<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> or egg-adaptive changes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and poor immunogenicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> In 2017–2018, overall VE for the A(H1N1)pdm09 component of influenza vaccine was about 64%, whereas for the A(H3N2) subtype VE was about 24%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">A growing list of studies have suggested that receipt of influenza vaccine in prior years may diminish the effectiveness of the current-season’s vaccinations. The possibility that repeated influenza vaccination might reduce protective immunity, was first raised several decades ago,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> but subsequent studies were inconclusive or found that repeated vaccination was effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> However, a number of recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and some<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> but not all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> meta-analyses have also concluded that repeated vaccination may be associated with reduced VE.</p><p id="Par6">Several explanations as to why receiving influenza vaccination in 1 year might reduce its effectiveness in the following year have been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> The simplest possibility is that the effect is an artifact of study design, and reflects uncorrected confounders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> Another possibility is that, when the virus strains in the initial and the repeated vaccine are antigenically matched but the circulating virus strain is drifted, the immune response may be too focused on the vaccine strains and less effective against the challenge virus (“negative interference”, or the “antigenic distance hypothesis”).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Conversely, when the virus strains in the initial and the repeated vaccine are mismatched, the immune response to the features conserved between each may become amplified, increasing the components of the response that are less effective against the most recent viruses (“original antigenic sin hypothesis”).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> A fourth possibility is antibody sequestration, in which the antibodies induced by the initial immunization bind to subsequent vaccine antigens and prevent their exposure to the immune system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Finally, the “infection block” hypothesis suggests that by preventing highly immunogenic influenza infections, vaccination prevents individuals from gaining this mode of priming and protection before the repeated vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Of course, more than one mechanism may lead to a reduced response to repeated vaccination, whether simultaneously or in different influenza seasons.</p><p id="Par7">The ferret is considered to be the most relevant small-animal model for influenza infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Human influenza strains infect ferrets without prior adaptation, and induce disease symptoms similar to those of humans. Although the ferret model is not as well characterized as the mouse model, a number of reagents and techniques for evaluating ferret immune responses and influenza pathogenesis have been recently developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> Using ferrets enabled us to test the effect of repeated versus single vaccination on protection against influenza with fewer confounders than in humans with complex immune histories due to prior vaccination and/or infection, as well as directly testing protective efficacy by challenge. Since influenza vaccine efficacy against the A(H3N2) viruses has been relatively low in recent years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> we focused on this component of the vaccine for challenge studies. We found that ferrets receiving influenza vaccine in the current season only were more protected against challenge than were those receiving vaccine in sequential seasons, although the latter were better protected than were non-immunized ferrets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Repeated vaccination results in similar or higher serological responses as current-season vaccination</title><p id="Par8">These experiments were performed in two independent replicates using ferrets from two different suppliers, and using commercial quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV) from two different manufacturers but containing identical virus strains. Ferrets in the two experiments responded somewhat differently to immunization, although the overall picture was similar. All ferrets responded to immunization as measured by ELISA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, upper panels), although two ferrets in the CS group, in Rep 1, had ELISA titers that were at the limit of detection (titer of 100). Ferrets in the first replicate (Rep 1) achieved HI geometric mean titers (GMT) of 35.6 (RV) or 15.1 (CS) after an initial prime and two booster vaccinations (timing of immunizations is indicated with arrows on Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Ferrets in the second replicate (Rep 2) achieved GMT against egg-grown HK/4801 of 63.5 (RV) or 100.8 (CS) after a single boost. In both groups, the RV GMTs were significantly higher than those of the CS groups at the time of challenge (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref>; day 306 (Rep 1), 295 (Rep 2), or 300 (combined)).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Serological responses to HK/4801. <bold>a</bold> ELISA (left panels) and HI (right panels) assays were performed using egg-grown HK/4801 on blood samples collected from ferrets undergoing various immunization regimens.

These egg-adaptive mutations lead to a degree of antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and challenge viruses, with a minor to moderate mismatch detectable as measured by HI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, left panels) and a more marked mismatch when measured by microneutralization (MN) assays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, right panels).</p><p id="Par10">Serological responses to the A(H1N1)pdm09 component of the quadrivalent vaccines roughly paralleled those to HK/4801 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Following challenge, as expected, anti-HK/4801 titers increased to very high levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>), while the serological response to A/California/07/2009(A(H1N1)pdm09) increased by ELISA but dropped by HI (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). This is presumably since ELISA measures all antibodies that bind to HA, including those to both the highly variable HA1 region and to the much more conserved HA2 region, while HI assays measure antibodies that bind to the HA1 region that is not conserved between H3N2 and H1N1 influenza viruses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Repeated vaccination leads to less protection against influenza symptoms</title><p id="Par11">Naive ferrets challenged with wild-type, cell-grown HK/4801 developed moderate disease. They lost an average of 8% of their body weight (relative to body weight on the day of challenge), with maximum weight loss on day 7 followed by gradual recovery; even 14 days post challenge, these ferrets had lost on average about 5% of their body weight (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). They also developed the typical biphasic fever associated with influenza,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> peaking on day 2, and recurring on day 6 post challenge (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

HI and MN assays confirmed that the challenge virus was antigenically moderately different from the vaccine strain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Accordingly, it is possible that “negative interference” (the “antigenic distance hypothesis”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>) may have occurred, in which the RV group focused their antibody response on the egg-adapted vaccine strain, leading to a low response to the cell-grown challenge strain.

Notably, the ratio of ELISA to HI antibody was much higher in the RV group (51.7 or 83.6 for the RV group for egg- and cell-grown HK/4801, respectively; 18.6 or 21.1 for the CS group for egg- and cell-grown HK/4801, respectively) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
