The detection of antibodies (Ab) against FMDV structural proteins (SP) using virus neutralization test (VNT) and liquid-phase blocking ELISA (LPBE) is the standard procedure in use for monitoring seroconversion in animals post vaccination, the prevalence of infection-surveillance, proving clinical cases and seronegative status of FMDV-free/naïve-animals prior transportation. However, due to variations within SP of FMDV serotypes, each serotype-specific Ab should be detected separately which is laborious and time-consuming. Accordingly, it is crucial to develop a sensitive, rapid, and accurate test capable of detecting FMDV-specific Ab, regardless its serotype. This study describes the heterologous expression of VP2 protein in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, and its evaluation as a capture antigen in a simple indirect ELISA for serotype-independent detection of anti-FMDV Ab. Sequence analysis revealed that the VP2-coding sequence is considerably conserved among FMDV serotypes. The recombinant VP2 (rVP2), a 22 kDa polypeptide, was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography under native conditions. Immunoreactivity of the rVP2 was confirmed by using a panel of positive sera including sera from animals vaccinated with the local trivalent vaccine and guinea pig FMDV antiserum, which is routinely used as tracing/detecting Ab in LPBE testing. The results obtained from the VP2-based ELISA were comparable to those determined by VNT and LPBE standard diagnostic assays. Specificity and sensitivity of rVP2 in capturing anti-FMDV Ab were 98.3% and 100%, respectively. The developed VP2-ELISA is proved reliable and time-efficient assay for detection of FMDV seropositive animals, regardless the FMDV serotype that can be implemented in a combination with VNT and/or LPBE for rapid diagnosis of an ongoing FMDV infection.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_46596.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a severe ailment affecting livestock. There are seven antigenically and genetically divergent serotypes of the etiological agent FMD virus (FMDV): O, A, C, Asia 1, and the Southern African Territories SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. FMDV particles are made up of an icosahedral capsid each consisting of sixteen repeats of four structural proteins (SPs) VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4, encapsulating a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In addition to the structural proteins, during viral infection, a number of non-structural viral proteins (NSP) are also made in the infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">FMD has been endemic in Egypt since the 1970s with three prevalent serotypes: A, O, and SAT 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Serotype A was responsible for a critical outbreak of FMD in 2006 and serotype SAT2 caused an extensive outbreak in 2012. In our region, the possible introduction of new serotypes and sub-serotypes of FMDV by uninterrupted movement of animals across borders is a major persistent threat with substantial diverse endemic types of FMDV. Accordingly, vaccines containing these serotypes have been in use to immunize nearly all cloven-hoofed animals in Egypt. In Endemic areas, like Egypt, appropriate FMD inactivated vaccines play a key role in the control programs of FMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4"> Detection of FMDV can only be confirmed through a serological examination. The serological tests for FMDV are performed for any of these purposes: confirm suspected cases, certify individual animals prior to movement for trade, substantiate absence of infection, and demonstrate the efficacy of vaccination. The serological tests for FMDV are of two types: one detects antibodies to NSP and the other detects antibodies to SP. The SP based tests detect antibodies elicited by infection or vaccination, as in the liquid-phase blocking ELISA (LPBE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and the virus neutralization test (VNT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The SP based tests are appropriate for monitoring immunity conferred by vaccination in the field, confirming previous or ongoing infection in non-vaccinated animals, to certify animals prior to transportation (for trade purposes). However, both techniques (LPBE and VNT) use inactivated live virus that poses certain health risks and they are also time-consuming, technically challenging, and have a significant rate of false positive reactions. Therefore, novel tests that harness the recombinant DNA technology to express target proteins in eukaryotic or prokaryotic systems are under development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The FMDV structural proteins are very diverse and any change in their composition enables FMDV to escape the host immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, which complicates the detection of antibodies against each serotype. Therefore, it is crucial to have a sensitive, rapid and reproducible laboratory test capable of detecting the FMDV antibodies regardless of the serotypes.</p><p id="Par6">VP2 protein is a relatively conserved region among the FMDV serotypes; however, some substitutions in its amino acids have resulted in a significant antigenic diversity, indicating that VP2 harbors essential antigenic epitopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Therefore, the key objectives of this endeavor are to construct and express a recombinant VP2 protein to be utilized as a coating antigen in a simple local indirect ELISA for detection of antibodies against FMDV regardless of its serotype, as an alternative to inactivated FMD viral antigen for confirming previous or ongoing infection in non-vaccinated animals, to certify animals prior to movement (trade purposes), and sero-monitoring of FMDV vaccinated animals that might be functional for assessment of FMD vaccination programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of VP2 conserved antigen</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Selection and cloning</title><p id="Par8">The amino acid sequence of the FMDV VP2 capsid protein of the Egyptian SAT 2 isolate, (gb│AAZ83686) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was used as the template to determine the homogeneity between several FMDV isolates representing the seven prevalent FMDV serotypes. Based on the results, the FMDV serotypes were clustered into– Group I serotypes including SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3, Asia 1, and Type A, and Group II that included Type O. The relatedness of these serotypes is summarized in the bootstrapped neighbor-joining tree of 64 FMDV isolates as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Type C FMDV was not included in this study, since it has a consensus sequence with VP2, one can speculate the same relatedness. SAT 1, 2, 3, and type A were most similar, type O was divergent, and type Asia 1 was more closely related to SAT 1, 2, 3, and type A than to type O. The data revealed VP2-coding sequence to be highly conserved among the four FMDV capsid proteins. Furthermore, the prediction of secondary and three-dimensional (3D) structures of VP2 showed that certain motifs were highly conserved among six different FMDV types. These motifs mainly form loops connecting the β-strands and α-helices in the VP2-capsid protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Based on these findings, the VP2-coding sequence was modified and optimized to match the codon usage preference of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. This modified sequence was synthesized and cloned into the P<sup>Gex–4t1</sup> vector.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram showing the arrangement of the FMDV genome as well as the VP2 amino acids sequence.

Therefore, there is a decisive need for a reliable tool capable of monitoring seroconversion to FMDV regardless of its serotype. The aim of this study was to construct and express a recombinant structural protein (SP), i.e., VP2, which is a considerably conserved component of FMDV capsid, in a prokaryotic expression system to be utilized as a coating antigen in a simple indirect ELISA for detection of anti-FMDV antibodies (Ab) regardless of its serotype. In this study, an assay is developed for detection of antibodies against FMDV-SP in animal sera whether due to infection or vaccination. It is expected that this assay would be applicable for confirming previous or ongoing infection in non-vaccinated animals, to certify seronegative animals prior to transportation (trade purposes), and sero-monitoring of FMDV vaccinated animals. In Egypt, the open geographical boundaries, importing animals from regions with a history of FMDV diverse serotypes and the uncontrolled random backyard breeding represent a cumbersome facing FMD control programs. Consequently, animals that are not vaccinated on time remain as susceptible as foci of FMDV infection, that make it hard to follow up FMDV vaccination in such animals and to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals based on seroconversion. Recently, the Egyptian government has initiated a national wide animal numbering campaign in 2018, associated with FMDV vaccination to control this situation.</p><p id="Par17">The currently used methods, viz., LPBE and VNT, have some drawbacks such as the use of potentially dangerous inactivated live virus, laborious, time-consuming, technically challenging, and have a significant rate of false positive results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Although our developed assay is unable to distinguish diseased from vaccinated animals, it provides a serotype-independent detection of antibodies against FMDV in an ELISA format under laboratory conditions, where VNT cannot be applied as cell culture facility is not required. Therefore, the VP2-based ELISA, as a low-cost rapid pen-side test, could be utilized in a combination with other existing method like VNT and LBPE to rapidly assist diagnosis of an ongoing FMDV infection regardless its serotype.</p><p id="Par18">Previous efforts on the development of an FMDV serotype-independent detection assay reported the use of an ELISA based on the seven serotype-based polyclonal antisera for FMDV diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Further, a serotype-specific mAb-based ELISA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and a competitive ELISA using mAb specific for the 12S subunit protein from six of the seven serotypes were developed for the detection of FMDV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. DAS-ELISA based on, two mAbs with different specificities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and an assay based on mAbs produced through phage-displayed screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> were proposed for type-independent FMDV diagnosis. However, the concept in all of the aforementioned attempts was based on the antigen detection, whereas our study is the first report of developing a serotype-independent detection method for FMDV Ab in given serum samples that could be from vaccinated or infected animals.</p><p id="Par19">It has been established that the majority of the neutralizing epitopes of FMDV are localized on the VP1 capsid protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Thus it exhibits variable codons leading to VP1-based FMDV heterogeneity and emergence of new viral phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, VP1 was excluded in our approach of developing a serotype-independent FMDV detection antigen. Interestingly, immunogenic epitopes on the B-C loop of VP2 protein have been reported in the previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Some studies suggested that the N terminal region of VP2, although exposed on the viral surface, has a low antigenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, the N terminus of VP2 has been proven antigenic as it has no fixed position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and its structural flexibility exposes some of the internal domains of the capsid proteins to the surface enabling them to become definite antigenic sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In a similar vein, another report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> showed that amino acid substitutions in the VP2 subunit result in a significant antigenic diversity that leads to changes in the pathogenicity and replication ability of FMDV. Thus, even if some sites of the VP2 N-termini are not accessible by Ab, the remaining accessible sites appear to be adequate for the detection by ELISA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In addition to the antigenic properties of VP2, it has been confirmed that the N-terminal of VP2 is highly conserved among the FMDV serotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, amino acid sequence alignments of the VP2 coding sequence revealed significant homology within FMDV serotypes, which was noticeable throughout the entire ORF, not only in the N-terminus region (data not shown). The reason behind selecting the entire ORF of VP2 for expression, rather than the N-terminus region, was to ensure proper folding of rVP2, and as such to preserve its antigenic determinants. We believe that selecting only the highly conserved N- terminus region of VP2, which has approximately 26 amino acid residues, could significantly affect protein folding and ultimately lead to protein aggregation. In our previous attempts, while trying to refold short peptides expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, we faced many challenges such as protein instability and aggregation. Others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> have also reported that the production and use of short peptides and proteins for pharmaceutical use are hampered by the formation of aggregates and protein deposition in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. These data support our decision on the selection of VP2 protein to consider its antigenicity and specificity as an optional tool for FMDV serodiagnosis. In order to achieve this goal, we used the amino acid sequence of VP2 of the Egyptian local FMDV SAT 2 (gb│AAZ83686) as a model and aligned it with that of several FMDV isolates representing the seven prevalent FMDV subtypes to determine their relatedness. The sequence alignments revealed that VP2 capsid protein is highly conserved across the different FMDV subtypes. The VP2-coding sequence was then codon-optimized for its expression in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and cloned in P<sup>Gex–4t1</sup> as a fusion polypeptide with a GST tag. The VP2-GST-polypeptide (~48 kDa) was successfully expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and purified near homogeneity. After the liberation of VP2 protein from the GST, its immunoreactivity was confirmed by the western blot analysis against the FMDV antibodies found in the serum of FMDV trivalent vaccinated bovine and the guinea pig antiserum of FMDV SAT 2, which are routinely used as tracing/detecting antibodies in LPBE. Furthermore, western blot and indirect-ELISA evaluated the antigenicity of VP2 by confirming its ability for raising antibodies in mice serum. Additionally, using rVP2 protein as a coating antigen in indirect ELISA was able to capture FMDV specific antibodies in sera from FMDV-infected animals representing the three serotypes O, A, and SAT 2. Furthermore, the rVP2 based ELISA showed great sensitivity and specificity in detecting the FMD-specific antisera and the ELISA results were consistent with the VNT and LPBE with a high correlation (R ≥ 0.98). All FMDV positive sera from the infected and vaccinated calves had a mean virus neutralizing antibody (VN-Ab) titer of log<sub>10</sub> ≥ 0.9 and mean OD value ≥ 0.4. The VNT test is considered as the “gold-standard” for FDMV diagnosis and also used as a quality control measurement for evaluating ELISA. The titer and mean OD value of anti-serotype O antibody were log<sub>10</sub> 2.1 and ≥1.63, respectively, and were significantly higher (P &gt; 0.05) than those obtained for the serotypes A and SAT 2 antisera. Similarly, the titer and mean OD value of anti-FMDV antisera collected from infected calves were significantly higher (P &gt; 0.05) than those obtained from vaccinated calves. This discrepancy is likely due to the differences in the antigenicity of the different FMDV serotypes or due to the fact that the live FMDV induces faster and long-lasting immune responses than the attenuated FMDV. In order to standardize the use of VP2-protein in the indirect ELISA, the optimal antigen dilution was determined by using a checkerboard titration method. The optimal OD values were obtained with 150 ng/well of VP2 protein and 1:32 dilution of the positive sera from vaccinated animals. Furthermore, to check the applicability of the developed assay, the serum samples obtained from the clinical cases of FMD field outbreaks (<italic>n</italic> = 172) and from naïve calves vaccinated with the local inactivated polyvalent O, A, and SAT 2 oil vaccine (<italic>n</italic> = 328) were subjected to the detection by the rVP2-based ELISA. All sera from the vaccinated animals positively reacted with VP2, while 155 of the172 serum samples obtained from the clinical cases of FMD field outbreaks, showed a positive reaction.</p><p id="Par20">The previous attempts to express FMDV capsids in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> always required a tedious re-folding procedure or resulted in poor solubility of the recombinant proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, the commercially available VP1 peptide-based ELISA from United Biomedical (NY, USA) is serotype specific, besides it does not detect antibodies against the structural proteins of the FMDV serotype O in the sera from animals vaccinated with a commercial vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In order to obtain optimal quality FMDV vaccines, suitable virus strains should be chosen on the basis of serological matching. The reactivity of the sera from vaccinated calves against field isolates should be measured by VNT or LPBE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, both, VNT and LPBE, are serotype specific and a positive result will be obtained only if the field and test strains have the same serotype. Furthermore, VNT requires special bio-containment for tissue culture system and biosafety precautions, since it is carried out with live FMDV. Therefore, the indirect VP2-based ELISA could offer an alternative, to some extent, or a companion pen-side test to the VNT and LPBE. Utility of the developed VP2-based ELISA at large was partly optimized as one strain per only three FMDV serotypes was studied. In fact, we studied the local isolates/strains available in Egypt as firm legislations prohibit introduction of any overseas strains. Also, it was really impossible to take samples from the same vaccinated animals to follow up the seroconversion in a given animal. That might be resolved by a follow up work in cooperation with an international FMD laboratory.</p><p id="Par21">In summary, our study generated as the first time, a non-infectious antigen for the serotype-independent detection of FMDV antibodies using ELISA. The VP2-based ELISA has a great potential for adaptation to a rapid pen-side test, complementary to VNT and/or LPBE that can be carried out on-farm or at animal quarantines. This would reduce the use of inactivated FMDV antigen in diagnostic assays, which will also decrease the biosecurity risks and extend geographical acceptability of reagents for the assay. The recombinant VP2 capsid protein, which is a considerably conserved structural protein across FMDV serotypes, is found suitable ELISA coating antigen for serotype-independent rapid screening of sera from both infected and vaccinated animals. That might be of great value in quality control evaluation of polyvalent inactivated vaccines by rapid checking of animals prior to and after vaccination. Furthermore, its use will significantly lessen the time and expenses encountered for detection of seroconversion against different FMDV serotypes as well as to avoid the risky use of live viruses. Moreover, it highlights the utility of FMDV VP2-based ELISA for detecting FMDV Ab in sera from experimentally infected and vaccinated animals regardless the FMDV serotype, which would be helpful in confirming previous or ongoing infection in a non-vaccinated herd or population and to certify animals prior to movement for trade purposes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Viruses, cells, and cultures</title><p id="Par22">Egyptian local isolates of FMDV serotypes O (Manisa), A (Egy/2006), and SAT 2 (Egy/2012) were propagated in an appropriate bio-containment level at the quality control laboratory (QCL), Veterinary Sera and Vaccines Research Institute (VSVRI), Abbassia, Cairo, Egypt.

Briefly, a 96-well ELISA plate (Nunc, Denmark) was coated with 50 ng/well of rVP2 protein diluted in carbonate and bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 at 4 °C/overnight. The wells were washed with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) containing 0.01% Tween, then bovine serum albumin (BSA) (3%) was used to block the free residual-spaces. The wells were washed twice with PBST; serum collected before each booster was diluted in PBS (1:3000) and added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature (RT). The zero-day mice sera (prior to the first mice-immunizations) were collected and used as negative controls for this assay. The wells were intensively-washed with PBST. The rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Aldrich) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was added at a dilution of 1:20000 and incubated for 2 h at RT. The excess and unbound conjugated antibodies were removed by washing with phosphate buffer saline-Tween (PBST) and the reaction was developed by 100 μL of p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate (PNPP)-substrate solution.
