Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CMV reactivation in sepsis progression. The overall occurrence of cytomegalovirus reactivation in the cohort was 17.58%. Was observed an increase in plasma levels of NO, reduction of percentage of free days of mechanical ventilation and arterial pH, as well as changes in coagulation parameters in the reactivated group. There was also a significant increase in IL-10, creatinine, urea levels and reduction of 24-hour urine output. These variables still correlated with viral load, demonstrating an association between the reactivation process and kidney failure present in sepsis. The reactivated group still had 2.1 times the risk of developing septic shock and an increase in the mortality rates. CMV is reactivated in sepsis and these patients presented a higher risk of developing septic shock and higher mortality rates and our data suggest that IL-10 and NO may be involved in this process.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_45390.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Sepsis is a pathological syndrome with biochemical abnormalities induced by infection. It is defined as an organic dysfunction with imminent threat to life triggered by a deregulated host response to an infection. It persists among the most serious worldwide public health issues with a growing incidence over the years. It is characterized by a heterogeneous host response to a pathogen amplified by several endogenous factors, leading to alterations in several physiological processes, such as cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, metabolic, and coagulation. This broad perspective of changes define the biological significance and clinical heterogeneity of the affected individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that can be transmitted by various bodily secretions and fluids, such as saliva, sexual contact, blood transfusion, and transplantation of solid organs or bone marrow. Primary infection in immunocompetent individuals is generally asymptomatic and may result in a latent long-term infection condition is established, which may be reactivated in certain situations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">CMV reactivation is an important aspect related to the pathogenesis of this viral infection. Immunosuppression, inflammation, infection and oxidative stress are important risk factors that may trigger reactivation. The exact mechanism required is yet to be fully elucidated, but studies have suggested the role of TNF-α as an important mediator to this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The CMV reactivation has been widely associated with bacterial sepsis and is likely to result from the inflammatory process which is peculiar to such a condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Reactivation occurs in approximately 30% of individuals with sepsis without immunosuppression and is associated with a longer stay in ICU patients, greater need for mechanical ventilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and over 80% increase in the mortality rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In addition, CMV reactivation in patients with sepsis has been described as a worsening factor for clinical prognosis, with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality, directly associated with severe organ dysfunction and hemodynamic imbalance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

However, few studies have evaluated the biochemical and immunological variables associated the with viral reactivation which that may influence prognosis and clinical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Our study demonstrated that CMV reactivation changes a variety of laboratory parameters that promote a more intensive decompensation than in patients with sepsis without reactivation, in addition to worsening the general clinical condition evaluated through increased SOFA score and lower consciousness level according to the Glasgow coma scale.</p><p id="Par16">Since we found few studies evaluating cytokines and inflammatory mediators within this sepsis/CMV context. As already described, cytomegalovirus is capable of alters a range of cytokines, so we investigated which could be the most feasible to be measured in our study to investigate how CMV immunomodulation would interfere with sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. So we chose to measure some of the major cytokines of Th1, Th2, and Th17 response patterns, as well as NO.</p><p id="Par17">Our data show an increase in NO and IL-10 levels during CMV reactivation in sepsis, corroborating with several studies pointing out that CMV infection is able to stimulate NO production in several cell types, but such mediator does not act as a microbicidal molecule on this virus. Zhu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> demonstrated the role of nitric oxide in the escape of the immune system by differentiating hematopoietic progenitor cells into a subtype of long-lived monocytes that produce IL-10, and act as viral reservoir and potent immunosuppressant.</p><p id="Par18">CMV is able to stimulate the expression of excessive NO amounts in the lungs through bronchial epithelial cells, which results in cytotoxicity and injury of adjacent tissue, inducing pneumonitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, high NO levels observed during reactivation in patients in our study could be implicated in increased respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation. Alveolar injury could reduce gas diffusion as well as induce an acid-base imbalance for increase of arterial pCO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in an acidotic state.</p><p id="Par19">The reactivated group had a higher prevalence of septic shock than the control group, suggesting a role of CMV-mediated NO in sepsis severity. CMV has proved to activate NAD(P)H oxidase from arterial smooth muscle cells and deregulate the eNOS expression in endothelial cells, thus contributing to arteriolar vasodilation. In addition, CMV can stimulate venous inflammation and thrombogenic responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, CMV may be related to the circulatory abnormalities of septic shock; however, further studies are required to elucidate mechanisms possibly involved in this process.</p><p id="Par20">Our study found a considerable decrease in total platelet count and hematocrit percentage, in addition to higher APTT only for the reactivated group. CMV is capable to directly interact and activate platelets through TLR-2 binding, inducing P-selectin expression and the formation of aggregates between platelets and leukocytes via CD169, which stimulates the expression of pro-angiogenic cytokines involved in higher vascular permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Hemodynamic disturbances in sepsis may range from a simple subclinical change in blood coagulation to a severe disseminated intravascular coagulation (ICD), characterized by the formation of microthrombi in vessels that contribute significantly to the dysfunction of various organs and consequent consumption of platelets and coagulation factors that may contribute to hemorrhagic manifestations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This context suggests that CMV may be able to contribute to the thrombogenic events of sepsis through the direct interaction of platelets and extrinsic pathway activation of blood coagulation due to endothelial damage. Additionally, higher CRP levels also indicate exacerbated inflammatory response to the reactivation process.</p><p id="Par22">IL-10 levels for the reactivated groups were significantly higher and had direct correlation with creatine and urea levels and also a indirect correlation with 24UO. In addition, these variables also showed a correlation with the CMV viral load, with exception of urea.</p><p id="Par23">IL-10 is a key component of the immune system that regulates and suppresses the expression of proinflammatory cytokines during the recovery phases of infections consequently softening the damage caused by inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The IL-10 family comprises a set of nine human cytokines and four viral homologs, including one synthesized by the CMV. The cmvIL-10 is secreted by infected cells and binds to cellular IL-10 receptors similarly to the natural ligand, leading to inflammation suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">In addition, CMV is still capable to induce IL-10 expression by virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells upon recognizing MHC-II exhibiting viral antigens. These mechanisms could induce immunosuppression and regulate the inflammatory response, contributing to immune system escape, resistance, and maintenance of CMV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">Among the diversity of IL-10 functions, this cytokine plays an important role in renal physiology for being related to the development of acute renal diseases and progression to chronic failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The major producers of IL-10 in the kidneys are the mesangial cells, whose abnormal proliferation structurally alters the glomeruli and interstitial tubules and may result in renal failure. IL-10 is a mesangial growth factor with important autocrine activity, promoting cell proliferation. <italic>In vivo</italic> administration of IL-10 in normal rats resulted in considerably higher number of intraglomerular cells and consequent reduction in creatinine clearance. In addition, IL-10 further promotes the deposition of immune complexes that contribute to glomerular injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, increased IL-10 in patients of the reactivated group may somehow play a role in renal failure in sepsis.</p><p id="Par26">In fact, patients with lower viral load had lower levels of IL-10 and the lower levels of IL-10 in the reactivated group were similar to the median of the non-reactivated group, that is, the levels presented by patients with lowest viral burdens were probably due to sepsis alone and not due to the reactivation process.</p><p id="Par27">Bah <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, demonstrated in murine model the time in days for IL-10 production in sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture, and in fact, IL-10 levels were time dependent, with lower levels in the first days after onset of sepsis and Avdic <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> demonstrated the ability of homologous IL-10 produced by cytomegalovirus (cmvIL-10) to immunomodulate and significantly increase the synthesis of human IL-10 (hIL-10) in myeloid cells. The ability of cmvIL-10 to induce the synthesis of hIL-10 was dose dependent, however at lower concentrations this phenomenon was not observed. Thus, it is logical to assume that the higher the viral load, the higher the level of circulating cmvIL-10 and hIL-10 due to this cascade effect and perhaps a low viral load with low cmvIL-10 is not sufficiently capable of triggering this phenomenon or at least in a large-scale, perhaps because of this IL-10 levels in these patients remained similar to the non-reactivated group.</p><p id="Par28">As well as cytomegalovirus, other viruses that have the ability to remain latent may be reactivated in sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Although we did not perform the detection of other pathogens, in our study we demonstrated that the levels of IL-10, creatinine, and 24 h urine output showed a correlation with CMV viral load, which allows us to infer that there is indeed an association and that is with cytomegalovirus and probably not with any other pathogen.</p><p id="Par29">Sepsis is assumed to progress from a primary hyperinflammatory at an early stage to a predominantly immunosuppressive state, with extreme production of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators responsible for a state of immunological dissonance account for refractory shock, multiple organ failure and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">The overall occurrence of cytomegalovirus reactivation in the cohort ranged 17.58% and the patients had worsening of organ dysfunction, with a 2.1-fold higher risk of developing septic shock, and 2.5-fold higher mortality risk in relation to the group without reactivation within 28 days, in addition to a 33.4% times greater need for mechanical ventilation. In this context, our data suggest an influence of CMV reactivation on the clinical outcome of these patients.</p><p id="Par31">Sepsis may indeed be a trigger factor for cytomegalovirus reactivation that may contribute to worst clinical outcome in these patients, but is not a unique factor, they are two independent phenomena that might have an association, but also have their individualities and factors unrelated to each other that may be involved and contribute to the process. Septic shock may be an event facilitated by cytomegalovirus, since the reactivated group showed a higher prevalence, but is not an exclusive trigger because the non-reactivated group also presented septic shock, but with lower prevalence. It is clear that the low number of individuals in the reactivated group may lead to a sample bias, so we firmly believe that further studies are needed to evaluate this association and to find out if there is a cause and effect relationship.</p><p id="Par32">We demonstrated that CMV is reactivated in sepsis as well as these patients presented a higher risk of developing septic shock and higher mortality rates, especially along the first weeks after reactivation, and our data suggest that IL-10 and NO may be involved in this process. The development kidney failure, respiratory and cardiovascular alterations, as well as changes in the coagulation system and exacerbation of the inflammatory profile, can indicate the possible fields of how CMV reactivation influences the prognosis and clinical outcome of patients with sepsis. Therefore, the development of a better understanding on CMV reactivation in sepsis and possible new strategies to prevent it may contribute significantly to the clinical outcome of these patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Subjects and design</title><p id="Par33">This is a cohort study conducted at the Hospital Universitario de Londrina, Brazil, between May and October 2017.
