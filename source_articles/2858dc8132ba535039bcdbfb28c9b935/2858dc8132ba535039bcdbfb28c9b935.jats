However, small animal models are not sufficient to evaluate large-sized products for human use. Thus, an immunodeficient large animal model is necessary in order to properly evaluate the clinical efficacy of human-derived tissue-engineered products, such as artificial grafts. Here we report the development of an immunodeficient pig model, the operational immunodeficient pig (OIDP), by surgically removing the thymus and spleen, and creating a controlled immunosuppressive protocol using a combination of drugs commonly used in the clinical setting. We find that this model allows the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts. The development of the OIDP is an essential step towards a comprehensive and clinically relevant evaluation of human cell regeneration strategies at the preclinical stage.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">The development of tissue-engineered vascular grafts heavily relies on the availability of large animal models that allow long-term assessment of graft patency.

powerful immunosuppressive agents were developed in the 1980s, the results of organ transplantation in humans have dramatically improved, resulting in an increased need for organs for transplantation. On the other hand, under the current situation of a worldwide donor organ shortage, the production of human organs has become an important objective of regenerative medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In recent years, there have been remarkable developments in stem cell technology and tissue engineering technology such as induced pluripotent stem cells. Meanwhile, three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology has also been developed, which allows for the construction of any 3D structure using cells alone, without scaffold materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and we successfully developed the human original 3D bioprinted tube (HOBPT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> using our original 3D bioprinting system. Although this system has enabled the production of organs that can be implanted into small animals, such as vascular grafts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, substitute nerves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and myocardium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> using human-derived cells, the development of large animal models to be used for preclinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the implantation of human organs produced using this technology is currently underway.</p><p id="Par4">Mini-pigs are superior in terms of their reproductive capacity as multiple pregnancies are possible. Furthermore, they are well-tempered and easy to handle. Moreover, they are similar to humans in terms of their anatomy, physiology, immune system, and lifespan. Given these advantages, the mini-pig immunodeficiency model is expected to be a sufficient large animal model enabling evaluation after the transplantation of human stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Combination immunosuppressive therapy, which was established based on the use of immunosuppressive therapy in clinical practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, has also been administered to mature mini-pigs for preclinical studies after human-derived cell transplantation. However, it is generally impossible to control immunosuppression over several months owing to a strong immune response against human cells or tissues. A severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) pig model was developed using genetic modification technology; however, unlike SCID mice, long-term feeding was found to be difficult even under sterile conditions, which represented a major problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, although T-cell immunodeficiency can be induced by neonatal total thymectomy in rodents, we have already proved that neonatal total thymectomy alone was not sufficient for inducing complete immunodeficiency in pigs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In the present study, we evaluate the long-term results and immunosuppressive effects after xenografting the HOBPT as a neck arteriovenous shunt graft in our original operational immunodeficient pig (OIDP) model, created by removing the major immune organs and the controlled administration of combination immunosuppressive therapy under careful monitoring. We then compare the results to those in a conventional immunosuppressive pig (CISP) model in which immunosuppression is controlled by combination immunosuppressive therapy alone. Our OIDP model demonstrates the long-term accommodation of the HOBPT, whereas CISP model suffers from severe rejection. The development of OIDPs without the rejection of human cell-derived organs symbolizes an essential step toward the comprehensive evaluation of preclinical cell regeneration strategies and contributes to the development of regenerative medicine using human organs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Development of the OIDP model</title><p id="Par6">Six Göttingen mini-pigs (male; age, 6–7 months; weight ≥ 15 kg; Ina MP Production Center, Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd.) were anesthetized with 0.5–1.5% isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. A midline incision was made on the ventral region of the neck, and three lobes of the thymus (the left and right cervical lobes and the thoracic lobe) were excised. Subsequently, laparotomy was performed by making an incision in the middle of the abdomen to remove the spleen. At the same time, the upper portion of the stomach was exposed with the insertion of a catheter (16 F, JMS hydrophilic Foley catheter, JMS), after which the stomach and catheter insertion site was ligated and fixed at the upper portion of the stomach to prevent contact with the ground to avoid abscess formation around the gastrostomy. One end of the catheter was exposed to the median line of the back through the skin on the right side and sutured and fixed to the skin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Tacrolimus hydrate (0.5 mg/kg/day), mycophenolate mofetil (60 mg/kg/day), and prednisolone (20 mg/body/day) were administered through the gastric tube from the day after removal of the major immune organs. An HOBPT was transplanted at 1 week after the removal of the major immune organs and the blood tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid concentrations were measured (measurement location: SRL, Inc.). The dose was adjusted so that the trough levels of tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid in the blood were 10–20 ng/mL and 2–6 μg/mL, respectively. Ampicillin sodium (1 g/5 mL/body) and buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.01 mg/kg; liquid quantity 0.05 mL/kg) were intramuscularly administered for 3 days from the date of transplantation. The blood concentrations of tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid tended to fluctuate according to dosage. There were no deaths or serious complications, including infection, liver, or renal dysfunction during the months after transplantation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM9">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Thymectomy, splenectomy, and gastrostomy of a mini-pig.

The patency was maintained for 3 months in two of six pigs in the OIDP group. There were fewer lymphocytes infiltrating into the HOBPT at 3 months after transplantation than at 1 month post surgery. Given that the histology of HOBPT at 3 months after transplantation showed that host-derived smooth muscle cells had extensively migrated into the HOBPT wall (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a–c, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a–c</xref>), the inflammatory phase seems to have shifted to the remodeling or fibrosing phase.</p><p id="Par18">It should be noted that this is the first report in which tissue-engineered grafts derived from human cells remained patent for &gt; 1 month after xenotransplantation in a large animal model.

These results demonstrate the severity of acute rejection, as reported in previous studies of xenotransplantation of tissue-engineered grafts derived from human cells under triple drug immunosuppression therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Our data of peripheral blood leukocytes and serum immunoglobulin after HOBPT implantation indicate the histological differences in the inflammatory reaction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>, b) between the two groups and suggest that controlling systemic circulating inflammatory cells and antibodies is important for ensuring graft patency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">Examining the morphological changes in the graft after transplantation is also important when evaluating ongoing graft rejection. The graft dilates owing to the pressure and volume load experienced under a physiological environment, so we evaluated the morphology of the HOBPTs by an ultrasonic examination (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). We assumed that the acute wall thickening of the HOBPTs in CISP was owing to acute rejection, whereas the gradual wall thickening in OIDP was owing to the pressure and volume load because it was similar to the physiological response of native vessels in the arteriovenous shunt environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">Immunodeficient mice can be created by genetic recombination technology and several studies have been conducted, not only for drug discovery but also for preclinical studies of new drugs, basic research differentiation and the functional analysis of human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, the findings from studies of transplantation of clinical relevant organs prepared from human cells are not necessarily applicable to humans, owing to differences in size, lifespan, the number of cells, and the duration for preparation, along with the observation period after transplantation. In this context, an immunodeficient large animal model is required to evaluate medical bio-material products for human use. However, among SCID pigs, 45% of fetuses are stillborn, with most of the survivors being difficult to manage, and dying on the 70th day of life, even under sterile conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, the costs and time associated with producing SCID pigs are enormous. To overcome these limitations, it was necessary to develop another type of immunodeficient pig model. It has been reported that the immunosuppressive effect thymectomy alone is insufficient for inducing immunosuppression in young piglets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, we removed the thymus and the spleen, which are the major immunological organs, and simultaneously carried out gastrostomy in order to enable the administration of the immunosuppressive agents, regardless of dietary intake. It should be emphasized that we made the gastrostomy in a higher position of the stomach to avoid abscess formation around the gastrostomy because we had already confirmed that gastrostomy at a lower position of the abdomen (nearer to the ground) was easily and severely infected in quadruped pigs in an immunosuppressive state. With the use of our controlled immunosuppressive therapy via a higher positioned gastrostomy, we could sufficiently control immunization as well as infection by the administration of general antibiotics in the acute phase after transplantation, without breeding in special sterile conditions such as a specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment. The cost of maintaining a SPF environment for a long time is substantial. Therefore, the fact that OIDP animals do not require SPF management is a great advantage in terms of their management, as well as the cost and time associated with the manufacture of SCID pigs. Another major advantage of the OIDP model is the fact that this model can be universally adapted to “maturation” pigs by adjusting the amount of immunosuppressant according to the type of pig. Because the age of the pig is also one important factor influencing the response for the verification of human-derived cell products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">This study clearly demonstrated the usefulness of OIDP as well as the excellent outcome of our 3D bioprinting technology in the development of small-diameter artificial blood vessels. Existing small-diameter ( &lt; 6 mm) artificial blood vessels made of foreign substances such as PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) have many problems that remain to be solved, including—but not limited to—anti-thrombogenicity, anti-infectivity, and biocompatibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In recent years, there have been reports on the development of small-diameter artificial blood vessels using tissue engineering techniques with different approaches, including artificial blood vessels using biodegradable polymers as scaffolds or artificial blood vessels made of decellularized vascular tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. On the other hand, 3D bioprinting technology developed by Nakayama et al. has many advantages because small-diameter artificial blood vessels of various sizes can be prepared using autologous cells alone, without any scaffolding material, which is a foreign substance. As the ultimate goal of our study is the clinical application of this vascular structure, it is necessary to use all materials, including the medium, according to the regulatory guidelines of biological products for human use. Porcine cell-derived constructs made with these media were unable to attain the desired strength because the types of products that meet such criteria are not available on the market. Thus, the development of our OIDP model is crucial for the comprehensive evaluation of human original products at the preclinical stage.</p><p id="Par22">Although HOBPTs were originally only produced from human skin-derived fibroblasts, a post-transplantation histopathological examination in the OIDP group revealed replacement with several mini-pig derived cells in the grafts, including vascular endothelial cells (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), vascular smooth muscle cells (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, f, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c, f</xref>), and extracellular matrix, including elastic fibers (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>i, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i</xref>). These results strongly indicate the self-organizing phenomenon as a living blood vessel derived from a recipient (mini-pig) after transplantation and that long-term accommodation may be achieved through this form of “adjustable” inflammation-induced regeneration. These self-organizing phenomena induced by the interaction and migration of host-derived cells constituting the original vital blood vessels might continuously improve the physiological function of HOBPTs over the long-term because the physiological function as well as anti-thrombogenicity of the original vital blood vessels may be maintained and continue to accommodate the HOBPT to the original blood vessels. If this HOBPT becomes clinically available, its application can be expected not only as artificial blood vessels for dialysis access, which are problematic owing to puncture site infection and thrombus trouble, but also as an alternative small-diameter artificial blood vessel substitute for autologous vein grafts with potential applications in coronary artery bypass surgery or bypass surgery at the distal lower extremities.</p><p id="Par23">By surgically removing the major immune organs and implementing controlled therapeutic strategies with combination immunosuppression, we successfully induced an immunodeficient state in mini-pigs to enable the long-term accommodation of an HOBPT.
