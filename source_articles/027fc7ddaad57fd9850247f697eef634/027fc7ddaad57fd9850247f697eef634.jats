Combining bioinformatics with RNA and protein analysis, we identified downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the hippocampus of adult DS individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and the ‘Tc1’ DS mouse model. Providing a potential underlying molecular pathway, we demonstrate that the chromosome 21 kinase DYRK1A regulates Wnt signalling via a novel bimodal mechanism. Under basal conditions, DYRK1A is a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin. Following pathway activation, however, DYRK1A exerts the opposite effect, increasing signalling activity. In summary, we identified downregulation of hippocampal Wnt/β-catenin signalling in DS, possibly mediated by a dose dependent effect of the chromosome 21-encoded kinase DYRK1A. Overall, we propose that dosage imbalance of the Hsa21 gene <italic>DYRK1A</italic> affects downstream Wnt target genes. Therefore, modulation of Wnt signalling may open unexplored avenues for DS and Alzheimer’s disease treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>RCUK | Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">FC001194</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">U117527252</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">G0601056</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">G0601056</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">MR/M00676X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tybulewicz</surname><given-names>Victor L.

It is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21) and is associated with several distinctive characteristics, including intellectual disability and neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. DS phenotypes likely arise from gene dosage effects resulting from the additional chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, the key cellular mechanisms underlying pathology are poorly understood. Identification of target molecular pathways contributing to the disease is urgently needed to develop effective therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated dysfunction of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling in DS. The Wnt signalling pathway is a highly conserved signal transduction cascade with high activity during development but of key importance in adulthood as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Activation of the pathway is dependent upon nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which drives expression of several target genes. Canonical Wnt signalling plays fundamental, well-described roles in several biological processes, including development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, adult nervous system function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, stem cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">DS has long been associated with a high incidence of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD-DS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. On the other hand, recent evidence has consistently implicated defects in canonical Wnt signalling in the pathogenesis of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Here, we identified substantial Wnt signalling downregulation in the hippocampus of DS individuals with AD pathology and the Tc1 mouse model of DS. This suggests the presence of a novel functional relationship between DS and Wnt signalling, which may contribute to the development of AD in the ageing DS population. We further characterised such relationship via a candidate gene approach. Wnt dysregulation in DS, in fact, might arise from increased expression of key Hsa21-encoded proteins such as DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A). In support of this hypothesis, we present evidence of novel bimodal regulatory effects of DYRK1A overexpression, kinase inhibition and interaction with other Wnt signalling components. The kinase DYRK1A has a multitude of substrates regulating developmental, neuronal and neurodegenerative cell signalling mechanisms, and functionally interacts with the primary Wnt components GSK3β and p120/δ-catenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. DYRK1A is thought to be an essential mediator of intellectual disability in DS, and has also been proposed to contribute to DS/AD pathogenesis as well as idiopathic AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Wnt signalling is downregulated in human AD-DS</title><p id="Par4">We first sought to determine whether canonical Wnt signalling alterations are present in the human DS hippocampus.

Upon 24-hour DVL1 overexpression, (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>, right, red) DVL1 displayed a distinctive vesicle-like distribution, currently ascribed to liquid-liquid phase transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.

This key developmental pathway is well placed to underlie many of the wide-ranging features of DS, and particularly the neurodegeneration found in AD-DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Our data adds further evidence that the DS transcriptome is deregulated beyond Hsa21 genes (Figs <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> and supports recent findings of overall cell signalling defects in DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. We hereby propose that dysfunction of the Wnt signal transduction pathway contributes to DS phenotypes. Chronic Wnt dysregulation, due to overexpression of modulators on Hsa21, in particular <italic>DYRK1A</italic>, may effectively extend the dosage imbalance effects of one gene to a high number of secondary target genes.</p><p id="Par21">This conclusion is supported by our combined genetic and biochemical analyses of human DS and Tc1 mouse hippocampal samples (Figs <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>–<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Wnt signalling activity was consistently downregulated in the hippocampus of Tc1 mice and human DS individuals. In the former, downregulation of Wnt signalling was suggested by transcriptional profiles as well as reduced active β-catenin protein levels. Given the premature onset of AD dementia in human DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, whereby pathology manifests as early as the third decade of life, initial Wnt investigation in the Tc1 model focused on young adult mice. Our findings thus suggest that hippocampal Wnt signalling reduction may represent an early pathological process, potentially underlying the premature development of AD in human DS. It would nevertheless be of interest to determine whether, in the Tc1 mouse, similar changes might also be present at a later time point, as already observed in human DS hippocampi. This should be addressed in future studies.</p><p id="Par22">Indeed, current knowledge of Wnt signalling in neuronal function indicates that downregulation of the pathway is likely to contribute to neurodegenerative processes, especially during adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Further reflecting underlying abnormalities in Wnt signalling, we detected changes in DKK3 levels in Tc1 and human DS hippocampi. DKK3 is a member of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf family, which is involved in hippocampal development and AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. Consistent with our data, DKK3 is reportedly elevated in CSF and plasma of sporadic AD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. It is presently unclear why the DKK3 alterations differ between the Tc1 mouse and humans. This is possibly due to late-stage overall dysfunction of the Wnt secretory machinery in AD-DS, and further investigation is required.</p><p id="Par23">We suspect, however, that Wnt signalling might not necessarily be ubiquitously downregulated in DS. The complexity of Wnt function in development, health and disease generally supports the possibility of multi-directional alterations in DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, although this remains to be determined. By contrast, mice with duplicated Hsa21 syntenic regions on Mmu10 or 17 presented no overall effect on active β-catenin (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). Therefore, we assumed that the overexpression of genes located on the Hsa21 syntenic region on Mmu16 affects canonical Wnt signalling in the hippocampus. This led to our hypothesis of DYRK1A as a candidate Wnt modulator in DS, given its known functional interaction with Wnt components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and important contribution to DS and AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">DYRK1A was able to regulate total and pSer9 GSK3β levels in SH-SY5Y cells, leading to Wnt signal inhibition under basal conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). This is perhaps not surprising, given the known priming relationship between the two kinases. Evidence suggests DYRK1A may employ priming phosphorylation to target substrates for further modification by GSK3β and subsequent degradation, independently of Wnt function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. A similar mechanism might however allow DYRK1A to direct GSK3β phosphorylation to Wnt signalling components. The presence of several DYRK1A interactions with Wnt-associated proteins, most importantly DVL1 and DKK3 (Figs <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>) suggests multiple access routes for DYRK1A modulation of the Wnt pathway. It is particularly interesting that DKK3, which we found to be altered in the DS hippocampus, interacts with DYRK1A via its nuclear speckle-localising sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. This suggests potential regulation of DYRK1A localisation by DKK3, a possibility which warrants further study. The bimodal effects of DYRK1A on Wnt signalling activity support its modulatory role further (Figs <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A–E</xref>, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Overall, DYRK1A enhanced active Wnt signalling while reducing basal activity levels. Consistently with this idea, we showed subcellular re-localisation of DYRK1A from the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> to the cytoplasm upon Wnt signalling activation (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). This suggests that bimodal Wnt regulation by DYRK1A may be dependent upon its subcellular distribution and resulting substrate preference. Nuclear DYRK1A may thus suppress basal Wnt signalling activation by a transcriptional process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. By contrast cytoplasmic DYRK1A, possibly working in synergy with its interaction partner DVL1, increases active Wnt signalling further. This novel Wnt enhancing property of DYRK1A is supported by recent findings in pancreatic β-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. It is possible that these novel properties of DYRK1A may account for, or at least contribute to, the beneficial effects of Lithium treatment in the Ts65Dn DS mouse model reported by Contestabile <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. The notion of a functional Wnt-DYRK1A relationship is also supported by our preliminary identification of a physical interaction of this kinase with DKK3 (Figs <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), which might occur intracellularly at the plasma membrane (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Whilst we do acknowledge that DKK Wnt antagonists are mostly known as secreted proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>, evidence exists suggesting DKK3 might also possess intracellular functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. Thus we preliminary propose that, DKK3 might further contribute to bimodal Wnt-DYRK1A modulation by interacting with the latter kinase at the cell membrane.</p><p id="Par25">The consequence of this dualistic effect in DS might be a complex spatiotemporal alteration in Wnt target gene expression throughout life (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Given that the default level of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> expression is chronically elevated in this condition, Wnt signalling might be proportionally affected as a consequence, in a direction determined by local activation states. This implies that tissue types with low basal Wnt signalling levels, such as adult hippocampal neurons, may suffer from further downregulation, as observed in Tc1 mice and DS individuals. Indeed, under-activation of Wnt signalling in the adult hippocampus results in synaptic loss and neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup> and is expected to disrupt key mechanisms such as neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup> and long-term potentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>. Conversely, rapidly proliferating tissues such as fibroblasts may undergo aberrant Wnt over-activation. It is well established that enhanced Wnt activity significantly correlates with development of several cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>. Thus, Wnt dysfunction might potentially contribute to the known differential cancer susceptibility in DS, such as the enhanced risk of leukemias and reduced incidence of solid tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>. High basal Wnt levels in proliferative haematopoietic cells might, for example, be exacerbated by <italic>DYRK1A</italic> overexpression, which does indeed play a role in DS-related leukemias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup>. This intriguing possibility, however, remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par26">Overall, the key implication of our findings is that Wnt signalling regulation by DYRK1A may be established as a novel target for therapeutic development in DS neuropathology and beyond. Such a strategy might entail a dual approach: (1) Targeting aberrant DYRK1A activity in particularly Wnt-susceptible tissue types such as the adult hippocampus. (2) Directly targeting under/over-activation of Wnt signalling and target genes, depending on tissue-specific directional changes. Both approaches are particularly attractive, chiefly because Wnt signalling and DYRK1A have been heavily investigated therapeutically. In the context of cancer, a high number of pharmaceutical agents which target Wnt signalling on multiple levels already exists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup>.

Similarly, employment of DYRK1A inhibitors to target cognitive deficits in DS and β-cell dysfunction in diabetes is a rapidly developing field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup>. A variety of therapeutic strategies can be envisioned at multiple developmental stages. Administration of a combined Wnt-DYRK1A normalising therapy <italic>in utero</italic> might prove critical in tackling developmental abnormalities in DS. Likewise, Wnt signalling stimulation may be beneficial in later life, especially in the context of AD-DS. Thus, eventual clinical translation of our findings might open avenues for treatment strategies in DS, aimed at normalising Wnt signalling function throughout life. We hope that future research efforts will expand on our proposed model, in order to tackle this condition and improve the quality of life for those affected by it.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study design</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par27">Selected based on sample/tissue availability following standard procedures for each technique, in order to generate statistically significant results, see relevant sections of materials and methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par28">All data collected for each experiment presented were included.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outliers</title><p id="Par29">No outliers were excluded, all data are presented as box plots including minimum and maximum values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Replicates</title><p id="Par30">For all mouse and human DS immunoblotting experiments, samples were quantified in duplicate and averaged, reported <italic>n</italic> for these experiments represent averaged duplicates.

Secondly, a global score takes into account the interactions found in all the screens performed at Hybrigenics using the same library. This global score represents the probability of an interaction being nonspecific. For practical use, the scores were divided into four categories, from A (highest confidence) to D (lowest confidence). A fifth category (E) specifically flags interactions involving highly connected prey domains previously found several times in screens performed on libraries derived from the same organism.
