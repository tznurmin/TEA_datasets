However, despite the importance of the Hmong pharmacopeia as a primary health care resource, no study has been undertaken to thoroughly document medicinal plant knowledge and its transmission. Objectives of this study are (i) to describe and characterize Hmong pharmacopeia, and (ii) to understand how medicinal plant knowledge is transmitted and spread among Hmong in Lao PDR, in order to assess whether this knowledge base is under threat.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In order to describe Hmong pharmacopeia, a total of 14 interlocutors were interviewed in three provinces (Bokeo, Xieng Khouang, and Vientiane), using “walk in the wood” methodology. To gain insight about knowledge transmission, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 people. Twenty of them were herbalists. Data analysis was performed using univariate analysis for the description of the pharmacopeia. Medicinal plant knowledge consistency was assessed through use and plant name overlapping. Answers to the semi-structured interview on knowledge transmission were analyzed qualitatively.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Three hundred thirty-three different medicinal species were collected. The majority of uses attributed to plants were gastrointestinal conditions (22% of total use reports), gynecological conditions and sexually transmitted disease (12%), skin affections (8%), kidney and bladder problems (5%), physical traumas (5%), and aphrodisiac (or male tonics; 5%). Use convergences are more marked in the gynecological sphere, but there is a strong heterogeneity in practices and knowledge. Medicinal plant knowledge transmission is oral, gained from direct experience since childhood, matrilineal, and kept strictly within the family lineage. Apparent limited consensus on uses might stem from the method of knowledge transmission and to the economic value given to medicinal plants.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">Use pattern of species from the Hmong pharmacopeia does not appear to be strikingly different from the national Lao pharmacopeia. Differences may lie in the methods and reasons for knowledge transmission. It can be proposed that the economic value given to plants helps in keeping the knowledge alive, and encourages its transmission.</p></sec><sec id="ASec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par5">Hmong traditional medicine is constantly evolving in a dynamic process and aims to respond to health problems faced by the local population. Herbalists appear as health fully fledged actors and should be recognized and valued as such.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hmong</kwd><kwd>Medicinal plant</kwd><kwd>Lao PDR</kwd><kwd>Pharmacopeia</kwd><kwd>Traditional medicine</kwd><kwd>TEK</kwd><kwd>Knowledge transmission</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13002_2019_Article_307.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine &amp; Public Health</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Complementary &amp; Alternative Medicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biodiversity</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Ecology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13002-019-0307-2" ext-link-type="doi">https://doi.org/10.1186/s13002-019-0307-2</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hmong population in Lao PDR</title><p id="Par6">Laos is a multi-ethnic country. Tai populations, of which the lowland Lao constitutes a majority in Laos, have been colonizing the lowlands since the beginning of the thirteenth century. Ethnic minority groups include Mon-Khmer speaking groups (a branch of the Austro-Asiatic linguistic family) such as Khmer, Kantu, Talieng, Ta-Oy groups in the south, and Lamet and Khmu in the north. The other highland populations of Laos speak Tibeto-Burmese and Miao-Yao languages, and include Akha, Hmong, Yao, and Lahu.</p><p id="Par7">Hmong differ very much from the Tai/Lao, the Vietnamese, the indigenous Mon-Khmer population of Laos, and the other Tibeto-Burman hill tribes of northern Laos and northern Thailand. They are a particularly clearly identifiable group, who refer to themselves customarily as Hmong and speak dialects of the western or Chuanqiandian branch of Miao language in the Miao-Yao language family, one of the three main branches of this Miao language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most authors argue that the Miao/Hmong originated from Southern China, based on folk stories, linguistic, and cultural features they have developed or share with the Han Chinese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Hmong people started to migrate from their original homeland in the mid-nineteenth century as a result of oppression and conflicts with the Chinese. In less than 50 years, groups of Hmong people spread to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, and northern Laos where they are presently found. In the 1970s, due to political conflicts, more than 100,000 fled Laos. The path of exile took them to Thailand, then to the USA, France, Australia, Canada, and Argentina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">It is now estimated that the actual number of Hmong speakers around the world is between 4 and 4.5 million. There are approximately 3 million Hmong living in southern China (Yunnan province), 350,000 in northern Vietnam, and 100,000 in northern Thailand. In Laos, they are estimated to be about 230,000, making up about 5% of the total population.</p><p id="Par10">The total Miao population in China in 2000 was estimated at 9,200,000, of whom 3,100,000 are Hmong. The figure for the latter increases to 4.5 million world-wide if we add the following: 787,000 in Vietnam; 460,000 in Laos; 120,000 in Thailand; 2000–3000 in Myanmar; 200,000 in the USA; 15,000 in France; 2000 in Australia; 1400 in Canada; 300 in Argentina; and 110 in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, these data should be interpreted with caution, as they are almost 15 years old now, and also because there is a debate about the percentage of Miao people that should be defined as Hmong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Hmong are customarily divided into two major linguistic and cultural divisions, referred as the blue (or green) Hmong (<italic>Hmoog Ntsaub</italic>) and the white Hmong (<italic>Hmoob Dawb</italic>), according to the color of women’s traditional dress ornaments. Of greater social importance is the lineage or clan, as it constitutes the basis of Hmong social organization. Eighteen clans have been identified in Thailand and Laos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The clans are patrilineal, and strictly exogamous, meaning that at the time of marriage, a woman leaves her own clan and joins that of her husband. According to Ovesen, a person’s loyalty is always toward other members of his own clan, irrespective of the village or region of residence, and this basic clan solidarity is undiminished even among Hmong living in communities overseas. Indeed, given the migratory lifestyle of the Hmong, clan solidarity is extremely important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hmong traditionally subsist on swidden cultivation, and it is assumed that on their journey south, Hmong never stayed long enough in a place to develop a sustainable system of shifting cultivation. Most Hmong villages act only as temporary groupings of residential units. Historically, the Hmong were also opium growers, and although opium was once an important cash crop for them, the opium poppy is now grown mostly for medicinal personal use, as it has been the target of various eradication programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hmong traditional medicine and phytotherapy</title><p id="Par12">The lowland Lao pharmacopeia has historically been documented through a number of studies in medical botany. In colonial times, Vidal was a major contributor with more ten publications on the topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] together with Petelot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] then followed by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although studies have been undertaken in other ethnic groups, there has been little systematic documentation of medicinal plant use among highland groups.</p><p id="Par13">For the Hmong, traditional medicine is practiced as part of a vast cosmology. An outer visible world and an invisible one co-exist and great social and ritualistic importance is given to ancestors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The Hmong practise a combination of animism and ancestor worship. In this belief system, shamanic perceptions stipulate that the person is the host of 12 souls, all essential to life, that must remain in harmony in order to ensure good health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A first type of soul is a permanent resident of the body, while the second type is very unstable by nature. Spiritual illness occurs when one or more of the human souls become separated from the human body or become compromised in some other way, requiring intervention by a shaman. Shivering, difficulty in sleeping, startled responses, loss of appetite, fever, cold hands and feet, hearing and seeing things are psychological indications of having been frightened or suffering from the loss of a soul. The shaman’s role is to restore decaying souls and to fetch those that are wandering and bring them back in the body. Nevertheless, usually Hmong people describe only one soul, the <italic>pli</italic>, which is an essential vital spirit believed to be able to leave the body, causing sudden death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In addition, it is believed that all natural entities such as rocks and bodies of water (such as lakes and ponds) have spirits that may have a neutral, positive, or negative impact on a person’s spiritual well-being. In this system, there is interdependence between people living in the physical or visible world, and the deceased who inhabit the world of ancestors and other spirits. Violation of cultural norms governing relations between these two worlds may result in an ancestral spirit causing harm to the offender, his or her living family members or future descendants of the offender, and be the cause of loss of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Besides these spiritual causes of diseases, Hmong people believe that some illnesses, particularly those that are less severe and non-life-threatening, may have a biological cause requiring treatment with <italic>tshuaj ntsuab</italic> (herbs) or other organic substances such as dried animal parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These remedies may be used alone or in combination with spiritual healing. It was also noted that the techniques of acupuncture, massage, cupping, pinching, rubbing, steaming, and burning are also widely used by these ethnic groups and it has been hypothesized that many traditional remedies have been influenced by Chinese traditional medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Besides these studies, which have given a glimpse of the intricately linked Hmong medicine and cosmology, there are very few publications documenting Hmong pharmacopeia, especially recent ones. In Thailand, a nurse working in a refugee camp listed the name and uses of 15 plants used by a Hmong herbalist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In 1993, Anderson published a book, “Plants and People from the Golden Triangle” wherein he briefly reported the use of 52 species by Hmong villagers in northern Thailand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the same country, another author focused on plants used for women’s health and also listed a few species with medicinal uses present in Hmong home gardens in Northern Thailand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Elsewhere, one study focused on the ethnopharmacology of 37 introduced species used by Lao Hmong refugees in Minnesota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In China, a comparison has been made between the traditional knowledge of plant uses by the Hmong and the Li, both groups living around Limu mountain in Hainan island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Finally, in Laos, to the best of our knowledge, only three studies describe very briefly uses of medicinal plants by Hmong communities. In 1970, Vidal and Lemoine were the first to mention the use of species for medicinal purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]<bold>.</bold> Much later, Lundh mentioned the use of six species for women’s problems in villages in northern Laos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A recent study was also undertaken in Luang Prabang in northern Laos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Using quantitative ethnobotany tools, the authors listed 16 species widely used by Hmong herbalists, but did not mention their uses, as this paper addressed conservation issues. Currently, all over Lao PDR, in addition to personal use, medicinal plants are collected in large quantities for sale in markets by Hmong herbalists, mainly women. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, despite the wide use and marketing of medicinal plants by Hmong people in Laos, Hmong knowledge of medicinal plants has never been documented.</p><p id="Par18">Therefore, the objectives of this study are (i) to document the uses of plants by Hmong in three regions of Laos where Hmong communities dwell (two in the northern provinces and one near the capital city Vientiane) in order to describe and characterize Hmong pharmacopeia in Laos, and (ii) to understand the way knowledge of medicinal plants is transmitted and spread among the Hmong. More generally, we hope that this study will draw attention to an important health resource at risk because of overexploitation of natural resources, and will help in the integration of traditional medicines into the Lao national health system as recommended by the WHO (WHO Strategy of Traditional Medicine 2012), which is part of government health policy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Place of study</title><p id="Par19">This survey took place in three different provinces with Hmong villages (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, place of study): Bokeo and Xieng Kouang Provinces in Northern Laos, and Vientiane Province in central Laos.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Place of study</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13002_2019_307_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></p></fig></p><p id="Par20">In Bokeo province, the study was undertaken in the Hmong village of Ban Tup (Houay Xay district). Ban Tup is a compact village of 49 households, 1.5 h by motorbike from Houay Xay, the nearest urbanized center. Its inhabitants live mainly on swidden agriculture and an ecotourism activity organized in the park (Gibbon Experience Pek district project). Medicinal plant specimens were collected in the forested area composed of upper mixed deciduous forests (primary and secondary growth) surrounding the village, and on the edge of cultivated areas, or along pathways at an elevation ranging between 450 and 800 m.</p><p id="Par21">In Xieng Khouang province, the survey was conducted around Ban Nong Het village (Nongpet district) and in Phonsavan (Pek district) near the Vietnamese border. These districts are populated mainly by members of the Hmong ethnic group. Agriculture is a major component of the family economy together with diversified activities. The market held every Saturday in Ban Nong Het includes a section dedicated to the trade of medicinal plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Next most frequent were the woody part of plants (bark, wood, inner wood, and stem), followed by leaves. In 9% of the recipes, different plant parts of the same species are used together. Roots are combined with stems in 13 recipes, and roots are mixed with stems and leaves in 12 recipes. Interestingly, one of our interlocutors, a woman healer selling plants on the market, told us that according to the Hmong tradition, the best plant part for all type of remedies is always the root. However, because of the ongoing scarcity of some medicinal plants now, she felt it necessary to change roots for pieces of stem. This was also pointed out by other interlocutors, reaffirming that roots can be replaced by other plant organs (11 use reports).

The overall low number of plants found to decrease fertility in our study is consistent with the reports of other authors.

Symonds noted that these spontaneous abortions are particularly feared because for the Hmong, miscarriage is not only the physiological failure of a pregnant woman to bear a child, but is also considered a failure to extend the clan and lineage, and it has profound meaning related to the spirit and the soul of the unborn. Thus, every attempt is made by Hmong pregnant women to avoid miscarriage. This is why herbalists who know plants that can prevent unwanted abortion are highly respected and often consulted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">Fourteen use reports were recorded for the postpartum period. In Hmong culture, as well as in the Lao culture (and more broadly in South East Asia), the time following birth is recognized to be at high risk for the parturient. When the mother gives birth, she is considered to be in an unbalanced “cold” state, the same as when she has her period, making her highly vulnerable. Therefore, it is very important for the mother and child to be kept warm during the month following the birth, especially for the first 3 days. Still, Hmong women do not follow the tradition of lying by the fire (mother roasting) a practice commonly found in lowland Lao and some other ethnic groups, and which is widespread in Southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. There is also the need for the parturient to stick to strong dietary restrictions, as it is said that eating “wrongly” might cause serious health issues for the woman. Cold water and cold food (i.e., fruits and vegetables) are prohibited, because they are said to damage the person’s blood flow. It is explained that if the blood of a woman is unable to flow freely out of the body, this would cause various sicknesses in old age. Therefore, the main dish for women who have recently given birth consists of chicken boiled with special herbs. It is commonly said in Southeast Asian cultures that chicken is a heat-building and strengthening food. Herbs added to the broth are said to clean the uterus and remove any stale blood, therefore restoring it to perfect condition for the next conception and birth.</p><p id="Par61">In this survey, all the plants administered to women during this postpartum period were said to help in avoiding afterbirth complications (hemorrhages, fever), to give strength to the mother, clean the uterus, and avoid further health problems. The large majority of the species administered during post-partum, including the galactagogues, were prepared in form of chicken broth, using soft parts of plants. Among all plants cited, <italic>Smilax</italic> spp. tuber was mentioned twice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. <italic>Thunbergia grandiflora</italic>, a plant already mentioned for its abortive properties, was also cited as useful post-partum because of its strong action on the womb. <italic>Sambucus javanica</italic> was also repeatedly mentioned as a fertility enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">Leucorrhea and vaginal discharge with pelvic pain and persistent sensation of itchiness in the sexual organs are recognized as serious conditions, and the same for gonorrhea in men. These indications represent 26 use reports, corresponding to 21 remedies and 24 species, hence highlighting the importance of treating such conditions. <italic>Microglossa pyrifolia</italic> (Lam.) Kuntze and <italic>Urena lobata</italic> L. taken internally or as a local wash have been cited twice for these uses in two different places. It should be noted that <italic>U</italic>. <italic>lobata</italic> is also used in Northern Thailand, to avoid miscarriage, which makes it a species of great importance for women’s health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The ethnogenus <italic>Mussaenda</italic> spp. (<italic>M pubescens</italic> Dryand. and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sanderiana</italic> Ridl. can be used indifferently) is another important species for these uses.

It should be noted that Whitney (2014) working in Luang Prabang did not specify any medicinal plant uses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and that Anderson (1993) and Delang (2007) did not mention any Hmong vernacular name in their study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Use convergence</title><p id="Par64">In this survey, 41 species were collected in duplicate or triplicate in different places of study. Thirty-six percent (14) of them were used for a similar medicinal indication. In addition, use convergence was noted for some close-by taxons, collected in different places. This was the case for three <italic>Ardisia</italic> spp. (male tonic). <italic>Clausena excavata</italic> Burm.f. and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>lenis</italic> Drake (fever), <italic>Clerodendrum glandulosum</italic> Lindl. and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>schmidtii</italic> C.B.

The highest number of use convergences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] noted by far is in the gynecological sphere.</p><p id="Par65">The medicinal use of 28 species collected in this study were also reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Less than of half of them (15 or 44%) presented use convergence with our data. Again, we observed the highest number of use convergence for species used for gynecological purposes (nine citations over 15).</p><p id="Par66">In overall, these data suggest a general trend characterized by low overlapping of uses, with the notable exception for plants used for gynecological issue. Still, these results should be considered as preliminary. Firstly, because a medicinal species may have different uses not necessarily recorded at the time of the interview. Secondly, as half of our interlocutors were women and healers, one can make the hypothesis that more plants used for women would be known by them, as highlighted by Shrithi (2012) in her publication focusing on this type of knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Plant naming</title><p id="Par67">Although the Lao language is the usual language used in Laos for inter-ethnic communication, our Hmong interlocutors, when asked, could very seldom provide a Lao name for the plants they were showing us, suggesting that the plant knowledge is mostly inherited from their own culture. Nevertheless, a few exogenous inputs resulting from contact with other ethnic groups can be highlighted, through the names of a few plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this study, only two species were named after the source from which the knowledge has been drawn. <italic>Celosia argentea</italic> L. in Ban Tup is named <italic>paj maj</italic> meaning “flower Lamet,” as the use of this plant has been indicated by Lamet people, and <italic>Streblus</italic> sp. has a hybrid Hmong-Lao name: <italic>tshuaj maknao hav zoov</italic>, where <italic>makna</italic>o is the Lao name for lemon.</p><p id="Par68">Hmong language is monosyllabic, which means that the morphemes coincide with the syllables, or in other words that each syllable of a noun is significant by itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Vidal and Lemoine (1970) provided some insights on Hmong ethnotaxonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Plant denomination in Hmong follows the same general pattern as in Thai or Lao language where names are formed by one generic word followed by specificative(s) term(s). According to these authors, the generic term refers to the plant biological type (<italic>hmab</italic>: vine, <italic>pos</italic>: thorny, <italic>ntoo</italic>: tree, <italic>nroj</italic>: herb or treelet, <italic>suab</italic>: fern).</p><p id="Par69">In this survey, 386 different names were recorded. Among these, 60% (236 names) include a generic term, which display a much greater variability than previously noted by Vidal, as they referred to a specific part of plant (<italic>nblooj</italic>: leaf, <italic>paj</italic>: flower, <italic>txiv</italic>: fruit, <italic>qhaus</italic>: rhizome, <italic>cag</italic>: root, <italic>pos</italic>: thorn), the medicinal use of the plant (<italic>tshuaj</italic>: medicine), its food categories (<italic>zaub</italic>: leaf vegetable, <italic>qos</italic>: edible tubers), or its cultivated origin (<italic>vaj</italic>: from garden). Also, it was noted that this generic term can be facultative: in our corpus <italic>Aphaenandra uniflora</italic> (Wall. Ex G. Don) Bremek, <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic>, <italic>Pothos scandens</italic> L., <italic>Solanum spirale</italic> Roxb., <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> were named by different people, one giving the vernacular name with a generic syllable, the others without.</p><p id="Par70">Specific terms are composed from one up to four significant syllables, and refer to a wide range of different meanings. These include medicinal indications (<italic>Smilax ovalifolia</italic> and <italic>Spermacoce remota</italic> Lam. names are literally translated as “(vine) medicine apply ligament” and “good care hurt tooth”, which reflect their use), a morphological specificity of the plant (<italic>Leea rubra</italic> Blume ex. Sprengl. is “(root) big”, <italic>Embelia ribes:</italic> “(liane) 30 leaflets leaf”), a metaphor: <italic>Schefflera elliptica</italic> (Blume) Harms is “hand forest spirit” (because the petiol has the shape of a small hand gripping the stem), and <italic>Uncaria macrophylla</italic> “[thorn] horn sheep green” for the noticeable shape of the leaf is an organoleptic characteristic of the plant (<italic>Clausena lenis</italic> is named “[tree] dog pee”, for the smell of this species).</p><p id="Par71">From the 392 different vernacular names recorded in this study, 20 appear repeatedly. Only six of them refer to the same species, thus showing a lack of overlap between Hmong names and botanically defined species.</p><p id="Par72">Hmong plant name comparison (comparison was performed on the specificative part of the name) was also performed on the 41 species collected more than once in the frame of this study and on the 28 species collected in this study and also mentioned by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">In both cases, the percentage of names overlapping for the same species was small, as for a given species less than half of the names were similar (44% when comparing between species collected in this study and 46% if comparing with the literature). Moreover, poor plant name consistency was also observed within the same areas: in Ban Tup, a compact village of 49 households, ten species were collected in duplicates, of which seven bear different names; within Nongpet district, four species collected in duplicates were shown to us under different names.</p><p id="Par74">In general, a first examination of both uses and plant name overlapping seems to indicate a strong heterogeneity in practices and knowledge. The same observations were made by Anderson (1983) when working in hill tribes of northern Thailand, stating that “In fact plant use, both within a tribe and amongst other hill tribes is surprisingly inconsistent. Two evident exceptions are the introduced plant Eupatorium odoratum (anti-haemorrhagic) and Aloe vera (burns)” (p. 29). This affirmation was corroborated latter by Pake (1986): “Hmong herbalists do not share their knowledge of plants with one another and, therefore, do not use a given plant for the same purpose or in the same way if treating some ailments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].” In our opinion, the formation and settlement pattern of Hmong villages may partly account for this heterogeneity in plant names and associated knowledge. Still, it would be interesting to design a comparative study, in order to draw definitive conclusions about this apparent scattering of knowledge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Knowledge transmission</title><p id="Par75">All of the women interviewed defined themselves as <italic>Kws tshuaj</italic> (herbal healers) in opposition to <italic>tu txiv neeb</italic> (the shaman who deals with problems originating in soul disorders). They give advice about treatment, sell plants, and provide instructions for their use. Plants are delivered according to the symptomatology described by the customers, or the pathology diagnosed by the hospital or the general practitioner. When asked about their source of knowledge, all the women herbalists interviewed stated that they firstly learned medicinal plant uses from their mother (or grandmother when the mother passed away), who was also a healer, well trained in medicinal plant uses, or from a midwife. Medicinal plant use was generally approached by direct experience, through healing sessions or births, and during walks in the forest or in gardens when the young girl was accompanying her mother.</p><p id="Par76">Once married, some of the women also learnt from their mothers-in-laws (if they were knowledgeable about medicinal plants use) disclosing freely their recipes to their daughters-in-law. Besides these two main sources of knowledge, some women told us that they bought one or two recipes for specific ailments from other healers, but this was anecdotal. It was also stated that recipes disclosed by other healers are always very expensive, and it was noted that payment must be accompanied by a special ceremony to get the agreement of medicinal spirits, in order to avoid health misfortunes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Dreaming about medicinal plants was another type of transmission mentioned, but this was quoted only in two cases as extra information to already transmitted knowledge, and thus seems to be a minor source of information. In turn, all the women interviewed mentioned that they were committed to passing on their knowledge to one of their daughters or, if they did not have a daughter, to a very close niece.</p><p id="Par77">In this survey, we interviewed six men about medicinal plant uses while collecting plants in the wild with them. Only one of them was a renowned herbalist, who had specialized knowledge on medicinal plants that he gained from direct transmission from another herbalist, and was also a shaman. The five other men knew some medicinal plant uses, but did not present themselves as specialists or professional herbalists. They did have a basic knowledge they got from their domestic surroundings, watching other people using plants in daily life, or that they have been using themselves in various life occasions, but would not make a living from this. Therefore, it appears that there are two types of knowledge: a specialized, monetizable type, alongside popular knowledge that is open to all. According to in-depth interviews with female herbalists, the transmission is usually matrilineal, but this does not exclude the fact that men too can have access to this specialized knowledge, either through an initiation, from master to disciple, or by buying this knowledge.</p><p id="Par78">These data are congruent with what Lemoine stated in his doctoral thesis a study which took place in a small village in Sayabouri province and lasted 2 years (from November 1964 to January 1967, almost 50 years ago) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. “Medical art is open to all men and women but is nevertheless dominated by experts, the herbalists <italic>kws tshuaj</italic>, who combine the knowledge of medicinal plants with that of certain magical operations whose secret they pass on from master to disciple. Some plants are known to everyone, and if they are not indicated by an expert, it is not necessary to pay an initiation fee to know them. The position of herbalist can be purchased, and this is how one can be initiated to specialized secret knowledge about medicinal plants.”</p><p id="Par79">It was also explained that because the herbalists’ activity brings them economic benefits, and because there are many women involved in this type of business, recipes and plants are jealously kept secret. In this study, many women interviewed attributed their success as herbalists to the fact that they knew plants and recipes unknown to others, which ensures good results in treatments of “difficult” diseases.</p><p id="Par80">Usually, medicinal plant knowledge is passed down orally over generations through the females in the family, and strictly within the lineage, from mother to daughter during childhood and until puberty. Then, when the young woman marries, and is now considered to belong to her husband’s lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], it is her mother-in-law who continues to show her plants and recipes that she herself received from her own mother, if she has this ability. In fact, even if this type of knowledge is kept secret from outsiders, at each generation of women and marriage, knowledge transmission and enrichment continue, in a cumulative pattern.</p><p id="Par81">The fact that most herbalists are women, coupled with the fact that the transmission pattern follows a female lineage might also explain the importance of plants used for women, and the higher use convergence noted for gynecological use of the same species. Finally, strict oral transmission within the lineage, apprenticeship through direct experience, and more importantly the economic value associated with this knowledge, which entails a need for its non-disclosure, as well as repeated household movement of families from one village to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] may be valid reasons to explain the non-sharing of plant names, as made evident in this study. Still, these results should be interpreted as preliminary. In future research, more herbalists, both women and men, should be interviewed, to gain a better understanding of this specialized knowledge transmission strategy, while putting this in perspective with the high economic value that medicinal plants now represent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par82">The species collected in this study appear to be similar to those found in the dominant Lao lowland pharmacopeia previously described and to those already listed and well known in the Southeast Asian pharmacopeias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. We have highlighted the existence of a significant pool of pan-Asian or pan-tropical species with well-defined uses that have been already widely documented and even pharmacologically validated (i.e., <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, <italic>Bryophyllum pinnatum</italic> (Lam.) Oken, <italic>Senna alata</italic>, <italic>Aloe vera</italic> (all used for various dermatological problems), <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> (diarrhea), <italic>Embelia ribes</italic> (anthelmintic), <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic>, <italic>Coix lacryma-jobi</italic> (kidney problems), <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> and <italic>Anoectochilus lylei</italic> (lung and liver problems, adjuvent cancer treatment), <italic>Plantago major</italic> L. (asthma), <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic> (anti-hemorrhagic), <italic>Eleutherine</italic> spp., <italic>Acorus calamus</italic>, <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic>, <italic>Eurycoma longifolia</italic> Jack, <italic>Blumea balsamiflora</italic>, <italic>Oroxylum indicum</italic>, <italic>Ficus hispida</italic>, <italic>Mucuna pruriens</italic> (L.) DC., <italic>Morus alba</italic>, etc.). These data appear to contradict Anderson (1985) who noted that only a small number of the species collected in the remote Hmong mountain villages in Thailand are cited elsewhere but may be explained by Anderson’s prior publication of his work, and also by the place of study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, it would be interesting to continue these surveys in order to try to highlight whether there is a group of plants typically “Hmong,” emerging from the plants used by herbalists.</p><p id="Par83">This study also points out that the Hmong use pattern of plants is very similar to that of traditional lowland Lao healers living mainly in southern Laos. In both groups, there is a predominant use of roots. In comparing preparation procedures of medicinal plants by the Hmong and other healers in Laos did not allow to tease out practices that can be interpreted as uniquely “Hmong.” Plants are prepared in form of decoctions, infusions, and used in steam baths and medicinal baths, or as culinary preparations with therapeutic properties (such as chicken broth, stuffed hearts or steamed stuffed omelets) that blur the line between food and remedy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].</p><p id="Par84">However, unlike lowland healers, Hmong do not use a technique of preparing remedies called <italic>fon yaa</italic>, which consists in rubbing the hard ingredients of the remedies (stem, bark, root, shell, horn, etc.) on a special stone in a back and forth movement, and mixing the particles deposited with some water that will be drunk by the patient. This technique is characteristic of southern Laos, and it is clearly linked to ancient Khmer influence (Vidal 1958), and is therefore not integrated into Hmong practices. Finally, another difference that has been noted in the use of this pharmacopeia concerns the way in which postpartum is treated, even if some postpartum plants might be similar to both groups.</p><p id="Par85">Significant differences between the Hmong and lowland Lao traditional medicines can be seen in the aspects of gender, transmission methods, and renumeration. Lowland Lao medicine, strongly influenced by Theravada Buddhist tradition, is usually practised by men and transmitted through the male line; however, as for the Hmong, this may be variable. While Hmong medicine is passed down orally, lowland Lao medical knowledge may include a combination of manuscripts, written prescriptions, and oral transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Unlike the Hmong, lowland Lao healers do not traditionally accept payment for treatments, believing it to prevent the effectiveness of the medicine, and so renumeration is at the discretion of the patients, as an “offering,” and medical consultations usually take place in their houses in a village, although there are also “medicine sellers.” Thus, the Hmong have a greater financial imperative to keep their knowledge secret, within their lineage. In contrast, for the Lao healers, there is likely to be greater sharing and homogeneity in knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], although the more esoteric practices are not revealed to others and specific recipes are usually kept secret.</p><p id="Par86">Finally, it is important to underline the dynamic and evolving nature of the Hmong pharmacopeia and its uses. Indeed, besides the importance given to plants used for women and to male tonics that are very popular and which seem characteristic of Asian pharmacopeias, there is also a significant set of indications that are clearly in line with very contemporary health concerns: strokes, weight problems, metabolic disorders. This demonstrates that Hmong herbalists are committed to providing therapeutic solutions adapted to the needs of the local population. Hmong herbalists, therefore, appear as fully fledged actors of health in Lao society, and their knowledge and practice should be recognized and valued as such.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>We would like to thank Chanthanom Manithip, vice-president of the University of Health Sciences for her ongoing support, all Hmong people interviewed for their willingness to share their knowledge with us.
