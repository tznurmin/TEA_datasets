High-burden uptake of apoptotic cells is associated with loss of phagocytosis in resolution phase macrophages. Here, using a transcriptomic analysis of macrophage subsets, we show that non-phagocytic resolution phase macrophages express a distinct IFN-β-related gene signature in mice. We also report elevated levels of IFN-β in peritoneal and broncho-alveolar exudates in mice during the resolution of peritonitis and pneumonia, respectively. Elimination of endogenous IFN-β impairs, whereas treatment with exogenous IFN-β enhances, bacterial clearance, PMN apoptosis, efferocytosis and macrophage reprogramming. STAT3 signalling in response to IFN-β promotes apoptosis of human PMNs. Finally, uptake of apoptotic cells promotes loss of phagocytic capacity in macrophages alongside decreased surface expression of efferocytic receptors in vivo. Collectively, these results identify IFN-β produced by resolution phase macrophages as an effector cytokine in resolving bacterial inflammation.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">Clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages is important for the resolution of inflammation.

macrophages to restore organ structure and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Macrophages recognize apoptotic cells through unique ‘eat me’ signals and cognate receptors and engulf them in an efficient and tightly regulated-manner to avoid autoantigen exposure and metabolic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In turn, the efferocytic macrophages undergo reprogramming that diverts proinflammatory cells to cells that drive tissue repair and resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A unique subset of non-phagocytic pro-resolving macrophages is generated during resolving inflammation following high-burden efferocytosis and exposure to pro-resolving mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These CD11b<sup>low</sup> macrophages exhibit increased expression of 12/15-lipoxygenase (LO), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, reduced arginase 1 expression and emigration to distant sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Neutrophil apoptosis is perceived as one of the control points that limits the number of neutrophils at sites of inflammation and pushes ongoing inflammation towards resolution. Inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and bacterial constituents, such as GM-CSF, LPS and bacterial DNA (CpG DNA) can prolong the lifespan of neutrophils by delaying apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> predominantly by preserving the expression of the BCL2 family protein Mcl-1. By contrast, pro-resolving mediators, such as 15-epi-LXA<sub>4</sub>, annexin A1, resolvin E1, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> facilitate degradation of Mcl-1 and consequently promote neutrophil apoptosis.</p><p id="Par5">The role of type I interferons in host response to viruses is well established, whereas the contribution of these cytokines to anti-bacterial defense is less clear. IFN-β has been reported to limit immune responses in some experimental models of inflammation through induction of IL-10 and/or inhibition of the inflammasome and IL-1β production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. IFN-β was also found to block cancer progression by limiting the recruitment of pro-angiogenic neutrophils into tumors and deletion of endogenous IFN-β was associated with delayed apoptosis of tumor-associated neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. By contrast, IFN-β accelerates monocytic inflammation by attracting Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes to sites of chronic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Enhanced IFN-β expression was detected in DNAse II-deficient embryonic macrophages that lack phagolysosomal degradation of DNA and hence accumulate large amounts of DNA from apoptotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, thereby limiting erythrocyte differentiation and leading to severe anemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, IFN-β may exert important bioactivities consistent with a role in resolving inflammation.</p><p id="Par6">Here we use an unbiased transcriptomic analysis to identify IFN-β as an effector cytokine that is produced and acting during resolution of peritonitis and <italic>E.coli</italic>-evoked pneumonia. Mechanistically, IFN-β overrides pro-survival cues and promotes apoptosis in murine and human neutrophils through STAT3 activation, and enhances efferocytosis by resolution phase macrophages, leading to the reprogramming of these macrophages to an anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving phenotype. Finally, we show that non-phagocytic macrophages are generated exclusively following the uptake of apoptotic cells in an irreversible manner, and this conversion is associated with reduced surface expression of efferocytic receptors. These findings identify IFN-β as a macrophage-derived multi-pronged effector in resolving inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Non-phagocytic macrophages have a distinct transcriptome</title><p id="Par7">Since non-phagocytic macrophages compose a significant portion of resolution phase macrophages, we aimed to identify the molecular characteristics that distinguish these cells from their phagocytic counterparts. To this end, we performed transcriptome analysis of PKH2<sup>hi</sup> (phagocytic) and PKH2<sup>lo/−</sup> (non-phagocytic) F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages sorted from resolving exudates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Non-phagocytic resolution phase macrophages express IFN-β. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Male mice were injected intraperitoneally with zymosan A (1 mg/mouse) followed by an injection of PKH2-PCL at 62 h. After 4 h, the peritoneal cells were recovered and immuno-stained for F4/80 and CD11b. Then, F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages were sorted based on the extent of PKH2-PCL acquisition (PKH2 + /− populations; &gt;98% purity) using the FACSAria III sorter (illustrated in (<bold>a</bold>). The collected cells were immediately used for RNA extraction (with RNA integrity value above 7.5), and a gene expression microarray analysis was performed using Illumina hiSeq 2500.

Of these genes, 1511 were upregulated and 1534 were downregulated in non-phagocytic macrophages. We performed gene ontology annotation to characterize the functional groups of the genes affected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). As expected, non-phagocytic macrophages downregulated phagocytosis-associated functions, such as endocytosis, membrane invagination, small GTPase signaling and cell adhesion. Notably, non-phagocytic macrophages displayed significant metabolic changes, including increases in oxidative phosphorylation and oxidation-reduction processes. Non-phagocytic macrophages also showed reductions in gene groups associated with tissue repair, such as blood vessel development and morphogenesis, extracellular matrix, protein kinase activity and cell adhesion (required for wound retraction), while increasing locomotor activity. These findings are consistent with the origin of non-phagocytic CD11b<sup>low</sup> macrophages that differentiate from M2–like macrophages during the resolution of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and with their capacity to migrate to distant sites. These macrophage subsets expressed low levels of markers for peritoneal resident macrophages, such as GATA6 (1.37 and 0.19 RPKM for phagocytic and non-phagocytic macrophages, respectively), Tim4 (relative values of 3.47 and 1.26 RPKM, respectively), and TGF-β2 (relative values of 0.25 and 0.01 RPKM, respectively) with no detectable levels of another marker, GPR37<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

Both subsets did express high levels of the monocyte markers CD115 (424.49 and 217.42 RPKM, respectively), and CD74 (1733.47 and 2631.85 RPKM, respectively), indicating that they originated exclusively from monocyte-derived macrophages rather than yolk sack-originated resident macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Non-phagocytic macrophages express IFN-β-associated genes</title><p id="Par9">Our transcriptome analysis also revealed that non-phagocytic macrophages express a distinct protein signature profile (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) consistent with upregulated IFN-β expression and activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This profile is similar to that observed following macrophage activation due to impaired DNA degradation.

To confirm IFN-β-associated activation of non-phagocytic macrophages, we compared the expression of IFN-β and its target gene <italic>Isg15</italic> in non-phagocytic and phagocytic macrophages. Western blotting of peritoneal macrophages and cell-free exudates from <italic>Ifnb</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mice revealed the existence of two different species of IFN-β (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>a, b), a 50–66 kDa isoform that is the most prevalent in resident and resolution phase macrophages, and a 25–35 kDa isoform that prevails in the exudates, which was scarcely detectable in macrophages. Notably, all the secreted isoforms were diminished at 16 h PPI upon clodronate-mediated depletion of resident peritoneal macrophages (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref>). However, peritoneal IFN-β levels were not abrogated by administering clodronate-containing liposomes during the resolution phase (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>c–d), probably due to IFN-β secretion by non-phagocytic macrophages that cannot be depleted by clodronate. Furthermore, during the resolution phase, we detected intracellular IFN-β protein only in F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages and not in lymphocytes or eosinophils (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2e</xref>). <italic>Ifnb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> macrophages had the same background staining as the 2<sup>nd</sup> antibody control. Moreover, the 25–35 kDa isoforms and, to a higher extent, the 50 kDa isoform were present in both resident and resolution phase macrophages, whereas the 66 kDa isoform was exclusively expressed in resolution phase macrophages (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2f</xref>). Analysis of organelle fractions of RAW264.7 macrophages that were incubated with apoptotic cells revealed presence of the 50 and 66 kDa isoforms of IFN-β in the ER and secretory vesicles (which contain calnexin and rab7, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2g</xref>). The 25–35 kDa isoforms are present in the ER and negligible in secretory vesicles. These results suggest that the 25 kDa IFN-β would undergo posttranslational modifications in the ER that would prevent its secretion. Once these modifications are removed, IFN-β is immediately secreted, hence the 25–35 kDa isoforms are the only forms detected consistently in peritoneal fluids, but scarcely inside macrophages. Notably, non-phagocytic macrophages (PKH2<sup>lo</sup>) expressed significantly higher levels of the 50 kDa isoform and ISG15 (2.56 and 1.7 fold increase, respectively) than their phagocytic counterparts (PKH2<sup>hi</sup>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c–e</xref>). In addition to the predicted band at 15 kDa, we also detected ISG15 immunoreactivity at the 60 kDa band with 3-fold higher level in non-phagocytic than phagocytic macrophages. This band likely corresponds to a protein modified by the ubiquitin-like nature of ISG15. Thus, non-phagocytic resolution phase macrophages exhibit increased expression of IFN-β and its downstream signaling.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Non-phagocytic macrophages exhibit an IFN-β-related gene signature</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Gene</p></th><th colspan="2"><p>PKH2<sup>hi</sup></p></th><th colspan="2"><p>PKH2<sup>lo</sup></p></th><th><p>Fold change (log2)</p></th><th><p><italic>Q</italic> value</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><italic>Ifnb1</italic></p></td><td><p>−0.34</p></td><td><p>0.33</p></td><td><p>3.26</p></td><td><p>4.38</p></td><td><p>3.89</p></td><td><p>0.0011</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Ifitm1</italic></p></td><td><p>6.21</p></td><td><p>7.00</p></td><td><p>8.67</p></td><td><p>9.47</p></td><td><p>2.47</p></td><td><p>0.0024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Il1b</italic></p></td><td><p>11.20</p></td><td><p>10.99</p></td><td><p>13.67</p></td><td><p>13.34</p></td><td><p>2.41</p></td><td><p>0.0006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Isg15</italic></p></td><td><p>7.12</p></td><td><p>6.07</p></td><td><p>9.09</p></td><td><p>8.23</p></td><td><p>2.03</p></td><td><p>0.0006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Cxcl9</italic></p></td><td><p>2.19</p></td><td><p>1.35</p></td><td><p>3.99</p></td><td><p>3.60</p></td><td><p>1.97</p></td><td><p>0.0006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Ifit1</italic></p></td><td><p>5.06</p></td><td><p>3.15</p></td><td><p>6.82</p></td><td><p>5.12</p></td><td><p>1.80</p></td><td><p>0.0006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Ifit3</italic></p></td><td><p>1.45</p></td><td><p>0.34</p></td><td><p>3.31</p></td><td><p>1.98</p></td><td><p>1.79</p></td><td><p>0.0006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Ccl2</italic></p></td><td><p>8.55</p></td><td><p>8.75</p></td><td><p>10.04</p></td><td><p>10.50</p></td><td><p>1.64</p></td><td><p>0.0159</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Isg20</italic></p></td><td><p>3.12</p></td><td><p>3.13</p></td><td><p>4.48</p></td><td><p>4.99</p></td><td><p>1.63</p></td><td><p>0.0006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Ifitm6</italic></p></td><td><p>7.69</p></td><td><p>7.81</p></td><td><p>8.88</p></td><td><p>9.70</p></td><td><p>1.60</p></td><td><p>0.0062</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Ccl3</italic></p></td><td><p>8.85</p></td><td><p>8.77</p></td><td><p>9.86</p></td><td><p>10.30</p></td><td><p>1.28</p></td><td><p>0.0006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Ccl5</italic></p></td><td><p>8.37</p></td><td><p>7.16</p></td><td><p>9.55</p></td><td><p>8.13</p></td><td><p>1.12</p></td><td><p>0.0006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>Cxcl10</italic></p></td><td><p>7.60</p></td><td><p>7.58</p></td><td><p>8.08</p></td><td><p>8.89</p></td><td><p>0.95</p></td><td><p>0.0006</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Log2 of RPKM values</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par10">Since non-phagocytic macrophages are generated during the resolution phase of inflammation, we monitored the kinetics of peritoneal fluid IFN-β during insult. We detected two peaks in IFN-β level during zymosan A-induced peritonitis in mice. The first peak occurred during the inflammatory phase (at 4 h post peritonitis initiation (PPI)), and the second one during the resolution phase (at around 72 h PPI) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Unchallenged peritoneal macrophages expressed IFN-β protein, which expression was reduced at 4 h upon exposure to zymosan A. Subsequently, at 24–72 h PPI, IFN-β levels in peritoneal macrophages exceeded the expression displayed in unchallenged macrophages (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2f</xref>). These results would indicate production of IFN-β by peritoneal resident macrophages prior to challenge and its release in response to inflammatory stimuli. Monocytes would then infiltrate the inflamed peritoneum, differentiate to macrophages and phagocytose apoptotic PMN, eventually resulting in loss of phagocytosis and IFN-β expression during the resolving phase. To test this hypothesis, we challenged resolution phase macrophages with apoptotic cells, the pro-resolving cytokine TGF-β or the viral mimicry poly (I:C). Apoptotic cells or TGF-β evoked modest increases in IFN-β secretion, whereas poly(I:C) resulted in a robust increase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). These findings suggest that progressive accumulation of apoptotic PMN by high-burden non-phagocytic macrophages during resolving inflammation leads to de novo synthesis and secretion of IFN-β and the activation of IFN-β signaling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>IFN-β contributes to timely resolution of <italic>E.coli</italic> pneumonia</title><p id="Par11">To explore the role for IFN-β in resolving inflammation, we studied the kinetics of its production and development of PMN apoptosis in a model of spontaneously resolving bacterial pneumonia.

Indeed, the recovered peritoneal macrophage population was still dominated by Tim4<sup>−</sup> macrophages (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a, b</xref>) and macrophage numbers were in fact reduced in <italic>Ifnb</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mice at 48 h PPI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>), whereas the number of peritoneal resident macrophages was similar in unchallenged wild type and <italic>Ifnb</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a–c</xref>).

To this end, we injected apoptotic cells, latex beads (LB) or IgG-opsonized LB labeled with green fluorescence alongside PKH2-PCL red into the peritoneal cavity during the resolving phase of peritonitis, and assessed the uptake of PKH2-PCL and labeled targets by macrophages. Our results show that only macrophages that engulfed high amounts of PKH2 were able to engulf LB or IgG-opsonized LB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9c–d</xref>), moreover these PKH2<sup>hi</sup> macrophages phagocytosed more apoptotic cells than their PKH2<sup>lo</sup> counterparts, while PKH2<sup>−</sup> macrophages did not engulf apoptotic cells at all (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9e</xref>). Thus, PKH2 uptake correlates well with the phagocytosis of target particles, and the initial apoptotic cell engulfment seem to limit both efferocytosis and PKH2 acquisition. Along these lines, we also found that only apoptotic cells diminished PKH2 uptake by macrophages (36% reduction), whereas LB or opsonized LB did not affect uptake (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9f–g</xref>). Since uptake of high numbers of apoptotic cells parallels with loss of phagocytosis, it is conceivable that its termination will lead to reversal of non-phagocytic macrophages to the phagocytic state. To address whether loss of phagocytosis is reversible, we first injected PKH2-green into mice undergoing peritonitis followed by an injection of PKH2-red 12 h later. Peritoneal macrophages were collected and analyzed for dye uptake at 4–8 h after the second injection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9h</xref>), and PKH2-green<sup>+</sup> macrophages were phenotyped according to the dye ratio. Thus, macrophages that acquired equal amounts of PKH2-green and PKH2-red (the diagonal group in the dot-plot) represent sustained phagocytosis and constituted the majority of macrophages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9i</xref><bold>)</bold>. Macrophages that engulfed more PKH2-red than PKH2-green represent increased phagocytosis and constituted a minute fraction of the population. Macrophages that engulfed more PKH2-green than PKH2-red represent reduced phagocytosis and the percentage of this subset increased with time while sustained phagocytosis was reduced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9i, j</xref> show representative images and cumulative data, respectively). Our transcriptomic analysis revealed markedly reduced expression of the genes coding for the efferocytic receptors Mertk and CD206 with slight decreases in CD36 in non-phagocytic macrophages (6.7, 2.03, and 1.46  fold reduction, respectively). Consistently, we detected significantly lower surface expression of all three efferocytic receptors (57%, 64%, and 49% reduction for CD36, CD206, and Mertk, respectively) whereas CD45 expression was unaffected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9k–l</xref>). This expression profile resembles that of eosinophils that are non-phagocytic cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9l</xref>). Thus, macrophage loss of phagocytosis seems to be a progressive and irreversible process in vivo and is associated with reduced expression of efferocytic receptors through transcriptional and none-transcriptional mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">We demonstrate here a previously unappreciated role for IFN-β; upon its induction and secretion by non-phagocytic resolution phase macrophages, IFN-β promotes neutrophil apoptosis and efferocytosis as well as polarization of macrophages towards a pro-resolving phenotype, thereby facilitating timely resolution of bacterial inflammation. We propose that IFN-β mediates both feedback and bidirectional crosstalk between non-phagocytic macrophages, phagocytic macrophages and neutrophils, thereby defining a novel resolution circuit.</p><p id="Par24">The role of specialized lipid mediators (SPM), like lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and proteins, such as annexin A1 and galectin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> in limiting both inflammation and fibrotic tissue repair has been established in recent years. However, up to date, only 2 major cytokines have been associated with resolving inflammation, namely TGF-β and IL-10. TGF-β is produced during the resolution phase of spontaneously resolving inflammation in experimental animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and specifically following the uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. IL-10 exerts paramount anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, albeit it is not always produced during the resolution phase of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. A common feature of both TGF-β and IL-10 is the enhancement of clearance of apoptotic PMN via efferocytosis that is essential for prevention of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> and limiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Here we show that IFN-β also possesses similar properties. Previous studies have shown that intracellular annexin A1 facilitates TLR3 and TLR9-mediated IFN-β production by macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and IFN-β mediates the expression of the pro-resolving receptor FPR2 on macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Our RNA-Seq analysis (BioProject accession No: PRJNA450293) also indicate upregulated annexin A1 and FPR2 expression in non-phagocytic resolution phase macrophages (1.93 and 5.5. fold increase, respectively), presumably due to stimulation by engulfed apoptotic PMN and/or IFN-β. Hence, TLR-mediated sensing of apoptotic cell constituents might trigger an IFN-β-associated response in resolution phase macrophages.</p><p id="Par25">Previous studies have shown that the uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocytes can initially enhance high-burden efferocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, which will be limited when their oxidative stress and metabolic constraints dominate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that a subset of CD11b<sup>low</sup> macrophages that appear during the resolution phase of inflammation contain high numbers of apoptotic cells but are devoid of efferocytic activity and PKH2 acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Hence, these macrophages were termed satiated macrophages. Whether the uptake of apoptotic cells is the sole driving force of satiation is difficult to determine, though it is well-established that macrophage reprogramming to anti-inflammatory phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and probably to the CD11b<sup>low</sup> phenotype as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> is mediated by efferocytosis in vivo. Hence, uptake of apoptotic cells, predominantly neutrophils, by macrophages during the resolution phase likely plays a paramount role in macrophage loss of phagocytosis and satiation. Our results demonstrate that the non-phagocytic phenotype in resolution phase macrophages exhibit increased transcription and secretion of IFN-β but not other type I IFNs. Consistently, we detected higher IFN-β levels in resolving exudates of the peritoneum and bronchoalveolar space parallel with increased rates of apoptotic death in infiltrating PMN. Importantly, genetic deletion or neutralization of IFN-β lead to reduced PMN apoptosis in vivo as well as upon culture ex vivo. Conversely, treatment with exogenous IFN-β enhanced neutrophil apoptosis both in the <italic>E. coli</italic> pneumonia and peritonitis models. It is important to note that IFN-β effectively overrode survival cues from TLR ligands, such as CpG DNA and LPS, as well as the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A, and redirected human PMN to apoptosis. Such an inhibitory action was still detectable when IFN-β was added at 4 h post-challenge, further highlighting the therapeutic potential of this cytokine. Our results point toward STAT3 activation and increased Mcl-1 degradation as main mechanisms underlying the apoptosis-promoting action of IFN-β in human PMN. Inflammatory activation of PMN seems essential for the pro-apoptotic activity of IFN-β. These findings are in line with a previous report of IFN-β promotion of apoptosis in tumor-infiltrating neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Notably, increased IFN-β levels were also detectable during the onset of inflammation in our peritonitis and pneumonia models. However, IFN-β did not abrogate neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed peritoneum. Thus, the pro-resolving actions of IFN-β on neutrophils can primarily be attributed to enhancing apoptosis and its consequences.</p><p id="Par26">Our results demonstrate IFN-β promotion of efferocytosis of apoptotic PMN in vivo during the resolution phase of peritonitis and pneumonia. Importantly, this pro-efferocytic activity was independent of enhancing PMN apoptosis since the uptake of apoptotic cells ex vivo was also abrogated in <italic>Ifnb</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> macrophages. The findings that both TGF-β and apoptotic cells can induce IFN-β secretion by resolution phase macrophages would raise the intriguing possibility that IFN-β may, at least in part, mediate the pro-efferocytic activity of TGF-β, which is also produced during efferocytosis. We also show that IFN-β is involved in the expression of IL-10 by resolution phase macrophages and the reprogramming of these macrophages to a pro-resolving phenotype. Since IL-10 also promotes engulfment of apoptotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, it is conceivable that IL-10 might act downstream to or in concert with IFN-β to promote efferocytosis.</p><p id="Par27">During the resolution of inflammation macrophages that have engulfed high numbers of apoptotic PMN downregulate CD11b and F4/80 expression and become CD11b<sup>low</sup> macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These macrophages might be converted from an M2-like profibrotic phenotype to a pro-resolving phenotype (termed Mres) that is characterized by the increased expression of the SPM producing enzyme 12/15-LO, and reduced expression of the M2 marker arginase 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Our transcriptome analysis confirms that phagocytic CD11b<sup>high</sup> macrophages display an increased gene profile commensurate with an M2, reparative phenotype. Functional gene annotations relevant to this designation include blood vessel development, extracellular matrix, protein kinase activity, and cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation and cell adhesion. The phagocytic nature of these macrophages is highlighted by the increased expression of genes associated with endocytosis, membrane invagination, cytoskeletal protein binding and adhesion molecules. The loss of phagocytic properties that characterizes non-phagocytic resolution phase macrophages is associated with reduced expression of these functional gene groups and an increase in the expression of a distinct IFN-β-related gene signature with functional designations like immune, defense and inflammatory responses. Other upregulated gene groups that might be related to the non-phagocytic CD11b<sup>low</sup> phenotype include locomotor behavior and oxidation-reduction processes. These functions are linked to loss of phagocytic function and increased migration to remote sites, which are characteristic features of these macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

Based on these and our current results, we conclude that IFN-β is a paramount effector cytokine in resolving inflammation.</p><p id="Par28">Since non-phagocytic macrophages are an important source of IFN-β during the resolution of inflammation, we further characterized their properties and regulation of their tissue levels. Our results suggest that non-phagocytic macrophages are formed from the phagocytic pool of macrophages that originates from blood monocytes and characterized as F4/80<sup>hi</sup> macrophages. As resolution progresses, the uptake of apoptotic PMN and other cells, but not other phagocytic targets, converts resolution phase macrophages to the non-phagocytic state with complete loss of phagocytic capacity. Subsequently, non-phagocytic macrophages will reduce surface expression of efferocytic receptors, like CD11b, CD36, CD206, and Mer as well as the transcripts of other efferocytosis-related genes, such as low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), Dynamin 1 and 2, and dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (DOCK) 1 (BioProject accession No: PRJNA450293)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. IFN-β expression in macrophages is associated with a posttranslational modification that generates 50–66 kDa products that are stored in the secretory vesicles. These modifications need to be removed for secretion because macrophages release only the 25–35 kDa form. Additional studies on the mechanism that controls the secretion of IFN-β and possibly other cytokines as well, are undoubtedly warranted to further our understanding of the role of IFN-β. For clinical aspects of IFN-β therapy please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplemental Discussion</xref>.</p><p id="Par29">Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of efferocytic satiation and identify a novel IFN-β−mediated circuit that contributes to the termination of bacterial inflammation through facilitating PMN apoptosis and efferocytosis, and macrophage reprogramming to pro-resolving phenotypes. These findings would also suggest the therapeutic potential of IFN-β in chronic and non-resolving inflammation, as well as fibrotic disorders and wound repair.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par30"><italic>Ifnb</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> male and female mice (Erlandsson et al., 1998) were a kind gift from Prof. Issazadeh-Navikas (University of Copenhagen).
