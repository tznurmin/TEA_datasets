The Amp-AgNps was characterized by UV-VIS spectroscopy, TEM, XRD, FTIR and TGA. FTIR and TGA results suggested that amine group of Ampicllin reduce the metalic silver into nano form. These results were further validated by computational molecular dynamics simulation. The antibacterial potential of Amp-AgNps was investigated against sensitive and drug resistant bacteria. MIC of Amp-AgNps against 6 different bacterial strains were in the range of 3–28 µg/ml which is much lower than the MIC of ampicillin (12–720 µg/ml) and chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles (280–640 µg/ml). The repeated exposure to drugs may lead to development of resistance mechanism in bacteria against that drug, so the efficacy of Amp-AgNps after repeated exposure to bacterial strains were also studied. The results indicate that bacterial strains do not show any resistance to these Amp-AgNps even after exposure up to 15 successive cycles. The biocompatibility of these Amp-AgNps was checked against cell lines by using Keratinocytes cell lines (HaCaT).</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001411</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_43309.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nanotechnology is the branch of science which deals in tuning and modifying the organic or inorganic materials into desired and unique nanomaterials. These materials are gaining importance in medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, pharmaceuticals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, cosmetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, food and beverages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, paper and pulp and many more industries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Medicate resistance is a noteworthy issue worldwide and the boundless utilization of expensive range of anti-infection agents has delivered resistance against pathogenic microbes. Among medication, numerous extensive variety of anti-microbial agents are economically accessible against Gram-positive and Gram negative microscopic organisms but the wide utilization of these agents has made microorganisms create resistance against them. There are several mechanism by which bacteria develop resistance against the antibiotics example some microbes express enzymes that modify and degrade the antibiotics, modification of cellular component and formation of efflux pumps are another mode of resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The endeavors have been made to defeat the resistance system by different methodologies, for example, to adjust the structure of β-lactam moiety of anti-infection agents and to integrate new anti-microbials of high productivity despite the fact that these techniques are tedious and are frequently not monetarily possible. To overcome, there is a requirement for the improvement of new and compelling drugs and restorative methodologies that provide assistance in fighting medication resistance.</p><p id="Par3">Studies revealed that the metal nanoparticles can be used as effective antimicrobial agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Among metals, silver nanoparticles are widely used in catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, bioremediation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, bioimaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and in antimicrobial therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Though, the researchers have widely explored the antibacterial efficacy of silver nanoparticle but their mode of action is still not clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. They show antimicrobial activity against different types of microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, silver nanoparticles modified with different stabilizers such as polymers, carbohydrates, amino acids and antibiotics generally showed an increased antibacterial activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Brown <italic>et al</italic>. 2012 reported the adsorbtion of ampicillin on citrate coated chemically synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Their study suggested that the antibiotic attaches to silver/gold nanoparticles via thioether moiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Rogowska <italic>et al</italic>. 2017, compared the binding/adsorption of ampicillin to chemically synthesized nanoparticles (20 nm) coated with sodium citrate and biologically synthesized nanoparticles (by Actinomycetes strain CGG 11n, average size 17 nm). They observed that adsorption of ampicillin on citrate capped silver nanoparticles is less stable compared to biologically synthesized may be due to disequilibrium in binding of silver to the negatively charged citrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The ampicillin adsorbed to biologically synthesized nanoparticles, is more stable as these nanoparticles are coated with an organic layer which acts as a stabilizer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, physical adsorption may cause leaching of the drug from the nanoparticles. Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>. 2017 reported an effective antimicrobial nanoantibiotic by covalently attaching ampicillin to core-shell Ag@SiO<sub>2</sub>. AgNPs were formed by the chemical reduction of silver nitrate then a silica shell was produced by hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate, the core-shell Ag@SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles then coated with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane. Finally, the amino-functionalized nanoparticles were reacted with ampicillin through an acid-base coupling reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, there is a need to develop new and efficient protocols to modify silver nanoparticles with conventional drugs. Rai <italic>et al</italic>. 2010 reported the synthesis of gold nanoparticles using second generation antibiotic cefaclor and their antimicrobial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. There are very few reports on the synthesis of gold nanoparticles using antibiotics but so far no reports are available for silver nanoparticle synthesis using antibiotics. Therefore, in the present work silver nanoparticles were synthesized in a one step reaction using ampicillin as a sole reducing and capping agent, so that synthesized silver nanoparticles posses dual properties that of ampicillin and silver nano.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">Ampicillin is a semi-synthetic derivative of penicillin, a β lactam antibiotic that functions as an orally active broad-spectrum drug. It has been used extensively to treat bacterial infections since 1961. The extensive use of antibiotics results in the development of bacterial resistance against them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The number of papers have reported that silver nanoparticles are effective against drug resistance bacteria but Panaeck <italic>et al</italic>. 2018 reported that the repeated use of chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles led to the emergence of bacterial resistance against gram negative bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This resistance is due to the production of flagellum protein flagellin, which causes aggregation of nanoparticles, thus new strategies should be developed to enhance the bactericidial properties of silver nanoparticles. Mohler <italic>et al</italic>. 2017 reported that conjugation of metal ions to β-lactam antibiotics can enhance their antimicrobial properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Thus in the present study synthesis of silver nanoparticles was carried out by the reduction of silver ions using ampicillin. The concentration of metal salt, reducing agents, temperature and time plays important role in synthesis, thus all these parameters has been optimized. The formation of Amp-AgNps was monitored by varying the concentrations of silver nitrate and ampicillin from 2 mM to 15 mM, the results show that as the concentration of silver nitrate/ampicillin increases the absorption intensity increases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>) these results were in agreement with earlier published results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The maximum synthesis was achieved at a concentration of 10 mM in both cases. The λ<sub>max</sub> of brown color solution was obtained at 406 nm after 3.5 hr that is characteristic of the surface plasmon resonance of silver nanoparticles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The controls of ampicillin and silver nitrate separately did not show any peak in the visible region indicating that ampicillin is responsible for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> corresponds the UV-Vis spectrum of Amp-AgNps at a temperature of range 40–70 °C. The spectrum shows that as the temperature increases from 40 °C to 60 °C, the intensity of synthesis increases and maximum was achieved at 60 °C, the SPR band is also shifted to lower wavelength from 40 °C at 420 to 60 °C at 406 nm. The blue shift in SPR band is characteristic of smaller size silver nanoparticle synthesis. Beyond 60 °C the SPR band is constant only intensity of formation has been reduced. This may be due to hydrolysis and decarboxylation of ampicillin at high temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The stability of these Amp-AgNPs was studied by keeping them at room temperature for three month in solution phase. The UV-Vis spectra were recorded and no change in SPR was observed indicating that Amp-AgNPs are highly stable. The DLS studies were carried out to determine the hydrodynamic radius of Amp-AgNps which reveals that silver nanoparticles have average diameter of 44.12 ± 2.89 nm. The particle size distribution was determined by calculating Polydispersity index (PDI) and PDI was found to be 0.32. Further zeta potentials was determined to check the stability of colloidal suspensions and was found to be +33.42 mV, which indicate a long-term stability of Amp-AgNps in suspension phase. To know about the size and morphology, TEM analysis of Amp-AgNps were performed. TEM micrographs shows that the Amp-AgNps are spherical of diameter 9–20 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). The elemental analysis was performed by EDX which confirms the formation of Amp-AgNps (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). XRD data shows the peaks of cubic phase at 111, 200, 220 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) which confirms the crystalline nature of Amp-AgNps. XRD results correspond to JCPD file no. 03–0921. The FTIR spectrum of only ampicillin shows the bands at 3250, 1690, 1605, 1417, 1396 and 1350 where 3250 correspond to -OH, 1690 is C=O stretching vibrations of four membered ring lactams<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, 1605 primary amine and peak at 1417, 1396 and 1350 were contributed to characteristic β lactam ring vibrations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The peak at 1625 cm<sup>−1</sup> for Amp-AgNps is due to amine group, that has been shifted to a higher wavenumber in comparison to the primary amine of pure ampicillin (1605 cm<sup>−1</sup>), suggested the role of primary amine group of ampicillin in reduction of Amp-AgNps. The β-lactam ring bands and other bands do not show any shift in Amp-AgNps as compared to pure ampicillin. Hence it can be inferred that while formation of Amp-AgNps, β-lactam ring of ampicillin preserves its integrity. Similar, result has been reported by Rai <italic>et al</italic>., 2010 on the formation of gold nanoparticles using cefaclor antibiotic as a reducing agent. The primary amine group of cefaclor acted as both the reducing and capping agent for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles leaving the β -lactam ring unaffected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The ampicillin content of Amp-AgNps was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in order to obtain quantitative amount of ampicillin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The weight loss curve of ampicillin and Amp-AgNps reveals three different weight losses. Initial 2.1% to 4.3% weight loss in the temperature region 30–200 °C which may be due to physical adsorption of ampicillin on the surface of Amp-AgNps. The second weight loss corresponds to the decomposition of ampicillin in a temperature range of 218 to 565 °C that may be the result of covalent interaction of an amine group with silver nanoparticles indicating that higher energy is required for the desorption of ampicillin from silver nanoparticles. The loss value of nanoparticles is 54.2% and approximately 32% of silver was calculated using TGA in Amp-AgNps. The results suggest that the loss value of pure ampicillin is 86.4%, hence the efficient amount of ampicillin on silver nanoparticles is about 62.5%. Lastly the weight loss was observed at higher temperature region around 565 to 610 °C which is most likely due to the electrostatic interaction of the amine group. To validate that amine group is responsible for the synthesis of Amp-AgNps computational studies was done. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of ampicillin upon Ag<sup>+</sup> (Amp-AgNps) binding was carried out to evaluate the stability of a system under exploited solvent condition. RMSD plot suggested that the binding of silver ion stabilized the ampicillin. It has been observed that Amp-AgNps structure underwent a deep transition of 0.641 nm to 3.93 nm and system got optimized at 2.7 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Ampicillin consists of 3 rings that is benzene ring, beta-lactam ring and thiazolidine ring. To study the interaction of ampicillin and silver particle, simulation at different time scale were done. The results clearly indicate that in aqueous state silver particle is interacting with the amine group of benzene ring of ampicillin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). The structure obtained at different time frames were dumped which shows the interaction of sliver particle with benzene ring (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Further, number of contacts that silver is making with these rings were calculated and plotted as a graph to show the contacts between silver and different rings of ampicillin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). The graph clearly shows that sliver particle is making highest number of contacts with the benzene ring.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>UV-Vis spectra recorded as a function of concentration of silver nitrate (<bold>A</bold>), Ampicillin (<bold>B</bold>), time (<bold>C</bold>) and temperature (<bold>D</bold>) for Amp-AgNps.</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2019_43309_Fig1_HTML.png"/></p></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM micrograph (<bold>A</bold>), EDX (<bold>B</bold>), XRD pattern (<bold>C</bold>) and FTIR (<bold>D</bold>) of Ampicillin (red) and Amp-AgNps (black).</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2019_43309_Fig2_HTML.png"/></p></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TGA analysis of Amp-AgNps (curve a) and Ampicillin (curve b).</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2019_43309_Fig3_HTML.png"/></p></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RMSD plot for molecular dynamic simulation of Amp-AgNps.

Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the microscopic images of ampicillin sensitive and resistant bacterial strains with and without Amp-AgNps. The blue cells are the viable bacterial cells which are stained by DAPI, at low concentrations of Amp-AgNps the number of viable cells are more as the concentration of Amp-AgNps increases the number of viable cells decreases. On the basis of above results it may be inferred that bacteria can uptake Amp-AgNps and disrupt the DNA leading to cell death. To study the live/dead bacteria another fluorescence assay was performed using propidium iodide and SYTO 9 dyes and the results are shown in Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. The staining was performed at 488 nm laser excitation and 530 nm emission filters for SYTO 9 and at 561 nm laser excitation and 640 nm emission filters for propidium iodide. After the incubation of treated and untreated bacterial cells with propidium iodide and SYTO 9 respectively, the Amp-AgNps treated cells were stained intensely red which indicates the dead cells whereas untreated cells were fluorescing green which indicates the live cells. Moreover the results demonstrate that at low concentrations of Amp-AgNps (MIC/4) shows higher number of live bacteria and lesser number of dead bacteria whereas at higher concentrations of Amp-AgNps (MIC/2), the number of live cells decreases and dead cells increases. Hence these results confirmed the bactericidal action of silver nanoparticles which may be due to cell destruction and inhibition of cellular propagation.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fluorescence microscopy images of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells treated with and without Amp-AgNps at MIC/2 concentrations for 6 h, subsequently stained 30 min with DAPI.</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2019_43309_Fig5_HTML.png"/></p></fig><fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fluorescence microscopy images of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells treated with Amp-AgNps at MIC/4 &amp; MIC/2 concentrations for 6 h, subsequently stained for 30 min with SYTO9 (green) and PI (red) for antibacterial activity.

The Amp-AgNps are found to be non toxic (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) to mammalian cells with significant antibacterial activity against ampicillin resistant and multidrug resistant bacteria. This may be due to difference in the composition of cell membrane of bacteria and mammal. The bacterial membrane consists of peptidoglycan layer made up of sacchride units and majorly hydrolysis of bonds of sacchride units of peptidoglycan layer lead to cell death of bacteria. It is well established that ampicillin inhibits enzymes present in the bacterial cell walls, such as transpeptidases and carboxypeptidases which are mainly responsible for the synthesis of peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The literature clearly indicates that β lactam antibiotics resemble d-alanylalanine peptide fragment an enzyme substrate which facilitates binding of penicillin-binding proteins. These penicillin binding proteins are a group of enzymes found anchored in the cell membrane, which are involved in the cross-linking of the bacterial cell wall. The antibiotic irreversibly binds to the active site of these enzymes, disrupting cell wall synthesis.

The β lactum ring of antibiotic does not participate in reduction as suggested by FTIR and computational MD simulation. Thus, the synthesized silver nanoparticles show potent antimicrobial activity as compared to chemically synthesized nanoparticles. Moreover they are effective against MDR. The repeated exposure of bacterial cultures with Amp-AgNps does not show any emergence of resistance. Thus these Amp-AgNps can be used as drugs against the resistant bacteria as these are non toxic as shown by MTT assay. Future studies should be carried out to modify silver nanoparticles with different kinds of drugs and such studies can be beneficial in combating the emerging threat of resistance among the bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par11">Silver nanoparticles (10 nm) and Silver nitrate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
