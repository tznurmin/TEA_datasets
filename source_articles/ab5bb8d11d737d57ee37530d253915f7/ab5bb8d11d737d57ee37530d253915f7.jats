Due to its ability to transmit copious pathogens, adaptability to diverse climates, flexibility in oviposition sites, and desiccation-tolerant eggs, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are significant worldwide epidemiological burdens, leading to hundreds of millions of infections annually resulting in over 50,000 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To decrease the imposed global burden, many vector control methodologies have been developed and implemented, including a number of innovative genetic-based technologies such as the release of insects carrying dominant lethal (RIDL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the infection and introduction of mosquitoes harboring the intracellular bacterium, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> either spread into populations to reduce viral transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], or used for population suppression through <italic>Wolbachia</italic> induced cytoplasmic incompatibility (IIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, there are also a number of innovative âgene driveâ based technologies that are rapidly being developed in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with the hope of making an impact in the future, in addition to innovative methods of generating sterile males using CRISPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nonetheless, the most prevalent form of mosquito control used in the field today is the traditional use of chemical insecticides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although insecticides can have an impact on mosquito populations, due to their high costs, environmental impacts, requirements for continuous application, and rapid susceptibility to resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], they are not sustainable long-term solutions. Therefore, significant efforts are necessary to discern the underlying molecular, genetic and physiological mechanisms important for arboviral vector competence with the overall aim of developing additional novel, insecticide-free methods to disrupt viral disease cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">At both larval and adult stages, mosquito sensory systems play pivotal roles in mediating a variety of behaviors, including locating food resources, habitat selection, and predator avoidance (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). As such, sensory systems provide attractive targets for suppressing vector behaviors at both the larval and adult stages. Over the years there have been numerous studies on adult mosquito sensory systems that have greatly advanced the field, such as the discovery of key olfactory and gustatory receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] as well as behavioral responses to host cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Notwithstanding, there remains critical gaps in understanding the direct relationships between sensorimotor and behavioral responses, specifically important for behaviors linked to vector competence such as host seeking and chemical avoidance. Additionally, only a handful of studies have focused on larval chemosensory systems resulting in significant gaps in a holistic understanding of mosquito sensory systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For example, olfaction is important for detecting long-range host cues in adult mosquitoes. However in an aquatic environment, either gustation, olfaction, or both, could detect long-range food indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Food scarcity is an important ecological constraint on mosquito larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], but little is known about the chemosensory mechanism of foraging in larval mosquitoes. Given the relative simplicity of the larval nervous systems, understanding chemosensory signal transduction, coding, and behavior in larvae could lead to novel control interventions and enable a more holistic understanding of mosquito behavior in areas such as food seeking and chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Notwithstanding, as of recently, we have lacked effective genetic tools to study mosquito larval sensory systems as they process environmental information. Current tools used in mosquitoes to monitor neural activity include extracellular recording from sensilla and antennal lobe cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], as well as using synthetic calcium-sensitive dyes (e.g., FURA-2) in vivo, or in heterologous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To overcome the challenges of these existing approaches, here we have engineered <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to ubiquitously express a Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicator (GECI), termed GCaMP6s. GCaMP6s enables imaging of sensory-evoked calcium transients through changes in relative fluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Using this tool we gained the unprecedented ability to concurrently measure in vivo sensory responses and motor responses with high spatial and temporal resolution in regions of neuropil and muscles of live responding mosquitoes. This enabled us to generate functional insights into the importance of chemosensory channels in mediating behavior (e.g. foraging) by inactivating distinct olfactory and gustatory channels and measuring larval neural responses to diverse chemosensory stimuli in various genetic backgrounds such as those harboring mutations in important olfactory and gustatory receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Taken together, our results demonstrate the utility of GCaMP6s to link the sensory processing of specific stimuli to behavior responses of swimming larvae, thereby gaining a deeper functional understanding of mosquito multisensory integration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Development of an optogenetic-reporter of neuronal activity in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic></title><p id="Par12">To visualize live calcium activity, we engineered a transgenic <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> strain harboring genomic sources of a genetically-encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To express GCaMP6s, we utilized the <italic>polyubiquitin</italic> promoter (AAEL003877, henceforth <italic>PUb</italic>), chosen for its generally high expression during nearly all developmental life stages and tissues as shown by previous promoter characterization experiments and developmental transcriptional profiling (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We inserted the <italic>PUb</italic> promoter upstream of the coding sequence for GCaMP6s within a randomly inserting <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposable element. Downstream to the <italic>PUb</italic> promoter driven GCaMP6s, we included an OpIE-2 promoter driving dsRed expression to serve as a robust transgenesis marker (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). To obtain a transgenic strain, the engineered <italic>piggyBac</italic> transgene was injected into the germ cells of 200 pre-blastoderm stage <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> embryos (0â1Â h old). Transgenic G1 mosquitoes harboring the transgene were readily identified by a bright expression of OpIE-2 driven dsRed in the abdomen, in addition to a robust calcium signaled activation of GCaMP6s in muscle and neural cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). To ensure that this strain represented a single chromosomal insertion, we backcrossed isolated individuals for four generations to wild-type (+/+) and measured Mendelian transmission ratios each generation and observed 50% of offspring inheriting the transgene, indicating that this strain likely represents a single chromosomal insertion. To precisely determine its genomic insertion location, we used inverse PCR and found the location of insertion to be on the 2nd chromosome with flanking 5â² and 3â² <italic>piggyBac</italic> regions positioned at AaegL5.0 reference (genomic loci 285,175,805â285,176,289 and 285,175,275â285,175,803, respectively. The location of the insertion site was mapped to a intronic region of an uncharacterized locus. To determine the fitness cost of our inserted transgene, we performed experiments comparing fertility, fecundity, egg hatching rate, and larval development time of our GCaMP6s inserted line to +/+. These experiments indicated that the transgene insertion did not significantly affect fertility (pâ=â0.4376), egg hatching rate (pâ=â0.1536), or larval development time (pâ=â0.2034), however fecundity was slightly increased (pâ&lt;â0.05) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S1). <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>RNAseq expression, schematic representation of the GCaMP6s construct and larval fluorescence.

Distinct regions-of-interest (ROIs) were imaged across various sensory organs of adult mosquitoes using laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Calcium-evoked changes in fluorescence varied between sensory organs tested. For example, the tip of the maxillary palp displayed significant changes in fluorescence intensity across 4 replicates presumably related to the location of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) within capitate peg sensilla on the maxillary palp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (meanÂ ÎF/F0 is 1.24âÂ±â0.13, <italic>p</italic> valueâ=â0.0323, replicates 4) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1A, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Video 1).

Additionally, when observing clusters of ommatidia within the adult eyes, changes in calcium signaled GCaMP6s activation were highly stochastic across 4 replicates presumably due to continuous optical responses as the mosquito is sensing the environment (meanÂ ÎF/F0 is 0.02âÂ±â0.01, p-valueâ=â0.4700; â 0.15âÂ±â0.20, p-valueâ=â0.4398; 0.02âÂ±â0.04, p-valueâ=â0.4949, for ROIs 1â3 respectively) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1C, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Video 3). Although these results indicated that many regions (e.g. adult antennal flagellum and adult ommatidia) did not demonstrate significantly consistent odor-evoked responses across multiple replicates, accurate detection of subcuticular fluorescence was hindered by the adultâs thick cuticle and dense setation. To overcome this limitation in adults, we performed careful dissections of the head cuticle which enabled us to investigate the labeling efficacy of our GCaMP6s strain within the adult antennal lobe by examining several major cell types of potential interest to mosquito sensory processing. We found that GCaMP6s expression is sufficiently high to morphologically characterize diverse cell types includingÂ those within individual glomeruli, lateral cell cluster neurons, glia, and medial cell cluster neurons which will be invaluable for future studies (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Relative odor-evoked GCaMP6s responses in larvae</title><p id="Par14">Compared to adults, 2nd instar larvae have relatively simplified neuroanatomical systems and a transparent cuticle making them well suited for detecting subcutaneous changes in fluorescence intensity reported by GCaMP6s without the need for dissections. These factors coupled with the limited knowledge regarding mosquito larval sensory responses motivated us to simultaneously image muscle and sensory calcium-evoked responses with the GCaMP6s/+/+âstrain. Using either a 5âÃ or 10âÃâobjective permitted us to record fluorescence in the whole body, or just the head capsule, respectively. Results from these experiments revealed significant changes in calcium transients within the longitudinal muscles within the 2nd abdominal segment across 4 replicates (meanÎF/F0 is 3.45âÂ±â0.57, p-valueâ=â0.0011) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1D, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Video 4) in the body in addition to the lateral retractors (mean ÎF/F0 is 2.04âÂ±â0.77, p-valueâ=â0.004497), the deuterocerebrum (DE) across (mean ÎF/F0 is 0.45âÂ±â0.14, p-valueâ=â0.002150) and medial retractors (mean ÎF/F0 is 2.57âÂ±â01.27, p-valueâ=â0.013050) in the head (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1E, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM8">8</xref>: Video 5). To further determine the cell type specificity of <italic>PUb</italic>-GCaMP6s expression within the larval brain, co-staining for GFP as well as either Glutamine Synthetase (GS) (which labels astrocyte-like glial) or alpha tubulin (which labels the nervous system) was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

This assay consisted of adhering the dorsal side of the larval head to a chambered cover glass, thereby immobilizing the head, while the larva was submerged in enough water to enable constant imaging of calcium transients within the head capsule while the tail could freely swim and the breathing tube could siphon oxygen (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Importantly, the larval head capsule is strikingly transparent requiring no surgical removal of cuticle thus enabling the larva to survive for extended periods (up to 48Â h) permitting multiple recordings on the same individual. Responses in the DE and lateral abductors were analyzed as representatives of neural and muscle responses, respectively with at minimum 3 biological replicates per stimuli. Stimuli tested included chemicals previously shown to be relevant to adult mosquitoes such as a known olfactory receptor agonist (2-(4-Ethyl-5-(pyridin-3-yl)-4<italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylthio)-<italic>N</italic>-(4-ethylphenyl) acetamide, henceforth VUAA1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], attractants (1-octen-3-ol, ethyl acetate and lactic acid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], a known exciter of multiple groove-peg OSNs (butylamine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and other behaviorally relevant compounds (sucrose, lobeline, glutamate, fish food) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. All stimulants were prepared at 6âÃâ10<sup>â5</sup>M, with the exception of fish food (see â<xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">Selection and preparation of odorants</xref>â). Previous studies have demonstrated mosquito larval response to various stimuli at concentrations ranging from 10<sup>â5</sup> to 10<sup>â2</sup>M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], here we used the bottom range of concentrations in order to prevent overstimulation within our small chamber. By stimulating GCaMP6s/+/+âlarvae to this panel of chemicals we found that there were significant calcium responses in the DE to several stimuli including 1-octen-3-ol (max ÎF/F0 is 6.09âÂ±â3.85, p-valueâ=â0.0145), butylamine (max ÎF/F0 is 3.29âÂ±â3.05, p-valueâ=â0.0092), ethyl acetate (max ÎF/F0 is 3.14âÂ±â2.61, p-valueâ=â0.0077), lobeline (max ÎF/F0 is 2.57âÂ±â2.17, p-valueâ=â0.0224), lactic acid (max ÎF/F0 is 2.31âÂ±â1.72, p-valueâ=â0.0366), and VUAA1 (max ÎF/F0 is 2.12âÂ±â1.66, p-valueâ=â0.0458), while sucrose (max ÎF/F0 is 2.01âÂ±â2.70, p-valueâ=â0.1053), glutamate (max ÎF/F0 is 0.79âÂ±â0.61, p-valueâ=â0.1632), and fish food extract (max ÎF/F0 is 0.62âÂ±â1.02, p-valueâ=â0.6101) did not display significant changes in fluorescence intensity when compared to responses evoked by water (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, e, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM10">10</xref>: Figure S4, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM11">11</xref>: Figure S5A). Interestingly, 1-octen-3-ol, a known mosquito adult attractant produced by microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], displayed the greatest calcium response, followed by butylamine and ethyl acetate, with the former previously documented to induce a response in activated grooved-peg OSNs in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, <italic>Anopheles quadriannulatus</italic>, and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Moreover, when observing muscle responses to the same stimuli we observed significant calcium increases in 5 of the 6 stimuli that also displayed significant responses in the DE. These stimuli included 1-octen-3-ol (max ÎF/F0 is 6.38âÂ±â1.50, p-valueâ=â2.91e-05), butylamine (max ÎF/F0 is 6.11âÂ±â4.04, p-valueâ=â4.11e-05), ethyl acetate (max ÎF/F0 is 3.10âÂ±â2.88, p-valueâ=â0.00096), lobeline (max ÎF/F0 is 2.41âÂ±â2.45, p-valueâ=â0.00408), and VUAA1 (max ÎF/F0 is 3.16âÂ±â2.16, p-valueâ=â0.00437). Similar to the DE, the muscles did not exhibit significant responses to sucrose (max ÎF/F0 is 1.04âÂ±â1.64, p-valueâ=â0.07634), glutamate (max ÎF/F0 is 0.68âÂ±â1.07, p-valueâ=â0.1453), or fish food (max ÎF/F0 is 0.59âÂ±â0.45, p-valueâ=â0.1534) when compared to responses evoked by water. Contrary to results from the DE, responses by muscles to lactic acid (max ÎF/F0 is 1.53âÂ±â1.88, p-valueâ=â0.07509) were not significant. Lastly, the universal expression of GCaMP provided an opportunity for temporal comparison between brain and muscle responses. When analyzing the latency in response between the DE and muscles (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, c), 1-octen-3-ol elicited a significant latency of 2.24âÂ±â3.19s (p-valueâ=â0.003036), while butylamine elicited a latency of 0.48âÂ±â1.11s (p-valueâ=â0.2867) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). Furthermore, a persistence in response to 1-octen-3-ol was seen in the DE but not in the muscle. This contrasted with the response to a majority of the other stimuli including butylamine where fluorescent expression in the muscle matched that of the DE (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM12">12</xref>: Figure S8). To further explore the potential functionality of our GCaMP6s mosquito line, we used two-photon microscopy to investigate higher spatial resolution in imaging GCaMP6s expression. Although this experimental protocol was unsuitable for imaging stimulus-evoked responses due to the substantial movement of the brain, we were able to image various regions of interest throughout the brain of live, head-fixed larvae (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), demonstrating that this technique may be useful for future studies in larval neurobiology such as larval vision or nociception.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.Â 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Live calcium imaging of stimulus-evoked responses in GCaMP6s/+/+, GCaMP6s/orco5â/â, and GCaMP6s/Gr3â/â.

Previous studies have demonstrated that orco is a highly conserved subunit of ORs that influences multiple odorant receptors and plays a role in the discrimination between different host organismsâ olfactory cues. Gr3 on the other hand has been noted to play a major role in CO<sub>2</sub> detection, thus also affecting host detection. Using our larval tethered-swimming confocal imaging assay and stimulus panel described above to compare calcium evoked responses between GCaMP6s/+/+, GCaMP6s/orco5â/â, GCaMP6s/Gr3â/â enabled us to parse out receptors important for eliciting responses to various stimuli. Interestingly, we found that, compared to GCaMP6s/+/+, the DE and muscles of GCaMP6s/orco5â/â elicited fewer significant responses to stimuli (p-valueâ&gt;â0.05) as well as a general reduction in calcium evoked responses to all stimuli (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S2, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>: Figure S3B). Only butylamine elicited significant responses compared to the water control in the muscles (max ÎF/F0 is 5.20âÂ±â2.60, p-valueâ=â8.55e-4) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM11">11</xref>: Figure S5B). Additionally, when comparing DE and muscle responses between GCaMP6s/orco5â/â and GCaMP6sâ+/+, only muscle responses to 1-octen-3-ol and VUAA1 within GCaMP6s/orco5â/â showed a significant decrease (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM11">11</xref>: Figure S5E). A strong decrease in DE response to 1-octen-3-ol was also seen in GCaMP6s/orco5â/â, however it was not significant (max âF/F is 2.14âÂ±â1.30, p-valueâ=â0.0563). Examining the latency of response in GCaMP6s/orco5â/â demonstrated that stimulation with 1-octen-3-ol elicited responses in muscles 5.27âÂ±â6.50Â s after activation of the DE (p-valueâ=â0.04412), while butylamine showed little difference in the latency between DE and muscle response (0.13âÂ±â1.14Â s; p-valueâ=â0.9492) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f).

Taken together, our results demonstrate orcoâs role in the detection of numerous chemosensory stimuli. Additionally, we found that orco may play an important role in 1-octen-3-ol detection and response. A nonsignificant reduction of response in the DE yet a significant reduction in the muscles indicate that even strong yet insignificant decreases in neural response may lead to a significant reduction of muscle output.</p><p id="Par17">In contrast to the GCaMP6s/orco5â/â mutants, GCaMP6s/Gr3â/â mutants showed more robust calcium-evoked responses, and were generally not significantly different from those of GCaMP6s/+/+âwith the exclusion of muscle responses to 1-octen-3-ol (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM11">11</xref>: Figure S5CâE).

Individual larvae were allowed to acclimate inside the dark behavior arena before a stimulus - either food extract, 1-octen-3-ol, or a water-only (negative) control - was added to one side of the arena, and responses were analyzed and compared for the 15-minute acclimation period and the following 15-minute experiment period (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Furthermore, our results from behavioral experiments suggest interesting avenues of future research in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> chemosensory processing. The robust expression of GCaMP6s in various mosquito tissues (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) allows quantification of stimulus-evoked responses in both motor and sensory systems, and in the adult and larval stages, including the adult antennae, adult maxillary palps, larval deutocerebrum (DE), and larval muscle (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1). This broad GCaMP6s expression allowed us to investigate both motor and sensory responses in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae to an ecologically relevant panel of chemosensory stimuli. These cues elicited spatiotemporal patterns in GCaMP6/+/+âlarval muscle and central nervous system (CNS), and revealed that key components of natural odors may be relevant across <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> life stages (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1). In addition, monitoring both muscle and neural response allowed for visualization of stimuli specific relationships between the sensory and motor responses. Some stimuli elicited a neural response followed by a muscle output, however some demonstrated a neural response with no muscle output possibly due to a lack of behavior related to the stimulus. Also some stimuli generated a muscle response without the detection of a neural response possibly due to neural processing of that stimulus within a different region of the brain outside of our imaging plane. Further, when we crossed this GCaMP6s/+/+âline with orco5â/â mutant to generate GCaMP6s/orco/â/â, we observed attenuation in these stimulus-evoked responses, particularly in response to known OR ligands (VUAA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], 1-octen-3-ol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM10">10</xref>: Figure S4). By contrast, GCaMP6s/Gr3â/â larvae showed no significant impairment in response to any of the odorants tested, indicating that the heteromeric CO<sub>2</sub> receptor complex is not critical for the detection and response to these stimuli in the larval stage. This supports previous transcriptome work suggesting that the Gr3 receptor is expressed at very low levels in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of these GCaMP6s/mutants for investigating the neural representation of chemosensory-mediated stimuli. Interestingly, our neuronal imaging showed no significant response to food odors, however muscle responses were observed. This may reflect the fact that our dorsal imaging plane did not extend into the ventral sub-oesophageal ganglion (SOG), which is innervated by sensory nerves from the mouthparts. Future experiments may look into imaging additional neuropils to detect any possible neural responses. Finally, our behavioral experiments contextualized some of these stimulus-evoked responses in a more naturalistic environment, revealing that ORs may act in parallel with other chemosensory channels during foraging behavior in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Firstly, due to the nature of the <italic>PUb</italic> promoter, GCaMP6s expression can occur in all types of cells. The lack of specificity may make interpreting results and expression patterns difficult. For example, we observed muscle responses to VUAA1 (an olfactory receptor agonist) which likely represent activation of other sensory channels and subsequent downstream responses in the motor system rather than direct stimulus-evoked olfactory responses. Nevertheless, for the purpose of our experiments, the broad expression of GCaMP6s allowed for a general and holistic overview of a chemosensory responses to various stimuli. For future experiments that may want to utilize this strain to examine responses from specific cell types or neurons, it can be complemented with other neuronal recording techniques, such as patch clamp, to allow for the accurate quantification of specific cells while also the ability to generally visualize responses surrounding the cell of interest.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par21">Our results highlight important avenues of future research in mosquito sensory processing. First, the mechanisms of chemosensory cue detection in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae remains an open question. In terrestrial environments, long-range chemosensory stimuli are largely limited to volatile compounds with high vapor pressure at ambient temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae inhabit an aquatic environment that is a rich source of chemical signals far more varied in size, polarity, and structure, such as large proteins, amino acids, long hydrocarbon chains, and multi-molecular fragments of organic debris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae express far fewer ORs than adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and have a markedly smaller and physiologically less developed antennal lobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. <italic>Ae.aegypti</italic> larvae may rely on a more diverse assortment of IRs and GRs, in addition to ORs, to detect a wide range of water-borne chemicals relevant to behaviors such as foraging and predator avoidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Characterization of the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larval IRs and GRs may help identify chemical compounds that are most relevant to larval environments, and lend insight into the spectrum of larval chemical receptors. In addition to receptor-level chemical detection, the mechanism of chemosensory processing in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larval CNS is not well understood. Aquatic crustaceans integrate information from hydrodynamic detectors and two distinct types of chemosensory receptors within the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], but it is unclear if <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> sensory transduction follows this same model. From an evolutionary perspective, comparing the mechanism of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larval olfaction to crustacean, amphibian, and fish models may also provide critical insight into the convergent evolution of aquatic chemosensation. Our <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> GCaMP6/+/+âstrain is of particular interest as it is, to our knowledge, the first example of GCaMP6 expression in an aquatic insect model.</p><p id="Par22">Additionally, some odor components are shared among multiple ecologically relevant cues for mosquitoes, and neurobiological implications of these correlations are unclear. For example, 1-octen-3-ol is a component of both host odors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and microbial byproducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] that may function as food for larval mosquitoes. It is not unreasonable to hypothesize that there may be strong evolutionary selection on mosquito ORs that are beneficial in both life-history stages, and if so, identifying those chemicals that operate as both larval attractants and adult host cues may provide attractants that can be leveraged for mosquito control. Moreover, the mechanism of chemotaxis in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae remains an open question. In other insect models such as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, larvae employ active sampling strategies to locate and navigate to food cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. But it is unclear how <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae navigate chemosensory signals in an aquatic environment that is quite different in volume and turbidity from those experienced by <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> or even <italic>E. coli [</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref><italic>]</italic> and <italic>C. elegans [</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref><italic>]</italic>, which navigate chemosensory gradients at a significantly smaller scale. Quantitative modeling and further behavioral experiments may help better understand chemotaxis in an enigmatic aquatic insect model, and highlight interesting commonalities and differences in navigation strategy across different environments and spatial scales.</p><p id="Par23">Generalizing further, the GCaMP6s/Gr3â/â and GCaMP6s/orco5â/â mutants could address critical gaps in our broader understanding of multisensory integration and sensorimotor responses, particularly in adult mosquitoes. Behavioral work in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> adults presents compelling evidence for the involvement of multisensory integration in host-seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, little is known about the neural bases of these behaviors. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, GCaMP6s imaging has revealed the functional basis of information convergence in higher-order brain areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Future work with GCaMP6s/+/+âmay similarly help decode the neural representations of multimodal host cues in mosquitoes, and provides motivation for the development of transcriptional control systems such as GAL4/UAS or the Q-system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] for tissue-specific GCaMP6s expression. Importantly, we observed high GCaMP6s expression in both muscle and neuropil (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM12">12</xref>: Figure S8). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, concurrent analysis of neural response and motor output has facilitated experiments in the integration of sensory processing and sensory-motor transformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. By taking advantage of this simultaneous recording capacity in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, additional experiments could investigate how these multisensory integration pathways mediate motor responses, and ultimately, determine behavioral decisions such as host choice and oviposition site preference. Finally, these GCaMP6s/+/+âmosquitoes and GCaMP6s/Gr3â/â and GCaMP6s/orco5â/â mutants could provide additional information and strategies for the control of disease-vector mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes may use olfactory indicators of larval habitat quality to choose oviposition sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. A better understanding of chemosensory cues that elicit strong responses in larvae could help identify new attractants for use in oviposition traps, or oviposition deterrents for use in homes and outdoor water containers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Insect rearing</title><p id="Par24">Mosquitoes used in all experiments were derived from of the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> Liverpool strain, which was the source strain for the reference genome sequence.

No light was detected inside the arena under experimental conditions (LI-250A Lightmeter, instantaneous measurements, sensitive up to 0.01 Âµmol s<sup>-1</sup>Â m<sup>-2</sup> per ÂµA. LI-COR Biosciences #Q40129). Animals were allowed to acclimate for 15Â min in a custom 3D printed porcelain behavior chamber (ID #XWEEPACQA, Shapeways, New York, NY, USA) containing 20Â mL of milliQ water. 100Â ÂµL of a chemical stimulus was then pipetted into the left side of the arena. Larvae were tested only during the day phase of the diurnal light cycle. Larvae were housed individually until eclosion to determine sex, and animals that died before eclosion were omitted from analyses.</p><p id="Par34">Larval movement was recorded at 2fps for the 15Â min acclimation period, as well as the 15Â min experiment following stimulus introduction, using a Basler Scout Machine Vision Area Scan GigE camera (scA 1000-30gm, Ahrensburg, Germany) and Basler pylon Viewer Windows software. Larval trajectories were analyzed using ImageJ Fiji [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] and custom software written in Python (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.python.org" ext-link-type="url">http://www.python.org</ext-link>): Multitracker by Floris van Breugel (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/florisvb/multi_tracker" ext-link-type="url">https://github.com/florisvb/multi_tracker</ext-link>), as well as a batch-processing Multitracker add-on, Multivideo Multitracker by Eleanor Lutz (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/eleanorlutz/multivideo_multitracker" ext-link-type="url">https://github.com/eleanorlutz/multivideo_multitracker</ext-link>) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In brief, videos were cropped and contrast-enhanced in ImageJ Fiji. Larval position was extracted using frame-by-frame subtraction in Multitracker. Trajectories were manually inspected in the Multitracker GUI, where missing data points were added and extraneous tracked objects removed. We then converted trajectory position from pixel values to mm using the ratio of the known width of the behavior container. Finally, we calculated the instantaneous speed of the larva, in mm, for each frame. Using these position and speed values, we then calculated the mean instantaneous speed (mm/s) and preference index (PI; proportion of time spent in the odor half - proportion of time spent in the non-odor half).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Fitness experiments</title><p id="Par35">To determine the impact our GCaMP6s transgene insertion on mosquito fitness, a series of fitness experiments comparing the female fecundity, male fertility, larval hatchability, and duration between larval and pupal stages between our GCaMP6sâ+/+âline and the wild-type line the line was originally derived from. Female fecundity was determined by mating 100 virgin females of both the GCaMP6sâ+/+âand wild-type line to 50 wild-type males. Females were allowed to mate for 3Â days after eclosion and were given access to anesthetized mice for 15Â min on the 5th and 6th day after eclosion. Two days after blood feeding, single bloodfed females were individually captured into vials lined with moistened filter paper. Nonblood females were not collected. Bloodfed females were allowed 3Â days in the vials to oviposit their eggs and were removed on the third day. Oviposited eggs were then counted. To determine male fertility, 25 males of both strains were mated to 100 virgin wild-type females and the same procedure for calculating female fecundity was used. To test egg hatching rate, eggs from single pair crosses of GCaMP6sâ+/+â(â) X +/+â(â) and +/+â(â) X +/+â(â) were counted and hatched 4Â days after oviposited. Emerged larvae were then counted at the L2 stage. To calculate larvae to pupae development time, larvae of both strains were hatched and separate into 5 pans filled with 2.5L of water with 100 larvae per pan. The number of pupae emerged was counted everyday post hatching to estimate the number of days for larval developmental time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Immunofluorescence and GCaMP6s expression</title><p id="Par36">To determine GCaMP6sâ pattern of expression, whole larval brains were stained following a previously published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Brains were either stained with a mixture of rabbit anti-GFP (1:500, abcam) and either mouse anti-alpha tubulin (1:100, DHSB) or mouse anti-GS (1:200, BD Bio) as primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies used were Alexa-488 donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa-555 donkey anti-mouse (ThermoFisher). Images of stained brains were taken using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>: Figure S3). In addition, to examine the baseline fluorescence in different chemosensory cell types, processes (glia) and the lateral and medial cell bodies were recorded before and during odor stimulation and image planes were analyzed using k-means clustering. Based on this analysis, the ROI cell type clusters could be distinguished based on cell size alone, rather than differences in fluorescence (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par37">To compare response differences between individuals that differed by either genetic background or stimulus, we used a Welchâs t-test due to the unequal sample size. To compare latency between neural and muscle responses, we used a MannâWhitney U test which allows for analysis of non normalized distributions as well as ordinal data.A pairwise t-test was used to compare larval behavior during the acclimation phase of the experiment to the odor stimulation phase (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A 1-way ANOVA was used to compare overall behavioral differences across strains (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM14">14</xref>: Figure S7).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Christian Bowman for help with inverse PCR, Tjinder Grewal for assistance with larval behavior assays, Gabriella Wolff for her contribution of confocal images for Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the UCSD School of Medicine Microscopy Core, and David Kosman for his advice on immunostaining and confocal imaging for Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>: Figure S3.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authorsâ contributions</title><p>O.S.A and J.A.R conceived and designed the experiments.

Calcium responses were imaged in multiple tissues (A-E, <italic>left</italic>) at varying developmental stages. Frames were taken every 9Â s, starting at 0Â s (i) until 36s (v) (A-E, <italic>right</italic>). Calcium transients were seen in regions within the adult female maxillary palp (ROI 1,4) and labium (ROI 2,3) (A). The female adult antennae also exhibited calcium transients within the nodes (ROI 1,2) and internodes (ROI 3) of the antennal flagellum (B). Stochastic patterns of fluorescence were seen when looking at clusters of ommatidia (ROI 1â3) within the right adult compound eye (C). Calcium transients were also visualized throughout the 2nd instar larvae. For example, responses were recorded in the medial retractor muscles (ROI 1), brain (ROI 2), longitudinal muscles in the thorax (ROI 3), longitudinal muscles in the 3rd abdominal segment (ROI 4), and muscles and neurons in the 6th abdominal segment (ROI 5) (D). When imaging the dorsal side of the larval head, calcium transients were visible in the transverse retractor (ROI 1), optic lobe (ROI 2), medial retractor (ROI 3), and antennal lobe (ROI 4) (E).

GCaMP could be used to morphologically characterize diverse cell types including the volumes of individual glomeruli (A), (B) lateral cell cluster neurons (<italic>B1</italic>), volume of the PL2 glomerulus (<italic>B2</italic>), glia (<italic>B3</italic>), and medial cell cluster neurons (<italic>B4</italic>). (C) k-means clustering significantly identified (pâ&lt;â0.05) three distinct cell classes based on their cell sizes, rather than differences in GCaMP expression levels, such as those in the lateral cell cluster (blue, possibly reflecting local interneurons), cells in the medial cell cluster (green, possibly projection neurons), and glial-like blebs on the glomerular surface (yellow). Cells were imaged at baseline levels and during odor stimulation (darker dots). Soma in the medial cell cluster exhibited greater changes in calcium dynamics during odor stimulation compared to the other cell types. Shaded areas denote the confidence interval around each cluster. (D) Responses of the different cell types during odor stimulation. Small, glia-like processes (yellow) showed small changes in calcium (less than 5%) compared to the soma in the medial (green) and lateral (blue) cell clusters.

GCaMP6sâ+/+âmosquitos were mated to orco5â/â mosquitoes. Resulting individuals were mated to orco5â/â mosquitoes in a single pairwise cross for at least 8 generations and sequenced using Sanger Sequencing to confirm the presence of the <italic>orco</italic> gene (A). Mutations are indicated in red (B). GCaMP6s/+/+âmosquitos were crossed with Gr3â/â mosquitos. Individuals containing both GCaMP6s and Gr3â/â markers, dsRed/GFP transients and CFP respectively, were crossed in single pairwise matings for at least 8 generations to generate homozygous lines, individuals were then crossed to +/+âto confirm homozygosity by mendelian inheritance (C). All mosquito lines used were screened and sorted during the larval stage using a longpass-GFP and CFP filter to confirm OpIE-DsRed/GCaMP and CFP respectively (D).</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM14" xlink:title="Additional files"><media xlink:href="MediaObjects/12868_2019_511_MOESM14_ESM.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption xml:lang="en"><p><ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12868-019-0511-y" ext-link-type="url">Additional file 14: Figure S7:</ext-link> Larvae of different strains do not exhibit motility defects Prior to stimulation we found no differences in positional preference (A) or mean speed (B) between larvae of the mutant and wild-type backgrounds (1-way ANOVA by background, pâ&gt;â0.05).
