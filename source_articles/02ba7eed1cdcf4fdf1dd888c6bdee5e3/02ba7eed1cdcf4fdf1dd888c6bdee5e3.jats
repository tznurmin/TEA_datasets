Here, we aimed to develop and optimize a vaccine format utilizing a synthetic long peptide (SLP) containing the human papilloma virus 16 (HPV16) E7 antigen, with a centrally located defined MHC class I epitope, and evaluate its immunogenicity and efficacy in combination with various adjuvant formulations.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">E7<sub>31–73</sub> SLP was tested alone or in combination with toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR4, TLR7/8 and TLR9 agonists and formulated in oil-in-water (o/w) or water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions to determine a vaccine format inducing a robust CD8 T cell response in murine models.

Preclinical development in cancer vaccines has explored several formats that have been proven effective for such an immune outcome. This included DNA plasmid vaccination, dendritic cell (DC)-targeting molecules, whole cell vaccines derived from tumor cells or antigen-loaded DCs, stabilized RNA-based vaccines, and virally-vectored constructs derived from vaccinia, poxvirus, and adenovirus (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). Peptide-based cancer vaccines have also been under development for many years and vaccination with peptides alone can, at times, show some efficacy and limited tumor regression in pre-clinical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, long-lasting suppression of tumor growth has generally been shown to require the formulation of peptide-based vaccines with immune-enhancing adjuvants (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]).</p><p id="Par18">Several potent adjuvants have been developed from the class of compounds known as toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, which mimic pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or conserved pathogen-derived compounds, to activate the host innate immune response. Adjuvant comparison studies have identified synthetic TLR agonists that trigger TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 as promising adjuvant candidates for cancer vaccines as they mimic the RNA and DNA-based PAMPs dominant in viral challenges, which often lead to strong cytolytic CD8 T cell responses, critical for effective antitumor immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. TLR9 short oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) agonists are most conducive for formulation as they are easy to manufacture, exhibit strong potency in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and do not require special formulations to protect from degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Several adjuvanted peptide vaccines have been tested clinically and although peptide-specific CD8 T cell responses can be detected at low levels, substantial clinical efficacy has been limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These results may be due to suboptimal formulations using short peptides which lack antigen presenting cell (APC)-activating properties and adjuvants (e.g. Montanide) that are not engineered for favorable MHC class I cross-presentation or improved homing to the draining lymph node [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Here, we report that pairing CpG delivered in an o/w emulsion with a 43 amino acid Synthetic Long Peptide (SLP) derived from HPV16 E7 resulted in vigorous CD8 T cell responses characterized by cytokine multifunctionality, establishment of memory populations, and high cytolytic potential. This vaccine format was also curative in a TC-1 tumor model through day 120 and was protective against tumor re-challenge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>SLP synthesis</title><p id="Par20">SLPs for HPV16 E7 43 amino acid in length were designed so the immunodominant H-2D<sup>b</sup>-restricted epitope (RAHYNIVTF) was centrally located.

Additionally, splenocytes were washed and pulsed with either 1 μg/mL HPV16-E7 peptide pool (CFSE<sup>hi</sup>) or an irrelevant EBV-gp100 peptide pool (CFSE<sup>lo</sup>) for 1 h at 37 °C. Peptide pools were 15-mers overlapping by 11 covering the entire sequences of E7 and gp350 and synthesized by Anaspec. Both target cell populations were mixed together at a 1:1 ratio (confirmed by FACS), and 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> combined target cells in 200 μL were injected by tail vein injection into vaccinated mice. 4 h after cell transfer, recipient mice were sacrificed and spleens harvested. Single cell splenocytes were analyzed by FACS for presence of CFSE-positive target cells. Percent E7-specific killing was calculated by the following formula (1 – (CFSE<sup>hi</sup> / CFSE<sup>lo</sup>)) × 100.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>ELISpot</title><p id="Par25">The ELISpot assay was performed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], using the mouse IFN-γ ELISpot kit (BD Biosciences) per manufacturer’s instructions.

Sub-confluent cultured cells were harvested in 10 mM EDTA, washed, and resuspended in DMEM + 10 mM HEPES (Gibco) for injection. 2e4 viable TC-1 cells in a volume of 30 μL were implanted subcutaneously into the left hind footpad. Mice were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups at this point. Tumor growth was evaluated by direct measurement with calipers, beginning at day 10. Bi-directional measurements were collected every 2–4 days, and tumor volume calculated using the formula: volume = (length x width<sup>2</sup>)/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Mice were euthanized when the primary tumor exceeded 1000 mm<sup>3</sup> in accordance with ethical guidelines. For vaccination, 3–20 μg E7 SLP was formulated with 20 μg CpG ODN 2395 in AddaVax and PBS in a total volume of 100 μL. Vaccinations were administered s.c. into the ventral surface of the base of tail. At various time points after vaccination, spleens and/or tumor tissue were harvested from sacrificed mice (selections were randomized when subsets of vaccinated groups were euthanized), processed through GentleMACS, and analyzed for immune cell subsets by FACS. In some cases, mice were re-challenged with TC-1 tumor and implanted with 2e4, 5e4, or 1e5 TC-1 cells in the right footpad on day 120.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry</title><p id="Par27">Select tumor samples were collected via blunt dissection of footpad tissue, immersion-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 12–24 h, processed routinely, and embedded in paraffin.

We determined that pairing a tumor antigen peptide with CpG-C 2395 delivered in a squalene-based o/w emulsion was highly effective in promoting CD8 T cell responses in mice that were antigen-specific, long-lasting, multifunctional cytokine-expressing, and functionally cytolytic for target cells. This vaccine also proved particularly effective at conveying antitumor effects in the TC-1 tumor mouse model, greatly increasing survival, promoting tumor regression, and establishing a memory response that prevented tumor growth in animals re-challenged with higher doses of TC-1.</p><p id="Par39">The efficacy of CpG-adjuvanted vaccines to treat established tumors in mice has been reported by other investigators. CpG ODNs or motifs have been combined in many different vaccine formats including: DNA plasmid encoding HPV16-E7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], bacteriophage-derived VLPs coupled to Melan-A/MART-1 peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], lipoprotein-conjugated E7 antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and recombinant <italic>Bordetella</italic> adenylate cyclase bearing E7 polypeptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The presence of CpG has improved induction of cytolytic responses and/or tumor regression in each case. In a vaccine format more similar to that described herein, consisting of a 35-mer long peptide based on the HPV16 E7 RAHYNIVTF epitope formulated with CpG alone or with the w/o emulsion Montanide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], investigators reported full tumor regression of TC-1 flank tumors after two s.c. opposite flank vaccinations at days 10 and 24. However, long-lasting protective responses were not fully evaluated as tumor growth was only recorded up to day 30. Since we observed tumor outgrowth occurring in some vaccinated mice post-day 30, it is unclear whether their vaccination regimen was truly curative. The authors also used 150 μg E7 SLP, while we have found that a much lower dose of 20 μg is very effective if delivered with an o/w squalene-based emulsion formulation, and that this formulation generates CD8 T cell responses of greatly increased magnitude when directly compared to those induced with Montanide.</p><p id="Par40">W/o emulsions such as SEPPIC’s Montanide ISA51 and ISA720 have been used in multiple Phase I/II clinical trials and have shown some degree of efficacy, but also have shown safety signals at higher dose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, w/o emulsions like Montanide or IFA have been found to be suboptimal delivery systems for peptides in models of tumor vaccination as they are responsible for an antigen depot effect which causes CD8 T cells to home to the vaccination site rather than the tumor and to convert to an exhaustion phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On the other hand, pharmacology studies with o/w emulsions like MF59, the chemical composition of which the emulsion AddaVax used in our studies was based from, have demonstrated that the emulsion is rapidly drained away from the injection site and that the half-life of the antigen is not affected (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). MF59 has been shown to induce strong CD4 T cell responses and has been incorporated into some flu vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and recently o/w emulsions have been shown in animal models to generate strong cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses when paired with CpG against viral antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Combining TLR agonists with an emulsion delivery vehicle is thought to increase the stability of the agonist as well as to improve antigen uptake and activation of APCs. The improved activity of TLR agonists by incorporation into a squalene-based o/w emulsion formulation has been demonstrated unequivocally with TLR4L. Prominent among this class of adjuvants is GLA-SE, in which the synthetic TLR4 agonist glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA) is incorporated during the microfluidization process into the resultant squalene-based stable emulsion (SE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. GLA-SE demonstrates clear superiority over GLA delivered either with aluminum salts or in aqueous-soluble micelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A more limited data set has indicated that CpG combined with emulsion may also show enhanced efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In line with these findings, we found that the equivalent dose of CpG without emulsion is less efficient in the induction of CD8 T cell responses than CpG + o/w emulsion, providing further support for the use of this adjuvant combination. A recent report by Song et al. demonstrated the improved efficacy of CpG when delivered by the novel w/o squalene emulsion PELC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. E7 peptide delivered by CpG/PELC resulted in higher E7-specific CD8 T cell induction, in vivo cytolytic activity, and protection in a TC-1 model through day 50, compared to peptide plus either adjuvant components alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The formulation used in the study was the H-2Db minimal determinant of E7 rather than the SLP, which likely accounts for why we observed higher magnitude CD8 T cell IFN-γ expression, higher cytolytic function, and full protection through day 130 in our study as we demonstrate that the increased ability of SLP to drive CD8 T cell responses when compared to minimal peptides.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">Peptide vaccines targeting cancer have not achieved the desired clinical endpoints of robust and broad CTL effects and vigorous antineoplastic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Much of this lack of success may be due to suboptimal adjuvant formulations (e.g. Montanide, GM-CSF) and antigen formats that cannot initiate the cross-presentation process in DCs that is vital for the promotion of robust CTL responses critical for antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].
