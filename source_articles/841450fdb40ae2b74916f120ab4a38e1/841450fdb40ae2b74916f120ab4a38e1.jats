However, the antitumor effect of these ginsenosides and the mechanism of PPD remain unclear. In this work, the antitumor effects of several derivatives, including PPD, Rg5, Rg3, Rh2, and Rh3, were evaluated in five different cancer cell lines. PPD demonstrated the best inhibitory effects on the proliferation and migration of the five cancer cell lines, especially the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Therefore, the mechanism of action of PPD in HCC cells was elucidated. PPD inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot and immunofluorescence assay showed that PPD can alter the expression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition markers, increase E-cadherin expression, and decrease vimentin expression. Docking and biacore experiments revealed that STAT3 is the target protein of PPD, which formed hydrogen bonds with Gly583/Leu608/Tyr674 at the SH2 domain of STAT3. PPD inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 and its translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, thereby inhibiting the expression of Twist1. PPD also inhibited tumor volume and tumor lung metastasis in PLC/PRF/5 xenograft model. In conclusion, PPD can inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells through the STAT3/Twist1 pathway.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant 2018YFA0507203]</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 81871972]</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Funds of China 81703581</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41419_2019_Article_1733.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemistry, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Cell Biology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Immunology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Cell Culture</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Antibodies</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="AuthorContribution"><p>These authors contributed equally: Lan Yang, Xue-ying Zhang, Kun Li, An-ping Li, Wen-dong Yang</p></notes><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>Edited by S.

The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) process is associated with dramatic changes in cellular morphology and has been considered a mechanism that leads to tumor metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The EMT plays a crucial role in human liver cancer and is associated with tumor invasion, intrahepatic metastasis, and poor prognosis.

These ginsenosides are mainly divided into diol- and triol-type ginsenosides. To date, 100 types of ginsenoside compounds have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

Meanwhile, PPD shows an excellent therapeutic effect on HCC cancer. The effect of PPD on the EMT of HCC cells was also studied. Matrigel-coated transwell chambers were used for the testing of the invasion ability of the PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells after administration and investigating the ability of PPD to inhibit the invasion of both cell lines. The PPD inhibited the invasive ability of PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Then, the effect of PPD on the cloning ability of HCC cells was explored. The results of colony formation showed that the cell cloning ability was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). E-cadherin and vimentin are EMT markers. The PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells were treated with different doses of PPD for 24 h. Subsequently, E-cadherin and vimentin were immunofluorescent double stained to observe the fluorescence intensity. The expression levels of vimentin were decreased and E-cadherin were increased by PPD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We also detected the expression level of EMT-related marker VE-cadherin. PPD can inhibit the expression of VE-cadherin dose-dependently (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). The morphological changes were further characterized with optical and scanning electron microscopes.

Molecular docking was performed, and the docking score was calculated by Schrodinger software. The predicted STAT3 targets were docked with PPD, and the target with a high docking score was selected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The active sites of PPD and STAT3 dimer (protein structure information was obtained from protein data bank entry 1BG1) were examined by combining points through molecular docking. PPD formed hydrogen bonds with Gly583/Leu608/Tyr674 at the SH2 domain of STAT3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). We then performed a biacore experiment. PPD directly binds to STAT3 in a concentration-dependent manner and has micromolar binding affinity (KD = 2.68e−5 M; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). STAT3 can be involved in the regulation of apoptosis, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. We further used immunofluorescence and western blot experiments to verify the ability of PPD to affect STAT3 nuclear translocation, considering that nuclear translocation is the core of transcription factor function. In the PPD treatment, STAT3 was inhibited from shifting to the nucleus of the HCC cells (PLC/PRF/5; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). In the western blot experiment, PLC/PRF/5 cell was exposed to PPD for 48 h. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of PPD-treated or untreated cells were prepared with a Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent Kit. After the PPD treatment, the nuclear expression of p-STAT3 decreased in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). To verify the effect of PPD on STAT3 pathway, we further determined the effects of PPD on the migration and invasion of STAT3 knockdown PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells. Wound-healing and invasion experiments showed that the migration and invasion ability were decreased in STAT3 knockdown PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells. PPD had no significant effect on the migration and invasion ability of STAT3 knockdown PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f, g</xref>). The constitutive activation of STAT3 promoted the expression of Twist1. Thus, we tested the expression of Twist1 in the PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells.

We determined the effect of 48 h treatments using PPD, OXA, or both with an MTT assay. PPD and OXA diminished cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. PPD enhanced the inhibitory effects of OXA on HCC cell proliferation. Compusyn software analysis showed that the combination index (CI) value of the combined treatment group was &lt;1 at different doses, that is, a synergistic effect is present between PPD and OXA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In the wound healing assay, the migration ability of cells treated with OXA alone increased after 24 and 48 h of treatment, thereby indicating that OXA promotes the migration of HCC cells. The wound gap was wide in the combined treatment groups. Thus, the combined treatment inhibited the motility of HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The PLC/PRF/5 cells were seeded into BALB/C nude mice for the investigation of the in vivo antitumor effect of PPD.
