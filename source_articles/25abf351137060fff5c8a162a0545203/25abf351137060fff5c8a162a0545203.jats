To better understand H7N9 pathogenesis in relation to monocyte cell death, we showed here that extensive phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein occurred concurrently with the activation of caspases-8, -9 and -3 in H7N9-infected monocytes at 6 h post infection (hpi), indicating that apoptosis and necroptosis pathways were simultaneously activated. The apoptotic morphology was readily observed in H7N9-infected monocytes with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while the pan-caspase inhibitor, IDN6556 (IDN), accelerated cell death through necroptosis as evidenced by the increased level of pMLKL accompanied with cell swelling and plasma membrane rupture. Most importantly, H7N9-induced cell death could only be stopped by the combined treatment of IDN and necrosulfonamide (NSA), a pMLKL membrane translocation inhibitor, but not by individual inhibition of caspase or RIPK3. Our data further showed that activation of apoptosis and necroptosis pathways in monocytes differentially contributed to the immune response of monocytes upon H7N9 infection. Specifically, caspase inhibition significantly enhanced, while RIPK3 inhibition reduced the early expression of type I interferons and cytokine/chemokines in H7N9-infected monocytes. Moreover, culture supernatants from IDN-treated H7N9-infected monocyte promoted the expression of co-stimulatory molecule CD80, CD83 and CD86 on freshly isolated monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDCs) and enhanced the capacity of MDCs to induce CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation in vitro. In contrast, these immune stimulatory effects were abrogated by using culture supernatants from H7N9-infected monocyte with RIPK3 inhibition. In conclusion, our findings indicated that H7N9 infection activated both apoptosis and necroptosis in monocytes. An intact RIPK3 activity is required for upregulation of innate immune responses, while caspase activation suppresses the immune response.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>This work was partly supported by the donations of the Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Richard Yu and Carol Yu, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, and Chan Yin Chuen Memorial Charitable Foundation, and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases of the Ministry of Education of China.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>25</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41419_2019_Article_1684.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemistry, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Cell Biology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Immunology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Cell Culture</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Antibodies</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="AuthorContribution"><p>These authors contributed equally: Andrew C.Y.

Viral proteins including PB1-F2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, NP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and NS1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> trigger apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway by mitochondrial-dependent activation of caspase-9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. At the same time, virus-induced cytokines, for instance Fas/FasL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> activate extrinsic apoptosis through death receptor/ligand-mediated caspase-8 activation. Influenza virus infection also leads to necroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis. Necroptosis depends on the formation and activation of necrosome, which consists of receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1), -3 (RIPK3), and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Activation of RIPK1/RIPK3 leads to the phosphorylation of MLKL, which translocates to plasma membrane causing membrane permeabilization and cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A recent study showed that influenza H1N1(A/Puerto Rico/8/34, PR8/H1N1) induces necroptosis in murine fibroblast through the detection of viral RNA with the intracellular immune sensor, Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), and subsequent activation of RIPK3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. PR8/H1N1 viral protein NP and PB1 have also been reported to interact with ZBP1 to activate RIPK3-dependent necroptosis in fibroblast and bone marrow-derived macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Apoptosis is a host defense mechanism that can control virus replication. By shrinking apoptotic cells and forming apoptotic bodies, apoptosis restrains inflammatory responses and limits tissue damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, necroptosis causes cell membrane bursting and releases intracellular contents known as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that promote inflammation and trigger the anti-viral immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In this sense, sustainable apoptosis is non-immunogenic, while necroptosis is an immunogenic form of cell death. However, excessive cell death, even in the form of apoptosis, could lead to the destruction of respiratory tissue structure and promote severe inflammatory damages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Previous studies indicated that the degree of influenza virus-induced cell death is virus strain and cell type dependent. Specifically, H1N1 and H3N2 viruses activated necroptosis and apoptosis pathways in parallel in fibroblasts and epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, seasonal H1N1 viruses induced, while A(H1N1)pdm09 suppressed RIPK3-mediated necroptosis in dendritic cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Avian influenza A H7N9 virus is highly pathogenic to human, which causes severe viral pneumonia with case fatality approximately 40%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Excessive production of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine is believed to play key roles in the pathogenesis of H7N9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We and others previously demonstrated that the high lethality of H7N9 infection in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and in humans case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> had significantly reduced serum neutralizing antibody titer which indicated a weakened adaptive immune response to H7N9 infection. However, the interplay between H7N9 infection, cell death, and immune response is not fully understood. H7N9 induced apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and alveolar epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Similarly, we previously demonstrated that H7N9 effectively infected human CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and induced massive apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, which might partly explain the weakened adaptive immune responses. However, whether H7N9 virus induces necroptosis in human monocytes and if necroptosis modulates immune responses or pathogenesis in H7N9 infection remain unexplored. Here we report that H7N9 concurrently activates apoptosis and necroptosis pathways that result in massive CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte cell death. In addition to cell death, activation of RIPK3 in monocytes upregulates the innate immune responses, while activation of caspase activities restrains these responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Virus and reagents</title><p id="Par5">The A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus was propagated in 10-day-old specific pathogen-free chicken embryos.

Our results showed that all three inhibitors suppressed caspase-3 cleavage at 12 and 24 hpi (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), but failed to improve the viability of the infected monocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

By Western blot detection, the amount of cleaved caspase-3, -8 and -9 were largely diminished by IDN treatment at 3, 6 and 12hpi (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Together with the significant reduction of TUNEL positive cells at 12hpi (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), these data indicated that IDN treatment effectively inhibited apoptosis in H7N9-infected monocytes.

We detected quick upregulation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 mRNA in H7N9-infected monocytes from 6hpi onward (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). However, the protein level of RIPK1 was decreased upon infection while the amount of RIPK3 protein was increase at 3hpi and decreased at 12hpi when compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation using RIPK3 as the bait showed an increased amount of RIPK1 and MLKL protein from H7N9-infected monocyte lysate at 3 and 6hpi (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). At the same time, we detected a gradually increased level of phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL), an effector protein inducing necroptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). These results suggested that H7N9 infection activated RIPK1/3 and the necroptosis pathway. As a positive control, TCZ (TNF-α [20 ng/ml], cycloheximide [250 ng/ml], and z-VAD-FMK [20 µM]) treatment significantly upregulated pMLKL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) and reduced cell viability in monocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), which confirmed that human primary monocytes supported necroptosis in vitro. We next examined the effect of necroptosis inhibitors on H7N9-induced cell death. The results showed that individual treatment with RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 (NEC-1), RIPK3 inhibitors (GSK’872 + GSK’843; GSKs), or pMLKL membrane translocation inhibitor, necrosulfonamide (NSA), did not improve the viability of H7N9-infected monocytes at 12 and 24hpi despite they significantly inhibited TCZ-induced necroptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

We found that IDN increased the concentration of pMLKL at 3 and 6hpi (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Meanwhile, TEM images of IDN-treated H7N9-infected monocytes at 12hpi showed cell swelling and plasma membrane bursting (arrowheads), indicating necrotic cell death (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, right panels). Furthermore, the combined treatment of IDN and NSA protected cell viability to 100%, 81.7% and 48.1% at 12, 24 and 48hpi, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). This was further supported by TEM, as similar cell morphologies were observed between IDN + NSA-treated H7N9-infected monocytes and mock-infected cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).

In addition, our data suggested that in the presence of IDN treatment, NEC-1 or GSKs could no longer effectively inhibit MLKL phosphorylation and did not improve cell viability. This may be due to the elevated activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3 upon caspase inhibition (data not shown).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Pan-caspase inhibitor IDN treatment increased pMLKL and switched H7N9-infected monocytes to necroptosis.</title><p>Monocytes inoculated with A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus at MOI of 2, after 1 h viral absorption at 37 °C, IDN or IDN combined with NSA (IDN 10 µM + NSA 5 µM) were added to the culture.

To elucidate how the concurrent activation of apoptosis and necroptosis pathways regulates immune response of monocytes in H7N9 infection, we first investigated the expression of cytokine and chemokine upon apoptosis or necroptosis modulation. As demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, pan-caspase inhibition by IDN increased the early responses of <italic>IFNA/B</italic>, proinflammatory cytokine (<italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>TNFA</italic>), and chemokine (<italic>MIP1A/B</italic> and <italic>RANTES</italic>) at 6hpi. IDN treatment also increased the expression of GM-CSF and co-stimulatory molecule CD80 in H7N9-infected monocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In contrast, inhibition of RIPK3 by kinase inhibitor GSKs significantly reduced the expression of <italic>IL1B</italic> and substantially reduced the expression of <italic>IFNA/B, IL6, TNFA, MIP1A/B</italic>, <italic>RANTES</italic>, GM-CSF and CD80 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This data suggested the early innate immune responses required RIPK3 kinase activity, while caspase activities suppressed H7N9-induced immune response in monocytes. IDN, GSKs, or NSA treatment alone or in combination showed no toxicity to mock-infected monocytes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S2a</xref>) and did not impact cytokine expression in mock-infected monocytes except for slight induction of <italic>MIP1A</italic> and <italic>MIP1B</italic> gene by IDN treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">S2b</xref>). Next, we studied how H7N9-infected monocytes may affect the bystander uninfected monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDCs). Culture supernatants from H7N9- and mock-infected monocytes with or without treatment were collected (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">S3</xref>a, b) and added to freshly purified monocytes after UV-inactivation of the virus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, upper illustration). 72 h later, flow cytometry analysis of the monocytes demonstrated that the culture supernatant from H7N9-infected monocytes with IDN treatment significantly increased the expression of co-stimulatory molecule CD80, CD83 and CD86 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Similar experiments on MDCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>, upper illustration) showed that culture supernatant from H7N9-infected monocytes with IDN treatment similarly augmented the expression of CD80, CD83 and CD86 in MDCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). In contrast, GSKs-treatment lowered the expression of CD80, CD83, and CD86 in MDCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). As a positive control, LPS (100 ng/ml) induced significantly higher level of CD83 and CD86 in MDCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">S4a</xref>).

In this study, we demonstrated that avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection of human monocytes concurrently activated apoptosis and necroptosis.

TUNEL labeling, activation of caspase-3 and TEM images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> indicated activation of apoptosis activation. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 cleavage, upregulation of death receptors and ligands, as well as the increased expression of PUMA and NOXA collectively suggested that both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways were activated. This is consistent with previous studies of other subtypes of influenza virus in which viral proteins and inflammatory cytokines induced apoptosis through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. On the other hand, upregulation of RIPK1/RIPK3 expression, interaction between RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL, and the phosphorylation of MLKL indicated necroptosis activation in parallel with apoptosis. This finding is in line with previous studies that demonstrated influenza H1N1 and H3N2 viruses simultaneously activate apoptosis and necroptosis pathways in infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">In PR8/H1N1-infected macrophage THP-1 cell line, pMLKL was only detected when the cells were treated with pan-caspase inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

In the current study, we demonstrated that despite the protein levels of RIPK1 and RIPK3 were decreased at 12hpi, phosphorylation of MLKL was evident upon H7N9 infection. This finding implied that the activated caspase-8 activity did not completely suppress RIPK1/3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and simultaneous apoptosis and necroptosis were triggered in H7N9-infected monocytes. Interestingly, an apoptotic morphology was more readily detected among the H7N9-infected monocytes under TEM.

However, Xu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> demonstrated that RIPK3-mediated inflammatory response contributed to disease severity and lethality in H7N9-infected mice. The mechanism was independent of necroptosis, but rather through caspase-1/IL-1β signaling-mediated overproduction of cytokine/chemokine and heightened inflammatory infiltration in lung tissue.
