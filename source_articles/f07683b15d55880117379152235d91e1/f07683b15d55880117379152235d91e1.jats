As the sensitivity of only a few tumors to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can be explained by the presence of EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) domain mutations, there is a need to elucidate mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in OS that do not harbor TK sensitizing mutations to develop new strategies to circumvent resistance to EGFR inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">As a measure of the characters of OSCs, serum-free cultivation, cell viability test with erlotinib, and serial transplantation in vivo was used. Western blot assays were used to detect the association between erlotinib resistance and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression. By using TaqMan qPCR miRNA array, online prediction software, luciferase reporter assays and western blot analysis, we further elucidated the mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Here, CD166<sup>+</sup> cells are found in 10 out of 10 tumor samples. We characterize that CD166<sup>+</sup> cells from primary OS tissues bear hallmarks of OSCs and erlotinib-resistance. TGFβ-induced EMT-associated kinase switch is demonstrated to promote erlotinib-resistance of CD166<sup>+</sup> OSCs. Further mechanisms study show that TGFβ-induced EMT decreases miR-499a expression through the direct binding of Snail1/Zeb1 to miR-499a promoter. Overexpression of miR-499a in CD166<sup>+</sup> OSCs inhibits TGFβ-induced erlotinib-resistance in vitro and in vivo. SHKBP1, the direct target of miR-499a, regulates EGFR activity reduction occurring concomitantly with a TGFβ-induced EMT-associated kinase switch to an AKT-activated EGFR-independent state. TGFβ-induced activation of AKT co-opts an increased SHKBP1 expression, which further regulates EGFR activity. In clinic, the ratio of the expression levels of SHKBP1 and miR-499a is highly correlated with EMT and resistance to erlotinib.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">TGFβ–miR-499a–SHKBP1 network orchestrates the EMT-associated kinase switch that induces resistance to EGFR inhibitors in CD166<sup>+</sup> OSCs, implies that inhibition of TGFβ induced EMT-associated kinase switch may reverse the chemo-resistance of OSCs to EGFR inhibitors. We also suggest that an elevated SHKBP1/miR-499a ratio is a molecular signature that characterizes the erlotinib-resistant OS, which may have clinical value as a predictive

frequent form of primary bone tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The drug resistance induced recurrence and metastasis remarkably contribute to the failure in OS therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A rising number of observations indicates that cancer stem cells (CSCs), characterized by increased tumorigenicity, self-renewal ability and multipotency, have been described contributing to tumor progression and resistance to chemo-therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In OS, existence of osteosarcoma stem cell-like cells (OSCs) may explain the high rate of tumor relapse after standard therapies. Zhang W. et, al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] showed that OSCs results in a critical advantage when establishing lung macro-metastases. Crasto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] used disulfiram as an ALDH inhibitor to target the CSC subpopulation in a murine osteosarcoma model. They found that a reduction in metastatic tumor burden after treatment, which was comparable to that achieved with doxorubicin chemotherapy. Therefore, therapeutics targeting OSCs may be an effective strategy to overcome chemo-resistance and preventing distant metastasis.</p><p id="Par6">As the heterogeneity of osteosarcoma, rather than targeting OS cells themselves, targeting the key actors secreted in the microenvironment, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), supplies an alternative approach to overcome OSCs. Studies have shown that overexpression of TGFβ is a hallmark of many cancers, including OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In OS, increase TGFβ level is associated with high-grade and metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, studies demonstrated that TGFβ triggered epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor-initiating cell stemness, metastasis and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, few studies uncovering the molecular mechanism underlying TGFβ-induced EMT to affect the chemo-resistance of OSCs.</p><p id="Par7">The resistance or sensitivity of some tumors to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors can be explained by the presence of mutations in the EGFR TK domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, such mutations are rare in tumors other than non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, there is an urgent need to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to EGFR-targeted TKIs to provide treatment selectively to those patients who do not harbor EGFR mutations but will nonetheless respond to TKIs. In OS, EGFR has been found to be overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and in vitro studies have reported the expression of EGFR as well as effective inhibition of OS growth by EGFR inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but few activating mutations in the EGFR TK domain in OS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. At the meantime, epithelial tumor cells are more sensitive to EGFR inhibitors than tumor cells that acquired mesenchymal characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In multiple types of tumors, like OS, the response to EGFR-targeted agents is inversely correlated with EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It suggests that OSCs and EMT are the common denominator resistant to EGFR inhibitors. Nevertheless, the precise molecular link between EMT and EGFR inhibitors in OSCs remain unknown.</p><p id="Par8">Here, CD166<sup>+</sup> cells are found in 10 out of 10 tumor samples.

In OS, studies demonstrated that TGFβs expression were enhanced, and TGFβs affected OS growth and lung metastatic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], suggesting that TGFβ plays a pro-tumoral effect in OS. Nevertheless, the downstream mechanism underlying TGFβ-induced EMT in OS is unclear. In this study, we found that, in CD166<sup>+</sup> OSCs, TGFβ expression level was increased. TGFβ induced CD166<sup>−</sup> cells to undergo an EMT-associated kinase switch that renders them resistant to EGFR TKIs, which suggests that increased autocrine exposure to TGFβ may be a driving force behind the erlotinib-resistant phenotype.</p><p id="Par38">Accumulated studies uncovered that miR-499a was decreased in several cancers, including pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and oral squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], functioning as the tumor suppressor. In OS, it was found inhibiting OS cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], however, the biological function and underlying mechanisms of miR-499a in OSCs was unclear. In this study, by characterizing the down-stream mechanisms of TGFβ-induced EMT in OS, we found that miR-499a was significantly reduced upon TGFβ treatment. Further mechanisms study defined that EMT factors, Snail1 and Zeb1, bound to the miR-499a promoters directly and regulated miR-499a at transcriptional level. As for its downstream signaling pathway, miR-499a was found targeting SHKBP1. Studies showed that compared with healthy individual’s serum, SHKBP1 protein expression in the serum of patients with lymph node metastasis and liver metastasis was significantly elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], but studies on the regulating mechanisms SHKBP1 is few. Here, we unveiled that TGFβ-induced EMT in CD166<sup>+</sup> OSCs results in decreased miR-499a and enhaced SHKBP1 expression level. As EGFR-independent activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway has frequently been seen in cells that develop resistance and is thought to confer resistance to EGFR TKIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we further sought here that EMT-associated PI3K-AKT pathway co-opts to regulate the basal expression level of SHKBP1 in CD166<sup>+</sup> OSCs. As for the downstream of SHKBP1, our data indicated that SHKBP1 regulated EGFR activity to lead to further EGFR TKIs resistance. Recently, Lifeng Feng, et, al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] found that SHKBP1 affected EGFR signaling that required at least one intact PXXXPR motif, which gives the insight of the possible molecular mechanisms of SHKBP1 in EGFR activity regulation. Therefore, TGFβ-mediated suppression of the miR-499a unleashes expression of SHKBP1, which in turn quenches EGFR activity. The elevation of SHKBP1 following TGFβ-induced EMT is sustained by EGFR-independent activation of AKT because this is reduced by PI3K inhibitors, but not by erlotinib.</p><p id="Par39">In clinic, SHKBP1 expression level was found increased in OS samples compared with that in their adjacent normal counterparts. Meanwhile, SHKBP1 was negatively correlated with miR-499a level in CD166<sup>+</sup> OSCs and corresponding CD166<sup>−</sup> cells. Further xenografts assays showed that a high SHKBP1/miR-499a ratio tended to increased resistance to erlotinib. These results indicate that an elevated SHKBP1/miR-499a ratio may have clinical value as a predictive biomarker to characterize the erlotinib-resistant OS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par40">In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the TGFβ– miR-499a –SHKBP1 network orchestrates the EMT-associated kinase switch that induces resistance to EGFR TKIs in OSCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We also suggest that an elevated SHKBP1/miR-499a ratio is a molecular signature that characterizes the erlotinib-resistant OS, which may have clinical value as a predictive biomarker. Our data further suggest that inhibition of the molecular determinants of the EMT-associated kinase switch, here is TGFβ, may reverse the chemo-resistance of OSCs to EGFR inhibitors.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Evolution of erlotinib resistance in CD166<sup>+</sup> OSCs</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13046_2019_1195_Fig8_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></p></fig></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>This work is supported by Medical Peak Discipline Construction Project of Xuhui District (grant number: 15303) and Medical Science and Technology Project of Xuhui District (grant number: SHXH201709).</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p id="Par54">TW and DW: contribution to the conception or design of the work; the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; LZ, PY, JW, QL and FY: Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; FL: Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
