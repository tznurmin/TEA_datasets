Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) regulates mitochondrial fission, which is an important part of MQC. Retinoblastoma (RB) protein can regulate MQC in a transcription-independent manner. Necroptosis plays a critical role in hepatic pathologies such as inflammatory, infectious, and xenobiotics-induced injury and diseases. We aimed to explore the role and mechanism of Drp1 interaction with RB in hepatocyte’s necroptosis caused by cadmium (Cd). CdCl<sub>2</sub> was employed to expose to Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice and human hepatic L02 cells. CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure induced necroptosis and hepatic injury both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, Drp1 and RB protein were up-regulated and translocated to mitochondria in CdCl<sub>2</sub>-exposed hepatocytes. Inhibition of Drp1 with siRNA (si<italic>DNM1L</italic>) or inhibitors not only suppressed the RB expression and its mitochondrial translocation, but also alleviated MQC disorder, necroptosis, and hepatotoxicity caused by CdCl<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, blocking Drp1 with metformin rescued necroptosis and hepatic injury triggered by CdCl<sub>2</sub>. RB was proved to directly interact with Drp1 at mitochondria to form a complex which then bound to receptor interaction protein kinase (RIPK3) and enhanced the formation of necrosome after CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure. In summary, we found a new molecular mechanism of regulated cell death that Drp1 interacted with RB and promoted them mitochondrial translocation to mediate necroptosis and hepatic injury in hepatocytes induced by Cd-exposure. The mitochondrial Drp1-RB axis would be a novel target for the protection cells from xenobiotics triggering hepatic injury and diseases involved in necroptosis.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of

These receptor systems often trigger downstream key proteins, including receptor interaction protein kinase (RIPK) 1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain like (MLKL) protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Specifically, once RIPK1 recruits and activates RIPK3 through RIPK homotypic interaction motif, RIPK3 will phosphorylate MLKL (p-MLKL) at the threonine 357 (Thr357) and serine 358 (Ser358) sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, leading to exposure of the N-terminal four helical bundle domain, which finally binds to phosphatidylinositol lipids and cardiolipin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This feature allows the transfer of MLKL from cytosol to cell plasma membrane and organelles’ membranes, where it directly disrupts membrane integrity, releases damage-associated molecular patterns, and results in necroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Besides the phosphorylation regulatory mechanism, we aimed to explore other molecular events that might regulate the execution of necroptosis.</p><p id="Par3">Recent studies have shown that necroptosis plays a critical role in human pathologies including many inflammatory, degenerative, and infectious diseases, especially in xenobiotics-induced liver injury and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The expression of RIPK3 is higher in the liver of patients with alcoholic liver disease than that of normal people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, RIPK3-deficient mice present less hepatitis, liver injury, and steatosis after alcohol administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. On the other hand, necroptosis-related diseases can be triggered by xenobiotics exposure, such as cigarette smoking, nanomaterials, and environmental heavy metal pollutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For example, cadmium (Cd) increases the mRNA levels of <italic>RIPK1</italic> and <italic>MLKL</italic> in chicken cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and induces necroptosis in rainbow trout cells derived from gill<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Cd and its compounds (Cd<sup>2+</sup>) are common heavy metal contaminant, mainly from industrial productions, such as mining, alloy manufacturing, electroplating, and rechargeable batteries. Human Cd exposure mainly comes from environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Diet and lifestyle are primarily exposure pathways, such as drinking Cd-containing water and inhalation of cigarette smoking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Liver is one of the main targeted organs for acute or chronic Cd exposure. Many studies reported that Cd could induce autophagy, apoptosis, and necrosis in hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, it is still obscure whether Cd can induce necroptosis in hepatocytes or not and its mechanisms involved in mitochondrial quality control (MQC) remain to be clarified.</p><p id="Par4">MQC is extremely important for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through autophagy, mitochondria-related proteins distribution, and mitochondrial dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Mitochondrial dynamics, including mitochondrial fusion and fission, is regulated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), mitofusin (Mfn) 1 and Mfn2, and other factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Once damage is irreversible, mitochondria will present excessive fission, fragmentation, mass decline, and membrane integrity loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Drp1, encoded by <italic>DNM1L</italic> gene, is a cytosolic protein that can be recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) by interacting with mitochondrial receptor proteins (e.g., mitochondrial fission factor and fission protein 1) to mediate mitochondrial fission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Interestingly, many studies have reported that the necroptosis-related proteins are located at mitochondria and interact with Drp1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Wang found that mitochondrial damage preceded necroptosis occurrence and RIPK1/RIPK3 complex directly phosphorylated Drp1 at serine 616 site (p-Drp1<sup>(Ser616)</sup>) and triggered its translocation to mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. P-MLKL also could be translocated to mitochondrial membrane when necroptosis occurred in human colon cancer HT-29 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These studies suggest that MQC, regulated by Drp1, might be an intermediate event of necroptosis.</p><p id="Par5">Retinoblastoma (RB) protein, encoded by <italic>RB1</italic> gene, is a transcriptional co-regulator in many cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Its mechanisms are mainly divided into transcription-dependent and -independent manners. The nuclear RB generally binds to E2F transcription factor 1 to block cell cycle, leading to decrease of proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. On the other hand, RB is also located at cytoplasm and can be translocated to mitochondria to exert some transcription–independent functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. For example, RB promotes mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and oxidative phosphorylation, which can be blocked by RB mutation at serine 807/811 sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. RB also regulates the mitochondrial protein expression and redox status, both of which are important for mitochondrial homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In current study, human immortalized hepatic L02 cell line and Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice (one of the commonly available outbred population because they have good reproductive performance, are inexpensive, robust, and grow rapidly, and have been widely used in various research fields including toxicology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> were treated by CdCl<sub>2</sub> both in vitro and in vivo, respectively.

The body weight of mice in the CdCl<sub>2</sub> group had significant reduction from the fourth day compared to Ctrl group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, incomplete hepatic cord and vacuolation of mice liver were observed in the CdCl<sub>2</sub> group using HE staining. Furthermore, necroptosis-related proteins were detected using Western blot and IHC analyses. Compared to Ctrl group, the protein levels of RIPK3 and p-MLKL were increased, while the RIPK1 was decreased in the CdCl<sub>2</sub> group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).

At the beginning, we tested whether L02 cells went through necroptosis or not. TNF-α plus pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD is a well-known inducer of necroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1a</xref>, we found that necroptosis could be induced by TNF-α plus z-VAD in L02 cells. CdCl<sub>2</sub> induced p-MLKL up-regulation was inhibited by MLKL protein inhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) plus z-VAD (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1b</xref>). The cell viability had no significant change when cells were treated with CdCl<sub>2</sub> plus either z-VAD or NSA compared to CdCl<sub>2</sub> group. The necroptosis induced by CdCl<sub>2</sub> was inhibited only by NSA plus z-VAD (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1c</xref>). When MLKL translocates to cell membrane, the intracellular osmotic pressure will increase, and ultimately leading to membrane rupture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. As expected, the release rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), and the levels of RIPK3 and p-MLKL proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) were elevated and the content of ATP was reduced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) by CdCl<sub>2</sub> in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistently, CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure resulted in the decrease of ATP and the increase of RIPK3 and p-MLKL proteins in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2a, b</xref>). RIPK1, however, presented a downtrend which was in line with the result (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2b</xref>). The reason of RIPK1 were decreased by CdCl<sub>2</sub> might be that reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused RIPK1 oxidation to form intermolecular disulfide bonds, resulting in that RIPK1 could not be detected in β-mercaptoethanol-denatured proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Immunofluorescence (IF) assay showed that the fluorescence puncta of RIPK1 and RIPK3 were up-regulated by CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>). Moreover, we observed the typical features of necroptosis, including mitochondrial swelling, rupture of membranes, and cellular content release, by transmission electron microscope (TEM) in the CdCl<sub>2</sub> group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). To further explore the relationship of mitochondria with necroptosis caused by CdCl<sub>2</sub>, the co-localization of p-MLKL with mitochondrial membrane, IF staining of p-MLKL and TOM20 (a marker for MOM) was conducted.

In the present study, we found a new mechanism of CdCl<sub>2</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity associated with necroptosis and its regulatory mechanism of Drp1-RB axis. Our study exhibited that CdCl<sub>2</sub> caused the hepatic necroptosis and related liver injury both in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, MQC disorder with mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive fragmentation was proved to be mediated by mitochondrial Drp1 up-regulation, which led to necroptosis in CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated mice and hepatic cells. Besides, RB protein was induced and translocated to mitochondria to interact with Drp1 after CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure, which promoted the formation of necrosome harbored at mitochondria. Furthermore, metformin was employed to inhibit Drp1-RB axis, which attenuated hepatic necroptosis and related liver injury triggered by CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure in mice. Most importantly, we, for the first time, demonstrated that CdCl<sub>2</sub>-induced necroptosis and hepatotoxicity were regulated by Drp1-RB axis and intervention of this axis would be a potential valuable strategy to prevent xenobiotics-induced necroptosis and hepatotoxicity.</p><p id="Par16">MQC is tightly linked to CdCl<sub>2</sub>-caused hepatic injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, which was reported to be regulated by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and autophagy previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Our results also validated that CdCl<sub>2</sub> induced excessive mitochondrial fssion and mitoROS, loss of Δψm, and decrease of ATP production. Moreover, Pi et al reported that Drp1 mediated-mitochondrial fission and other mitochondrial damages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Consistently, we also demonstrated that Drp1 was up-regulated by CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure and blocking Drp1 rescued mitochondrial dysfunction, hepatic necroptosis, and liver injury. Moreover, we illuminated that Drp1 up-regulation was related with the MQC disorder contributed to CdCl<sub>2</sub>-induced necroptosis and hepatotoxicity.</p><p id="Par17">As one of the most common heavy metal pollutants, CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure can result in necrosis-like cell death in a variety of cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. For example, CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure lead to necroptosis of human lung L929 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Necroptosis is characterized as disruption of the plasma and intracellular membranes, which is mediated by MLKL phosphorylation and its membrane translocation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We identified that CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure caused mitochondrial swelling and cell membrane rupture by TEM and LDH leakage assay. Wang et al. also found that membrane translocation of MLKL was regulated by RIPK3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In our study, both RIPK3 and p-MLKL were increased in CdCl<sub>2</sub>-exposed hepatocytes. CdCl<sub>2</sub> also induced mitochondrial translocation of MLKL and necrosome formation harbored at mitochondria. Mitochondrial localized MLKL can bind to cardiolipin and lead to membrane disruption, which is the key to necroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

In this study, we discovered that inhibition of Drp1 was able to block mitochondrial translocation of MLKL and its phosphorylation caused by CdCl<sub>2</sub>. Meanwhile, Drp1 has been proven to be a downstream molecule of RIPK1-RIPK3 complex. For instance, Wang et al. reported that RIPK1-RIPK3 induced Drp1 expression and translocation to mitochondria in macrophages triggered by RNA viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Besides, mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 was raised by acetaminophen treatment in hepatocytes, which was impaired in RIPK3 knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In the present study, we found that Drp1 directly bound to RIPK3 in mitochondrial fraction, which was further enhanced by CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure.

We further discovered that RB interference inhibited the up-regulation of p-MLKL expression, mitochondrial translocation of MLKL, and increased of necroptotic cell rate caused by CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure. Moreover, there are increasing lines of evidence that RB protein translocates to mitochondria and regulates MQC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. For example, RB knockdown also increases mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in breast cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, RB homologue (Rbf1) also increases mitochondrial fragmentation through up-regulation of Drp1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.

In the current study, we proved that Drp1 could directly bind to RB at mitochondria. We further demonstrated that CdCl<sub>2</sub> induced RB expression and its translocation to mitochondria, which was also counteracted by down-regulation of Drp1. These researches indicated that RB mitochondrial translocation directly interact with Drp1, resulting in MQC disorder and necroptosis in hepatocytes triggered by CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure.</p><p id="Par20">It is urgent to seek for an effective intervention approach to inhibit necroptosis-related diseases in clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

The mitochondrial RB directly interacts with Drp1 and participates in the formation of MLKL-associated necrosome, regulating hepatocyte’s necroptosis and liver injury caused by CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure. Moreover, interventions of Drp1-RB axis with gene knockdown or pharmaceutical inhibitors alleviate CdCl<sub>2</sub>-induced necroptosis and hepatotoxicity. Our work indicated that the mitochondrial Drp1-RB axis was a potential intervention target and one of candidate markers of liver injury and associated diseases related to xenobiotics exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p id="Par22">The human immortalized hepatic L02 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life, New York, NY, USA) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Life) in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere at 37 °C.
