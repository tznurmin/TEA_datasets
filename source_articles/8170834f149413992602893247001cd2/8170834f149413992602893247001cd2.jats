id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Beer production is a significant contributor to the economy in many countries world-wide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, in the past decade there has been an impressive upturn in micro-breweries and this development has resulted in an increase in brewery waste streams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Typical liquid waste streams generated during the brewing process are run-off from spent grain from malt mashing and boiling, hot trub from hot wort tank boiling and fermentation slurry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Breweries generally mix all liquid waste streams, including water from tank washing, and discharge them as combined brewery wastewater, generating 3–20 units of wastewater per unit of beer produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Levels of the most important water quality parameters in combined brewery wastewater are reported to be 2000–6000 mg chemical oxygen demand (COD) L<sup>−1</sup>, 25–80 mg total Kjeldahl nitrogen L<sup>−1</sup> and 10–50 mg phosphates L<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The waste streams hot trub and fermentation slurry represent around 3% of the total wastewater volume, but 97% of the load of organic carbon (C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, the high nutrient levels in the combined wastewater are due to extremely high nutrient concentrations in certain waste streams produced during the brewing process.</p><p id="Par4">Brewery wastewater is generally discharged to municipal wastewater treatment plants or directly into water bodies such as rivers, lakes or the ocean in areas with poor environmental legislation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Waste management in the beer brewing industry is usually a substantial cost factor, especially for micro-breweries, due to sewer discharge fees imposed on effluent volumes and, more often, on organic loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Breweries discharging to municipal wastewater treatment plants are frequently required to carry out pre-treatment to meet legislation and reduce the load on the treatment plant. Breweries that have their own wastewater treatment, which usually comprises sedimentation and energy-intensive aerobic treatment, are faced with several problems, such as failure to meet water quality standards set by local authorities and/or large amounts of low-value sludge, which is costly to dispose of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Since waste streams from brewing processes have high biodegradability, biological treatment is frequently used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, production of by-products from brewery waste streams is possible, since the streams contain high-quality nutrients without problematic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and enteric pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One option for microbial biomass production is submerged cultivation of filamentous fungi. However, this technique has received less attention in the past three decades for treatment of waste streams, possibly due to established use of bacteria-based treatment as the standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, fungi-based treatment of brewery waste streams could offer advantages over bacteria-based wastewater treatment techniques. One benefit is that the growing mycelium converts organics and nutrients in the waste stream into easily dewaterable fungal biomass, with uses as, e.g. a food/feed ingredient or a component in biomaterial, while simultaneously reducing the organic load in contrast to low-value sludge produced during bacterial treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In a previous study, we examined fungi-based treatment of combined synthetic brewery waste streams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, an interesting and resource-efficient approach would be to keep the waste streams from the different brewing processes separate and apply an optimised treatment to each specific waste stream. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate submerged cultivation of filamentous fungi as a treatment method for separated nutrient-rich waste streams from micro-breweries. The potential for nutrient reduction by the fungi-based treatment was evaluated against official Swedish water quality parameters established for small-scale wastewater treatment systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The potential for production of fungal biomass in two different waste streams was also evaluated and the quality of the biomass produced, including total protein and amino acid composition, was determined for one selected treatment. The fungal species used in the study were either edible or have a long record of safe use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Microorganisms</title><p id="Par7">Five fungal species were used in the study: <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic> M7215, <italic>Lentinula edodes</italic> M3782, <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic> M2140, <italic>Trichoderma harzianum</italic> CBS 226.95 and <italic>Trametes versicolor</italic> M9912.

Of the three liquid waste streams tested in this study, run-off from spent grain and hot trub both supported submerged fungal growth, while less growth was observed in fermentation slurry. The lack of fungal growth in fermentation slurry could potentially be due to residual ethanol or to the ammonium concentration, which was considerably higher than in the other waste streams (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Dried fermentation slurry has potential for biovalorisation in the food and feed industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and therefore biological treatment of fermentation slurry through submerged fungal growth was not pursued further in this study.</p><p id="Par27">Among the five fungal species tested, <italic>A. bisporus</italic> and <italic>L. edodes</italic> appeared less efficient in treatment of the liquid waste streams. This is in agreement with results obtained when synthetic combined brewery wastewater was treated in a similar experimental setup in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The fungal species <italic>P. ostreatus</italic>, <italic>T. harzianum</italic> and <italic>T. versicolor</italic> showed better growth and all three strains had high biomass production on run-off from spent grain. As <italic>P. ostreatus</italic>, commonly known as oyster mushroom, has been identified as a potential source of feed nutrients such as essential amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], this species was selected for further studies on run-off from spent grain.</p><p id="Par28">In this waste stream, the initial ratio of TN to TP was around 2:1 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In a study on C:N:P ratio in fungal biomass, variations have been reported between different phyla but on average the stoichiometry is similar to the Redfield values, with an N:P ratio of 16:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, for biological treatment the amount of phosphorus was high compared with the amount of nitrogen in run-off from spent grain. This is also reflected in the results, where the relative reductions in TN and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N were generally large throughout the study and with a considerably smaller reduction in TP. The maximum reduction in TN and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N was 91.5 ± 0.8% and 86.9 ± 2.7%, respectively, whereas the maximum reduction in TP was 30.8 ± 7.8% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] has set 50% TN reduction as the legal water quality standard to be achieved by small-scale wastewater treatment systems. Considering the TN reduction results obtained in the present study when using <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> for treatment of run-off from spent grain, the standard for TN was met by a large margin, while the requirement for a TP reduction of 70% was far from being reached.</p><p id="Par29">TP includes all organic and inorganic forms of phosphorus present in the matrix, particulate as well as dissolved. An increase in the control treatment (457 ± 92.8 mg L<sup>−1</sup> of TP at day 10) compared to initial values (367 ± 18 mg L<sup>−1</sup> of TP) was observed. The high variability and the increase in the numerical value may be due to the complex matrix. Potentially the presence of particulate phosphorus, which was not dissolved in the hydrolyzing process, was affected over time by abiotic factors.</p><p id="Par30">In Sweden, 90% of the organic carbon in wastewater must be removed in order to meet current regulations on effluent water quality from small-scale wastewater treatment systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the first experiment testing fungal treatments, <italic>P. ostreatus</italic>, <italic>T. harzianum</italic> and <italic>T. versicolor</italic> were close to complying with this requirement (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In the second experiment the reduction in COD increased over time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and reached its maximum (64.1 ± 8.3%) on day 10. Thus, a treatment period of 10 days was not enough to meet the standard for reduction of organic carbon.</p><p id="Par31">In this context, it is interesting to note that in the first experiment, treatment of run-off from spent grain using <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> resulted in biomass dry weight production of 22.68 ± 2.04 g L<sup>−1</sup> after 7 days of treatment. In the second experiment, biomass production by the same strain from spent grain was 13.2 ± 2.2 g L<sup>−1</sup> after 10 days of growth. The lower biomass obtained in the second experiment can most probably be explained by the larger volume of sample in the second experiment, with accompanying difficulties in oxygenation of the medium used for cultivation. In parallel, the first experiment showed a correlation between COD reduction and biomass production for the fungal strains. Thus, optimisation of the cultivation system may lead to increased biomass production, accompanied by a larger COD reduction.</p><p id="Par32">In future development towards a bio-based society, production of microbial proteins based on low-value side-streams can be a powerful asset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The mycelium of <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> produced in the present study had a total protein concentration of 11.6 ± 2.1% of dry weight. This is similar to the average concentration of 13.2% reported by Kalac et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] on reviewing the chemical composition and nutritional value of fruiting bodies of several mushroom species. The amount of individual amino acids in the mycelium produced in run-off from spent grain was generally slightly lower than the mean value reported for fruiting bodies of <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Moreover, compared with the amino acid composition in fish meal, a commonly used component to enhance the nutritional properties of feed, the concentration of essential amino acids was low in the harvested mycelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, despite these results, pure mycelium of <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> is an interesting by-product and recent research has demonstrated the potential for production and enrichment of vitamin D in the mycelium with UV-irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">For hot trub, treatment with <italic>T. harzianum</italic> resulted in high production of biomass and the largest reduction in COD of all treatments (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This species, a soil fungus with a long tradition of applications within agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], was therefore selected for further studies in the second experiment. In the hot trub waste stream, the amount of phosphorus was high compared with the amount of nitrogen, with a ratio of TN to TP of around 1.4:1 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As observed for treatment of run-off from spent grain with <italic>P. ostreatus</italic>, use of <italic>T. harzianum</italic> to treat hot trub was efficient in reducing TN and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N. The 50% TN reduction criterion set by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] was met already on day 3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The reduction in TP was considerably lower and reached a maximum of 16.6 ± 7.8%.</p><p id="Par34">Similar to the experiments performed in run-off from spent grain an increase in TP was observed in the sterile control compared to the initial values. As discussed above this may be due to the complex matrix and effects over time on the particulate organic matter. In this waste stream also a decrease in TN was observed over time in the control suggesting gaseous losses of nitrogen.</p><p id="Par35">From the present study, it can be concluded that nitrogen was removed to a large extent by fungal treatment of run-off from spent grain and hot trub, while the removal of phosphorus was considerably lower. Considering the high concentrations of phosphorus in the waste streams and the future need for recycling of this nutrient, additional treatment will be required, e.g. using struvite precipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or fungal strains specialising in P uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">In hot trub treated with <italic>T. harzianum</italic>, the reduction in COD increased over time and the maximum reduction (38.2 ± 10.1%) was observed on day 10. Thus, considering the current regulation on effluent water quality from small-scale wastewater treatment systems (requiring 90% reduction in organic carbon), fungal treatment of hot trub was not satisfactory. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] reported a more positive result using the related species <italic>Trichoderma viride</italic> to treat winery wastewater, where COD reductions in the range 86–91% after 24 h at a cultivation temperature of 30 °C were achieved. The difference compared with the present study can be explained by the differing chemical composition of the waste stream, with lower COD values in the winery wastewater used by Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] as a main factor. However, temperature is also an important parameter, as faster growth and higher metabolic rate are observed with increasing temperature.</p><p id="Par37">As previously mentioned, growth of <italic>T. harzianum</italic> in hot trub did not result in production of distinct pellets, but dispersed growth of mycelia and increased viscosity of the waste stream. When the biomass was collected by centrifugation, the amount of biomass produced in the hot trub treated with <italic>T. harzianum</italic> was double that in the control treatment (40.2 ± 1.0 compared with 20.1 ± 1.7 g L<sup>−1</sup> dwt). This suggests that the amount of fungal biomass produced was approximately 20 g L<sup>−1</sup> dwt, which is in line with the value obtained in the first experiment (15.2 ± 3.1 g L<sup>−1</sup>). However, the different setups for harvesting makes this comparison very uncertain. In the study by Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], high biomass production rates (4.50–5.40 g dwt biomass L<sup>−1</sup> after 24 h of growth) were observed. However, unlike in the treatment using the edible <italic>P. ostreatus</italic>, the uses of the <italic>Trichoderma</italic> biomass produced is less clear. <italic>Trichoderma</italic> sp. has been highlighted as a potential biosorbent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and in a longer perspective fungal mycelium may be of use in the production of biomaterial, as exemplified by Haneef et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, from an applied perspective, the use of <italic>T. harzianum</italic> for treatment of hot trub was less successful considering the low reduction in COD and TP and the need for centrifugation for efficient separation of the biomass.</p><p id="Par38">Currently the most common approach by the micro-breweries is to mix the liquid waste streams and discharge them as combined brewery wastewater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, from an applied perspective it should be pointed out that waste streams are usually handled manually by the micro-breweries. Thus, the most nutrient-rich waste streams can be removed and collected separately. The remaining wastewater would then be less of a burden for the municipal wastewater treatment plant, due to reduction of the organic load, and this approach may also decrease the cost for waste disposal. Our study is performed to develop sustainable use of the separated waste streams and demonstrates that production of fungal biomass, parallel with improved water quality, is possible. However, there are techno-economic limitations of small-scale production of fungal biomass and further research is needed to develop this bio-based technology.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Åforsk Research Foundation (Grant number 15-43) and Skånes Environmental Protection Fund (Grant number M319), which are gratefully acknowledged.
