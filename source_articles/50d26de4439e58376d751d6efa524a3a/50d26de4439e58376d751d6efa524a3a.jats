Diversity increases the potential of whole populations to adapt to changes in environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, we are only at the beginning to understand the link between diversity and community structure and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

There have been two large previous studies on the transcriptional profile of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> during a chronic infection of the CF lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

We therefore sampled and sequenced <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates from different regions of an explanted CF lung and at the same time performed extensive ex vivo transcriptome analysis. Tissue sampling of the left lung lobe of an explanted CF lung was performed within 30 min after transfer of the lung away from the surgical field. Samples were taken at five sites: main bronchus (BR), upper lobe central (ULC) and peripheral (ULP), and lower lobe central (LLC) and peripheral (LLP). To recover individual <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates, tissue samples were streaked on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-selective agar plates, whereas for ex vivo transcriptional profiling all samples were homogenized in RNAprotect directly after removal (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The lung was explanted from a DeltaF508 homozygous CF patient, who underwent lung transplantation at the age of 35. The patient had been chronically infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> for more than 20 years. Light microscopy assessments of lung samples were conducted to observe histopathological changes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Hematoxylin–eosin staining of lung parenchyma showed a dilated conducting airway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), which was further characterized by scarring and chronically inflamed tissue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The airway lumen was filled with mucopurulent secretions and bacterial micro-colonies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In these bacterial colonies, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> could be identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Collection of regional <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> populations from an explanted cystic fibrosis (CF) lung.

DNA was isolated from subcultures of those 50 isolates and the genomes were sequenced by the use of Illumina technology at high sequencing depth (~110× genome coverage). We also sequenced the DNA isolated from cell pellets of pools of ~5000 agar-plate-grown isolates that have been recovered from the five individual regions with an ~490× coverage depth. The genomes were de novo assembled and the sequence information of the core genes was used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The clinical isolates clustered with the PAO1 reference strain, so that we aligned the sequencing reads to the PAO1 genome (GenBank accession number NC_002516.2) in order to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the individual isolates. We also determined the relative fraction of sequencing reads harboring SNPs in the five pools. A compartment-wise comparison of the detection of genetic diversity in the single isolate sequencing vs. the deep pool sequencing approach is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. Overall, there was a strong and significant linear association between the detection of SNPs in single genome vs. pooled genome sequencing as detected by Pearson’s correlation (<italic>r</italic> <italic>=</italic> 0.924). We found the highest correlation coefficient in the ULP region (<italic>r</italic> <italic>=</italic> 0.992) and the lowest in the BR region (<italic>r</italic> <italic>=</italic> 0.778). Thus, as has been described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the pooled sequencing approach reliably detected the polymorphisms and largely mirrored the relative frequency of SNPs in the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates as determined by single genome sequencing. Our results also demonstrate that the sequence variation of ten selected isolates showcases the genetic diversity within the pools recovered from the various sub-compartments.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Genome sequencing of single isolates and pools. <bold>a</bold> The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency in 10 single isolates per compartment was correlated to the SNP frequencies in the pools (mean of two replicates) of the respective compartment.

Phylogenetic clustering based on a multi-alignment of core genes of the remaining 47 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) indicated that the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates that were sampled from the same region were more closely related to each other than they were to isolates from distant regions. For further confirmation, we analyzed the distribution of the SNPs across the clinical isolates. Among all 47 sequenced <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates, we found SNPs at overall 770 positions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). In general, there was a higher number of SNPs in the isolates recovered from the central regions as compared to the peripheral regions. In all, 482, 578, and 498 SNPs were detected in the isolates of the BR, ULC, and LLC, respectively, whereas only 155 and 378 SNPs were found in the ULP and LLP, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). A median of 26 SNPs were detected among two isolates. However, the median number of sequence variations between two isolates of the same compartment was significantly lower (12 SNPs) than between different compartments (271 SNPs) (adjusted <italic>p</italic> value ≤0.001, Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test).

We sequenced Illumina RNA libraries and obtained ~37 million raw reads per sample (mean). After depletion of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads during library preparation, ~850,000 high-quality reads (mean) mapped to the PAO1 reference genome, indicating that ~97% of all reads represented human transcripts. Of those 850,000 high-quality reads, ~79% represent messenger RNA (mRNA) reads and ~20% rRNA reads. RNA-sequencing (RNASeq) does not only give information on the quantity of reads that map to the individual genes of the reference genome, but generation of complementary DNA (cDNA) also provides information on sequence variations within the mapped reads. In order to explore whether the ex vivo gene expression profiles reflects gene expression of the entire population within one compartment, we correlated the mutation frequencies in our ex vivo cDNA samples (RNASeq) to those that were found by the genome sequencing approach.

EdgeR-based differential gene expression analysis did not detect any differentially expressed gene between the respective compartments.

Pyoverdine biosynthesis genes, genes involved in siderophore transport and cell surface receptor signaling, were obviously expressed at higher levels in the lung periphery and in the upper lung lobes, whereas genes of the arginine deaminase pathway were involved in response to stress, as well as nitrogen and nitrate compound metabolic processes were expressed at lower levels in the lung periphery.

Because the processing of the explanted CF lung took time, there is the possibility that the transcriptional response recorded in this study does not accurately reflect the in vivo transcriptional profile. Also, we obtained data form only one single explanted lung. Nevertheless, the genetic differences between the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> populations in the various sub-compartments of the explanted lung seem to not have had a large impact on the general ex vivo transcriptional response to the CF lung environment. This is interesting, as a common environment-driven transcriptional profile could contribute to the maintenance of genetic diversity in the CF population, because the genetic variants do not produce a phenotype that can be selected for or against. However, caution must be taken when considering that many mutations that arise in the CF environment might be neutral. The common transcriptional profile of the genetically diverse sub-populations in this study might also be explained by the fact that transcriptional profiling of populations obscures diversity among the individual isolates within the population. We observed a strong positive correlation between the frequency of SNPs in genome and cDNA sequencing reads, indicating that also low abundant clones within the population contribute to the overall transcriptional profile. Nevertheless, only transcriptional profiling on the single-cell level would unambiguously demonstrate that the transcriptional response in the CF environment is indeed independent of the genetic background.</p><p id="Par21">The genetic variations that were found between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates inhabiting the various sub-compartments might be expected to have an impact on the bacterial phenotype when grown under conditions different from the CF environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

Mapping was performed using a stampy pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> using the PAO1 genome as a reference. Among the sequencing reads approximately 850,000 mapped to the PAO1 reference genome, indicating that &gt;97% of all reads represented human transcripts. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with the R package edgeR (v.3.20.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> after removal of genes with &lt;5 counts per million in any sample. Comparison between the ex vivo and in vitro condition was done using differential gene expression relative to a 1.5 fold-change threshold (TREAT; edgeR function glmTreat). For differential gene expression between the ex vivo sub-populations from the bronchus, central (ULC, LLC), and peripheral (ULP, LLP) region, as well as the bronchus, upper (ULC, ULP), and lower (LLC, LLP) region, an ANOVA-like test (edgeR function glmQLFTest) was used to increase the sensitivity to account for any compartment-dependent effects on the transcription level. Therefore, we used the samples from the different regions and treated them as replica. For functional enrichment, differential gene expression between central vs. peripheral, as well as upper vs. lower region was calculated (edgeR function glmQLFTest).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Variance in the ex vivo and in vitro transcriptional profiles</title><p id="Par27">To reduce the methodological bias, we first removed rRNAs, transfer RNAs, and the <italic>ssrA</italic> gene from the reads per gene data. Second, we accounted for a lower number of reads in the ex vivo (on average 850,000) compared to the in vitro samples (on average 6.7 billion), as a low number of reads might influence and increase the variance. Therefore, we subsampled the read numbers to a similar level using the R function rrarefy (R package vegan (v.2.5.2)). One sample with &lt;500,000 reads (ex vivo LLP) was removed and the remaining samples were subsampled to the next sample with the lowest number of reads. To increase comparability between the samples, genes with less than 5 counts per million (cpm) in any sample were removed from the dataset and reads of the remaining 3525 genes were normalized using trimmed mean of <italic>M</italic> values. The BCV is the square root of the tag-wise dispersion (variation per gene), which has been calculated using the package edgeR for ex vivo and in vitro samples separately. Data were visualized as density plot using the R package ggplot2 (v.2.2.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. MDS plots were generated using the R function plotMDS (default settings) from the package edgeR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>DNA extraction and sequencing analyses</title><p id="Par28">DNA was extracted from cell pellets using the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and fragmented with the S2/E210 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris) to achieve 400-nt-long fragments. Library preparation was performed using NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 device (2 × 150 bp pair-ended reads). Raw reads were mapped to the PAO1 reference genome as described for RNASeq mapping. After quality filtering of specific nucleotide variations, each SNP position in the 50 isolates were checked in the integrative genome viewer (IGV) (v.2.3.98). To correlate the SNPs of the single isolate with those of the deep pool sequencing, every SNP position as identified in the genomes of the single isolates was checked in IGV. For all SNP positions the ratio of mutated isolates to all isolates was calculated. This ratio was then correlated to the frequencies of mutated reads in the corresponding pools. The mean value from two pools was used for analyses. Furthermore, the mutation frequencies in the cDNA samples were correlated to the mutation frequencies of the pools and single isolates (per compartment). Therefore, the SNP positions found in the pool genomes were checked in IGV in the cDNA samples in order to calculate the SNP frequencies (cut-off: 20 cDNA reads). Correlation coefficients and corresponding <italic>p</italic> values were performed using Pearson’s correlation (R function cor.test). All <italic>p</italic> values were corrected using the false discovery rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Phylogenetic tree</title><p id="Par29">The genomic DNA read files (fastq) were de novo assembled using SPAdes (v.3.10.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> with default settings and the “careful” option.
