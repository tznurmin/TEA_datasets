In humans TRIM52 is conserved and has been under positive selection pressure, yet it has been lost in many non-primates. Competitive cell fitness assays demonstrated that <italic>TRIM52</italic> ablation reduces cellular fitness in multiple different cell types. To better understand how this cell-essential factor is controlled, we investigated how expression of this non-canonical protein is regulated. Here, we show that <italic>TRIM52</italic> mRNA is constitutively expressed from an intergenic region preceding the <italic>TRIM52</italic> gene. Yet, TRIM52 protein is rapidly turned-over by the proteasome with a 3.5-minute half-life, one of the shortest in the human proteome. Consistent with this extremely rapid degradation rate, all three TRIM52 domains were identified to contribute to its instability. Intriguingly, a repetitive acidic loop in the RING domain was identified as one of the main destabilizing regions, which was unexpected given the prevailing notion that these sequences are poor proteasome substrates. This work indicates that the effect of such repetitive acidic regions on proteasomal degradation depends on the protein context, and it identifies TRIM52 as an attractive model protein to study what these contextual properties are.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universit&amp;amp;#x00E4;t Wien (University of Vienna)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003065</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">Uni:Docs fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benke</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austrian Science Fund (Fonds zur F&amp;amp;#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">30231</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">30415</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">&amp;amp;#x2018;Signaling Mechanisms in Cellular Homeostasis&amp;amp;#x2019;

However, recent studies have indicated that unstructured protein regions with repetitive amino acid sequences are poor proteasome targets, providing insight into why disease-associated, toxic proteins like huntingtin may not be efficiently cleared and therefore accumulate in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The human genome encodes for approximately 600 proteins with a Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain, a hallmark of many ubiquitin E3 ligase enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

Yet, in primates the <italic>TRIM52</italic> gene has been maintained under positive selection pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

We hypothesised that TRIM52 is readily translated, yet rapidly turned-over. Indeed, upon treatment of RKO, HEK-293T, and HeLa cells for 3 h with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), TRIM52 protein was lost (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>; middle lanes).

A point-mutation in the RING domain disrupting putative E3 ligase activity was also unstable, indicating that TRIM52 E3 activity is likely not required for instability conferred by the RING domain.

In this study we characterized how TRIM52 itself is regulated. Our data show that while constitutively transcribed, steady-state TRIM52 protein levels are low as a result of very rapid turn-over by the proteasome.

Analysis of publicly available ChIP-seq data from many independent experiments in various different cell types indicated that this region is found to contain many different transcription factors. This could indicate that many of these identified factors contribute redundantly to the baseline <italic>TRIM52</italic> mRNA expression observed in all tested cell lines. In line with this notion of functional redundancy, cMYC, MAX and YY1 targeting by CRISPR each significantly, yet to a limited degree, decreased cellular <italic>TRIM52</italic> mRNA content. Moreover, several general chromatin modifiers and transcriptional repressors were found to interact with the <italic>TRIM52</italic> transcriptional region. This opens up the possibility that <italic>TRIM52</italic> mRNA levels are in addition controlled by transcriptional repression.</p><p id="Par32">Furthermore, we report that complex cell stress –such as caused by Golgi toxins- increases TRIM52 levels, albeit to various degrees depending on the cell line. On the one hand, we show that induction of the fast and transcriptionally well-defined UPR does not affect cellular <italic>TRIM52</italic> mRNA concentrations. In contrast, the Golgi stress response is less well-defined; its reported transcriptional targets have a higher degree of heterogeneity, and it occurs mainly at later time points after toxin exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This relatively late response thus likely represents a combination of genes involved in Golgi maintenance and structure, as well as unrelated general stress response genes which control the cellular decision making between recovery and resolution of stress on the one hand, and apoptosis on the other.</p><p id="Par33">Thus, while our data indicate some specificity to the treatments which upregulate <italic>TRIM52</italic> mRNA in U87MG cells, we cannot definitively conclude whether this results from direct effects on Golgi structure, or is instead driven by the general complex cell stress associated with these toxins. In addition, we found that some cell lines have a strong late <italic>TRIM52</italic> mRNA response (U87MG), whereas others do not (RKO). Nevertheless, the early increase in TRIM52 protein is similar in all circumstances, which raises the question whether this results from increased protein stability. However, double-treatments with Golgi toxins and CHX to address whether protein synthesis is required for the increase in TRIM52 protein levels have thus far been unsuccessful stemming from the high combined toxicity of these drugs. Likewise, experiments with the Pol II inhibitor actinomycin D to address whether the late <italic>TRIM52</italic> mRNA increase in U87MG cells depends on <italic>de novo</italic> mRNA synthesis have been hampered by the high cellular toxicity of combined treatment with two toxins.</p><p id="Par34">Finally, we show that TRIM52 protein steady-state levels are low as a result from rapid turn-over by the proteasome. Our measurements put TRIM52 protein half-life at 3–3.5 minutes. Proteome-wide half-life determination in yeast and human cells have identified only less than five proteins with comparably short half-lives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

This identifies TRIM52 as a protein with extreme properties both in terms of protein domain organisation, and protein regulation. Consistent with this fast degradation rate, all three TRIM52 domains were shown to contribute to its instability.</p><p id="Par35">The repetitive D/E-rich loop 2 in the extended RING domain was identified as a main destabilizing region, which was unexpected given the prevailing notion that these sequences are poor degradation substrates as they are inefficiently fed into the proteasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.
