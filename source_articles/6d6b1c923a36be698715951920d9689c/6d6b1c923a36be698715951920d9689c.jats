Large-area skin defects caused by burns and trauma can lead to pathogen invasion, dysregulation of body temperature, water loss from the body, and other serious consequences that endanger life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is therefore critical to repair skin defects quickly. Split-thickness skin grafting is the current gold standard treatment for significant traumatic skin loss, especially from burn injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, for burns spanning a large area, split-thickness skin grafting may be limited by the availability of donor skin. To overcome this problem, split-thickness skin grafts are typically minced into micrografts to increase the expansion ratio; however, this can compromise wound healing quality. In the case of dermal tissue defects, fibroblasts secrete immature extracellular matrix (ECM) into the wound area, leading to the formation of scars. A newly formed epidermis cannot establish close contact with dermal tissue, because a new basement membrane cannot be established; as a result of this unstable epidermal-dermal connection, the epidermis readily blisters and falls off, leading to chronic ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par111">In the 1980s, the burn center at the Shanghai Ruijin Hospital carried out a clinical study of skin autografts combined with an allograft in a procedure known as intermingled transplantation. This technique involved wrapping a sheet allograft around the wound and punching holes about 1 cm apart, with 0.25-cm<sup>2</sup> autograft pieces placed into the holes. A study of 12 patients who underwent this procedure documented the so-called sandwich phenomenon, whereby the skin autograft migrates between the dermis and epidermis of the allograft, causing it to degenerate as a result of host rejection while leaving the autograft intact. The allograft thus protects the autograft during the healing process. Since allogenic dermis is slowly degraded, it may serve as a scaffold to promote autologous dermal regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The ideal particulate skin cover is allogenic skin, but it is difficult and costly to obtain. The next best option is fresh pigskin, but immune rejection and biosafety are major problems. Dermal substitutes such as Pelnac (Gunze Corp., Osaka, Japan) have therapeutic potential for the treatment of full-thickness skin wounds and enhance the quality of wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pelnac consists of two layers: a porcine tendon-derived atelocollagen sponge layer and silicon film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; it serves as scaffolding for the ingrowth of fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which contribute to neodermis formation and thereby improve wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, at present, the application of artificial dermis requires a second skin graft operation, which increases patients’ discomfort. We speculated that since artificial dermis mimics the scaffold structure of allogenic skin, it can be used as an overlay of micrografts in the same manner as allogenic skin to repair the wound in a single operation, while also promoting dermal and epidermal regeneration and collagen organization.</p><p id="Par13">To investigate the above possibility, in the present study, we used Pelnac overlaid on minced split-thickness skin grafts to repair full-thickness skin defects in a rat model. The effectiveness of this treatment method was assessed by measuring the rate of wound healing; examining the formation of dermis and basement membrane; and evaluating the synthesis of collagen I and III, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, expression of growth factors related to wound healing, and scarring.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p id="Par14">Antibodies against collagen I (cat. no. ab34710; Abcam), III (cat. no. ab7778; Abcam), and IV (cat. no. ab6586; Abcam); Ki67 (cat. no. ab15580; Abcam); cluster of differentiation (CD) 31 (cat. no. ab182981; Abcam); transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (cat. no. ab92486; Abcam) and TGF-β3 (cat. no. ab15537; Abcam); α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (cat. no. ab32575; Abcam); vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (cat. no. ab46154; Abcam); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (cat. no. ab181602; Abcam); and secondary antibodies [goat anti-rabbit IgG H&amp;L (horseradish peroxidase) antibody (cat. no. ab97051; Abcam) and goat anti-mouse IgG H&amp;L (horseradish peroxidase) antibody (cat. no. ab6789; Abcam)] were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA).

In the Pelnac group, the cells from the graft had migrated to the wound surface through the Pelnac. During this process, the stratum corneum and transplanted dermis gradually separated from proliferating keratinocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>c), but the same was not observed in the Vaseline gauze group until day 14 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>d).

The results of this study show that using minced split-thickness skin grafts with Pelnac as an overlay accelerates wound healing through enhanced cell proliferation and neovascularization. This treatment also stimulated the formation of a complete basement membrane connecting the epidermal and dermal layers of skin and alleviated scarring via modulation of collagen deposition and TGF-β expression.</p><p id="Par33">Cell proliferation is essential for the repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. The expression of Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, was higher in the Pelnac group than in the Vaseline group, indicating that Pelnac may accelerate wound healing by providing a physical scaffold for proliferating cells. The local microenvironment of the wound also influences tissue repair. We found that the expression of VEGF—which regulates angiogenesis—was elevated in the Pelnac group, which could also promote wound healing. Pelnac also decreased and increased the expression of the scar-related growth factors TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, respectively, to minimize scar formation.</p><p id="Par34">Disruption of the basement membrane leads to skin fragility and blistering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The basement membrane and underlying dermis play critical roles in skin maturation and function by regulating keratinocyte growth and terminal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Deep burns can damage dermal tissue. Although transplantation of micrografts at a specific expansion ratio can enhance wound epithelialization, the basement membrane cannot be established. Without a connection between the new epidermal and dermal layers, the epidermis can readily blister and fall off, resulting in chronic ulcers. We found here that an intact basement membrane was present in the Pelnac group. Given that both keratinocytes and fibroblasts contribute to basement membrane formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we speculate that Pelnac indirectly promotes basement membrane reconstruction by providing a scaffold for keratinocyte and fibroblast proliferation and migration. Indeed, dermal scaffolds can induce the formation of dermis-like granulation tissue, thereby improving the quality of wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. HE and Masson’s trichrome staining of wound tissue on days 21 and 35 showed that the dermis was thicker and more ordered in the Pelnac as compared to the Vaseline gauze group. Pelnac also modulated the synthesis of collagen in the wound, thereby preventing excessive collagen deposition and hyperplasia. Full-thickness wounds close through re-epithelialization and contraction induced by α-SMA-positive myofibroblasts in granulation tissue; however, the persistence and activation of myofibroblasts during tissue regeneration lead to fibrotic scarring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We observed that Pelnac suppressed α-SMA expression in the dermis; it may thus enhance ECM remodeling and accelerate wound closure independent of wound contraction by inducing fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts.</p><p id="Par35">According to the healing process following minced split-thickness skin graft transplantation, we believe that Pelnac, as an overlay for minced split-thickness skin graft, still can complete the vascularization process and play its role as a dermal scaffold perfectly, and it does not affect the movement of minced split-thickness skin graft from the wound base to the wound surface; moreover, the minced split-thickness skin graft participates in the formation of the epidermis and dermis. However, as this was a rat model study for a duration of 35 days, there are some limitations. Further studies are needed to clarify how the interaction between minced split-thickness skin grafts and Pelnac promotes vasculogenesis and tissue regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">The results of this study demonstrate that using minced split-thickness skin grafts with Pelnac as an overlay is an effective one-step approach for the reconstruction of full-thickness skin defects in rats and can increase wound healing rate and quality. In addition to stimulating cell proliferation and angiogenesis, Pelnac modulated the synthesis and deposition of collagen and increased basement membrane and dermis formation along with the expression of growth factors related to wound healing while reducing scarring. This novel and promising treatment strategy can be applied to traumatic skin wounds caused by burns or injury.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><sec><p>Not applicable</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par37">Not applicable</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par38">The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>TL, CQ, HHL, and CB performed the animal experiment together.
