id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par17">Many microbes engage with one another through interspecific interactions (e.g., mutualistic and competitive interactions) to compose ecological communities and interrelate with their surrounding environments (e.g., their hosts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Investigating such communities is important not only in the context of basic scientific research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but also in applied biological research fields, such as in medical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and environmental sciences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Remarkable development of high-throughput sequencing techniques—e.g., 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and metagenomics as well as computational pipelines—have provided snapshots of taxonomic compositions in microbial communities across diverse ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and revealed that microbial compositions are associated with human health and ecological environments. For example, microbial composition in the human gut is interrelated with by numerous diseases—such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease—age, diet, and antibiotic use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The composition of soil microbial communities is related to climate, aridity, pH, and plant productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, previous studies have been limited to the context of species composition, and the effect of the structure of microbial communities (microbial ecological networks) on such associations is unclear due to a lack of reliable methods through which real interaction networks can be captured. Thus, co-occurrence networks, which infer ecological associations between sampled populations of microbial communities obtained from high-throughput sequencing techniques, have been attracting attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Co-occurrence network approaches are also related to weighted correlation network analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] for inferring molecular networks from high-throughput experimental data, such as gene expression data. A number of methods for inferring microbial association have been proposed.</p><p id="Par18">As a simple metric, Pearson’s correlation coefficient is considered. Additionally, Spearman’s correlation coefficient and maximal information coefficient (MIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] are useful for accurately detecting non-linear associations. However, these metrics may not be applicable to compositional data because the assumption of independent variables may not be satisfied due to the constant sum constraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Particularly, spurious correlations may be observed when directly applying these metrics to compositional data. To avoid this limitation, Sparse Correlations for Compositional data (SparCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] has been developed. SparCC is an iterative approximation approach and estimates the correlations between the underlying absolute abundances using the log-ratio transformation of compositional data under the assumptions that real-world microbial networks are large-scale and sparse. However, SparCC is not efficient due to its high computational complexity. Thus, regularized estimation of the basis covariance based on compositional data (REBACCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and correlation inference for compositional data through Lasso (CCLasso) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] have been proposed. These methods are considerably faster than SparCC by using the <italic>l</italic><sub>1</sub>-norm shrinkage method (i.e., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; Lasso). SparCC has further limitations, as it does not consider errors in compositional data and the inferred covariance matrix may be not positive definite. To avoid these limitations, CCLasso considers a loss function inspired by the lasso penalized <italic>D</italic>-trace loss.</p><p id="Par19">However, correlation-based approaches such as those mentioned above may detect indirect associations. To differentiate direct and indirect interactions in correlation inference, other methods have been developed. In this context, inverse covariance matrix-based approaches are often used because they estimate an underlying graphical model, employing the concept of conditional independence. Typically, Pearson’s and Spearman’s partial correlation coefficients are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; however, they may be not applicable to compositional data because statistical artifacts may occur due to the constant sum constraint. Thus, SParse InversE Covariance Estimation for Ecological ASsociation Inference (SPIEC-EASI) was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It infers an ecological network (inverse covariance matrix) from compositional data using the log-ratio transformation and sparse neighborhood selection.</p><p id="Par20">These inference methods have been implemented as software packages and applied in several microbial ecology studies, such as investigations of human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and soil microbiomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. While these methods only infer ecological associations, they are often used for discussing biological insights into interspecies interactions (i.e., microbial ecological networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]).</p><p id="Par21">Nevertheless, further careful examination may be required to determine the importance of co-occurrence network approaches. The validity of these inference methods is still debatable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] because they simply employ parametric statistical models, although microbial abundances are determined through population dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Berry and Widder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] used a mathematical model to determine population dynamics, generating (relative) abundance data based on population dynamics on an interaction pattern (network structure), and evaluated how correctly correlation-based methods reproduce the original interaction pattern. In particular, detecting interactions was harder for larger and/or more heterogeneous networks. However, they only compared earlier methods (e.g., Pearson’s correlation and SparCC) and not later methods (e.g., CCLasso) and the graphical model-based methods. In addition, whether further examination and comparison of performance is required remains debatable, since arbitrary thresholds were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the effects of interaction type, such as mutualism or competition, on co-occurrence network performance were poorly considered, even though pairs of species exhibit well-defined interactions in natural systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Weiss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] considered interaction types and evaluated correlation-based methods using a population dynamics model; however, they only examined small-scale (up to six species) networks due to system complexity, although compositional-data methods (e.g., SparCC) assume large-scale networks. Furthermore, graphical model-based methods were not evaluated.</p><p id="Par22">We comprehensively evaluated the validity of both correlation-based and graphical model-based methods for inferring microbial ecological networks. In particular, we focused on nine widely used methods. Following previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we generated relative abundance (compositional) data using a dynamical model with network structure and evaluated how accurately these methods recapitulate the network structure. We show that the performance of later methods was almost equal to or less than that of classical methods, contrary to previous studies. Moreover, we also demonstrate that co-occurrence network performance depends upon interaction types.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generation of relative abundance data using a dynamical model</title><p id="Par23">Following [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we used the <italic>n</italic>-species generalized Lotka–Volterra (GLV) equation to generate abundance data:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><mml:math display="block"><mml:mfrac><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">ij</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math><tex-math id="Equa_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Unlike a similar model used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the carrying capacity of each species is set to be equivalent to its growth rate for simplicity.</p><p id="Par24">To generate <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, we first produce undirected networks with <italic>n</italic> nodes and average degree 〈<italic>k</italic>〉 = 2<italic>m</italic>/<italic>n</italic>, where <italic>n</italic> indicate the number of species and <italic>m</italic> is the number of edges. This is done by generating adjacency matrices <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> using models for generating networks. Following Layeghifard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], three types of network structure were considered: random networks, small-world networks, and scale-free networks. In all cases <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = 1 if node (species) <italic>i</italic> interacts with node (species) <italic>j</italic> and <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = 0, otherwise, and <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>ji</italic></sub> to have undirected networks.</p><p id="Par25">The Erdős–Rényi model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was used to generate random networks in which the node degree follows a Poisson distribution where the mean is 〈<italic>k</italic>〉. The model networks are generated by drawing edges between <italic>m</italic> (=<italic>n</italic>〈<italic>k</italic>〉/2) node pairs that were randomly selected from the set of all possible node pairs. Specifically, we used <italic>erdos.renyi.game</italic> in the <italic>igraph</italic> package (version 1.2.2) of R (version 3.5.1; <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org" ext-link-type="url">www.r-project.org</ext-link>), with the argument <italic>type = “gnm”</italic>.</p><p id="Par26">However, real-world networks, including microbial ecological networks, are not random; instead, they are clustered (compartmentalized) and heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The Watts–Strogatz model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] was used to generate small-world networks whose clustering coefficients are higher than expected and random.

It should be noted that the lower triangular parts were vectorized after excluding the diagonal terms. The precision and recall were calculated by binarizing the confidence scores at a threshold. The PR curve was obtained as the relationship between precision and recall for different threshold. We used the absolute correlation coefficients for the Pearson’s correlation, Spearman’s correlation, MIC, Pearson’s partial correlation, Spearman’s partial correlation, SparCC, and CCLasso for the confidence scores. Following previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], edge-wise stability scores were used for REBACCA and SPIEC-EASI. Furthermore, we summarized the PR curve with the area under the PR curve (AUPR).

The PR curves and AUPR values were obtained using the <italic>pr.curve</italic> function in the R package <italic>PRROC</italic> (version 1.3.1).

Note that almost half of the interactions are spontaneously set to predator–prey interactions in random communities (see “Generation of relative abundance data using a dynamical model” section). To test this hypothesis, we considered interaction matrices consisting of a mixture of competitive and predator–prey interactions because co-occurrence network performance was best and worst in competitive and predator–prey (parasitic) communities, respectively.

We compared wide-ranging methods using realistic simulations. Our results provide additional and complementary insights into co-occurrence network approaches in microbiome studies.</p><p id="Par54">The results indicate that compositional-data methods, such as SparCC and SPIEC-EASI, are less useful in inferring microbial ecological networks than previously thought. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the performance (AUPR values) of the compositional-data methods was moderate; furthermore, these compositional-data methods were not more efficient than the classical methods, such as Pearson’s correlation-based method. This result is inconsistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This discrepancy was mainly due to differences in co-occurrence network method validation between this and previous studies. Specifically, previous studies generated abundance data from a multivariable distribution with a given mean and covariance matrix and examined how accurately co-occurrence network methods describe the original covariance matrix structure. However, this study considered species abundances determined through population dynamics (GLV equations) and examined how accurately the methods reproduced interaction patterns in ecological communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Population dynamics may lead to more complex associations between species abundances than parametric statistical models due to the nonlinearity of GLV equations. In compositional data co-occurrence network methods, such complex associations were likely difficult to detect because they assumed linear relationships between species abundances. The performance of Spearman’s correlation-based and MIC-based methods was almost equal to or higher than those of compositional-data methods because they can consider nonlinear associations, although such classical methods did not consider the effects of the constant sum constraint in compositional data. However, Pearson’s correlation-based method also exhibited a similar or higher performance than that of the compositional-data methods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), although it assumes linear relationships between species abundances in addition to the constant sum constraint. This may be due to approximation in the compositional-data methods, which estimate covariance matrices of the underlying absolute abundances from relative abundances using iterative approximation approaches. Thus, compositional-data methods may fail to correctly estimate the covariance structure of absolute abundance. According to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], such a limitation is present in SparCC. REBACCA is similarly limited because its formalism is comparable to SparCC, although sparse methods are different between SparCC and REBACCA; thus, the performance of SparCC and REBACCA may have been low for similar reasons. On the other hand, CCLasso avoids these limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], performing better than SparCC and REBACCA. However, more improvements may be required for CCLasso. It performed similarly to Pearson’s correlation-based method, which exhibited a higher performance using absolute abundances (particularly in sparse networks; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S3). This indicates that CCLasso did not sufficiently infer the covariance structure of absolute abundances.</p><p id="Par56">The graphical model-based methods were not more efficient than the correlation-based methods, although they do not consistently detect indirect associations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In particular, Pearson’s and Spearman’s partial correlation-based (classical graphical model-based) methods were not more useful for inferring interaction patterns in ecological communities than Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation-based (classical correlation-based) methods, and Spearman’s partial correlation-based method predicted interaction patterns in ecological communities poorly. This may have occurred due to the effects of the constant sum constraint in compositional data; specifically, these classical graphical model-based methods exhibited high performance with absolute abundances (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S3). The effects of the constant sum constraint in partial correlation-based may be more significant than those in correlation-based methods, and errors due to the constant sum constraint in pairwise correlations (zero th-order partial correlations) may be amplified when calculating higher-order partial correlations. Thus, classical graphical-based models may be less useful than classical correlation-based models. The graphical model-based method for compositional data SPIEC-EASI has a similar problem. Similar to other correlation-based methods for compositional data (e.g., SparCC), SPIEC-EASI estimates absolute abundances from relative abundances. The estimated absolute abundances are not entirely accurate, which may be amplified in partial correlation (or regression) coefficients because SPIEC-EASI calculates coefficients based on the estimated values with the errors as classical partial correlation-based methods. CCLasso considers such errors through a loss function. Thus, CCLasso exhibited performance similar to SPIEC-EASI, although it did not directly consider avoiding indirect associations.</p><p id="Par57">Interaction patterns in dense networks were difficult to predict (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This is generally because more indirect associations are observed; however, this may be because the assumption of sparsity in addition to errors due to absolute abundance approximation from relative abundances for compositional-data methods. This assumption is based on observations that real-world networks are very large and sparse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and sparsity is achieved through Lasso in the compositional-data methods. However, these Lasso-based methods might have overlooked important associations due to shrinkage and selection; Lasso may pick only one or a few strongly correlated variable pairs and shrink the rest to 0, i.e., no association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. To avoid this limitation, for example, we may need to consider the elastic-net and relaxed Lasso to estimate ecological associations under the sparsity assumption.</p><p id="Par58">Additionally, interaction patterns in heterogeneous networks were the most difficult to detect while those in small-world networks, which are homogenous, were the easiest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This result indicates that heterogeneity in degree distribution diminishes the performance of co-occurrence networks. This is consistent with the results of a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] in which it was observed that networks suffer from local hot spots of spurious correlation (indirect association) in the neighborhood of hub species that engage in many interactions. We expected that the graphical-based co-occurrence network method SPIEC-EASI avoided this limitation; however, the performance of SPIEC-EASI was similar to that of the other methods, as mentioned above. This may be due to the nonlinearity of species abundances and errors resulting from absolute abundance approximation from relative abundances. SPIEC-EASI may need to be improved.</p><p id="Par59">Co-occurrence network performance increased with more samples (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S6). More than 200 samples were required until plateaued performance was obtained. However, experimental studies may be able to consider fewer samples, down to 30 samples or less. Co-occurrence network methods that exhibit high performance with small samples must be developed.</p><p id="Par60">More importantly, we found that interaction types affect co-occurrence network performance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] also investigated the effects of interaction types. However, it used time-series data generated from GLV equations and is limited to small-scale networks to avoid system complexity. The behavior of the Lotka–Volterra systems is less understood for systems larger than two species, and small variations in the interaction matrix lead to significantly different abundance patterns. To investigate large-scale networks, we used steady-state species abundances generated from GLV equations, inspired by a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The data generation method performed by Berry and Widder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and in this study differs from the other previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] although both studies considered GLV equations. Generated datasets are considered as a collection of steady-state snapshots (i.e., cross-sectional data) rather than time-series (longitudinal) data. Moreover, it is reasonable that observed species abundances are considered as cross-sectional data rather than longitudinal data in many microbiome studies. Despite the importance of time-series microbiome analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], time resolutions are still low due to technical limitations. As a result, we found that predator–prey (parasitic) interactions decrease co-occurrence network performance (AUPR values; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This result indicates detecting predator–prey interactions is more difficult than detecting other types of interactions, such as competitive and mutualistic interactions. This may be due to the behavioral complexity of predator–prey systems. The dynamics of predator–prey systems are known to be more complex than those of the other types of systems, even if the systems consist of only two species; in particular, predator–prey systems tend to oscillate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Complex nonlinear associations are observed between the resulting species abundances obtained from predator–prey communities; thus, co-occurrence network methods failed to predict interaction patterns in these communities. This limitation may be important because predator–prey (parasitic) interactions play important roles in microbe–microbe interactions and human–microbiome interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. To avoid this issue, a compositional-data version of co-occurrence network methods based on maximal information-based nonparametric exploration, such as MIC, must be developed as MIC can detect such complex nonlinear associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">However, further careful examination may be required. For example, more realistic dynamical models must be considered. For simplicity, we used classical GLV equations, and the conclusions we reached are limited to the species abundances generated from this classical model. The GLV equations may not reflect real-world microbial ecosystems. Ideally, we should have compared the generated data with real-world data; however, such comparisons were impossible because of a lack of compiled real-world data. The data on species (relative) abundances are available in several databases (e.g., Human Microbiome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and Earth Microbiome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]); however, the model parameters (growth rate <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and interaction matrix <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>) can be adjusted to nearly fit real-world abundance data using optimization methods. Thus, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> in real-world microbial ecosystems are needed to evaluate the validity of the generated abundance data; these real-world data are poorly investigated. However, this limitation does pose a significant problem because the main result is the difficulty in inferring microbial ecological networks using co-occurrence network methods. Real-world ecosystems are likely more complex. For example, species abundances, growth rates, and interaction matrices are temporally changed due to environmental perturbations. In this case, inferring ecological associations and interactions may be more difficult. Thus, it is believed that the main result also holds in more realistic ecosystems.</p><p id="Par62">To more accurately detect ecological associations and directly detect species–species interactions, however, alternative methods are also needed. For example, a method grounded in maximum entropy models of statistical physics has been proposed to differentiate direct and indirect associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The difficulty of interpreting species–species interactions from co-occurrence data has been pointed out in community ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. To overcome this difficulty, Markov networks (Markov random fields) have been used for inferring species–species interactions from co-occurrence data in community ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Dynamics (time series)-based methods are also useful. For example, convergent cross mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] may be useful. This method is based on nonlinear state-space reconstruction and can distinguish causality in complex systems from correlation. The sparse S-map method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] is a data-oriented equation-free modeling approach for multispecies ecological dynamics whose interaction topology is unknown, and it generates a sparse interaction network from a multivariate ecological time series without presuming any mathematical formulation for the underlying microbial processes. Another method, proposed by Xiao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], is based on Jacobian (community) matrices and can infer network topology and inter-taxa interaction types without assuming any particular population dynamics model from steady-state abundance data. Randomly distributed embedding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] is a model-free framework that achieves accurate future-state prediction based on short-term high-dimensional data. However, these methods are not applicable to compositional data and must be improved. Thus, we did not consider these methods in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par63">Our findings indicate that co-occurrence network methods are not efficient in interpreting interspecies interactions in microbiome studies because these methods only infer ecological associations.
