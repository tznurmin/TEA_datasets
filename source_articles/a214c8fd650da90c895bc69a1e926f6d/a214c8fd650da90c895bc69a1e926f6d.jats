There is a rapid and very alarming development of drug resistance of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Membrane proteins make up targets for the majority of drugs on the market<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and high resolution structures are increasingly important for drug design.

One such potential target is the mycobacterial phosphatidylinositol phosphate synthase (<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PgsA1). PgsA1 catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylinositol phosphate, a precursor of phosphatidylinositol. In turn, phosphatidylinositol is the first building block in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol mannosides and their acylated derivatives, lipomannan, and lipoarabinomannan—structurally complex constituents of the mycobacterial cell wall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PgsA1 was identified as a promising candidate for drug development, due to its essential role in growth and proliferation of the pathogen and differences between the Eukaryotic and mycobacterial PI biosynthesis pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Formation of phosphatidylinositol in mycobacteria is a two-step process.

Additionally, residues 149–151 (-FIE-), located on a loop connecting transmembrane helices 4 and 5, and eight C-terminal residues could not be traced in the electron density. The electron density map does not contain any unexplained positive density in the vicinity of the protein active site that could correspond to the substrates or metal ions of PgsA1, therefore this structure is assigned to be in the apo state. Positive electron density is found at the interface between the two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit, close to the R83 in chain A and the R115 of chain B possibly corresponding to a low occupancy deoxycytidine triphosphate molecule from the crystallization condition.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Architecture of apo and Mn-substituted <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PgsA1. <bold>a</bold> Transmembrane helices are numbered (1–6) and colored in rainbow, blue—N terminus, red—C terminus. <bold>b</bold>–<bold>e</bold> Metal binding sites in the PgsA1 dimer probed by Mn-substitution and anomalous scattering difference maps.

Mn<sup>2+</sup> has very similar electronegativity and ionic radius as Mg<sup>2+</sup> but allows anomalous dispersion measurements to unambiguously determine the metal binding positions.

As expected, our metal-substituted structure reveals a di-nuclear metal binding site coordinated by D68, D71, D89, and D93 of the conserved sequence motif, as indicated by two clear peaks within a metal coordinating distance to the chelating carboxylate side chains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). In chain B of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PgsA1 homodimer, however, the anomalous difference density, corresponding to the aspartate-chelated Mn-ions, is extended indicating two alternate binding positions for the metal ion in site 2 (indicated as 2a and 2b in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>). Besides the anticipated protein-bound metal ions, additional anomalous difference density peaks were found: two in chain A and one in chain B. These additional Mn-ions appeared to be coordinated by serendipitously bound citrate molecules, most likely derived from the crystallization condition. Two citrate molecules are chelating two Mn-ions in chain A and one citrate molecule is found chelating one Mn ion in chain B (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b–e</xref>). The citrate-Mn complex is most likely not biologically relevant and result from the presence of 100 mM citrate and 120 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> in the crystallization solution. The different binding in the two protomers in the asymmetric unit is likely due to differences in accessibility and/or structural asymmetry due to crystal packing. Most likely, the same effects induce the observed differences in coordination for the catalytic dinuclear metal site observed between protomers.</p><p id="Par12">The presence of the metal ions and bound Mn-citrate ligand complexes in both protein chains appear to have a stabilizing effect on the N-terminal helix and C-terminal loop which now can be indubitably traced in the electron density (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). One of the citrate molecules binds to approximately the same area of the positively charged pocket in both protein chains.

Mg-1, coordinated by the N-terminal aspartates of the signature motif, establishes the binding site by also coordinating the substrate phosphates. There are however interesting differences between the protein chains, illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The metal site in chain A replicates the coordination and metal binding sites 1 and 2a observed in the Mn<sup>2+</sup> substituted protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). The two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are 4.6 Å apart; we denote this coordination mode as the “tight” state. In chain B, on the other hand, the metal site adopts the other state observed in the Mn<sup>2+</sup> substituted protein, with the metal ions occupying positions 1 and 2b. In this “relaxed” state, the metal-metal distance is 5.4 Å. This difference is primarily achieved because of a carboxylate shift of the Mg-2 coordinating D89 and the presumed catalytic base D93 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>). Together, this suggests that the metal in site 2 has two possible binding positions and that the coordination mode is influenced by the surrounding environment. Both Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions in chain A are 6-coordinate, Mg-1 is coordinated by D68, D71, D89, and the CDP-DAG phosphate groups. Mg-2 is coordinated by D89, which adopts two conformations as supported by the electron density—in chain A, bridging both metal ions and in chain B coordinating only Mg-2. Water molecules complete the metal primary coordination spheres (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">There are two pronounced anionic membrane phospholipid binding sites in the deep hydrophobic cleft between two protein chains on both sides of the protein dimer. These hydrophobic clefts extend in the direction of the extracellular side of the protein towards the positively charged residue patch. This patch is formed by R115 from one protomer together with W106 and H111 from the other. These phospholipid-binding sites are especially well defined in the CDP-DAG bound structure. The side chains of R115, W106, and H111 are within hydrogen bonding distance to a bound SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> ion. This sulfate ion, presumably originating from the crystallization solution, potentially indicates the binding position for the negatively charged head group of a phospholipid. Based on the shape of the corresponding electron density and surroundings, the unidentified lipids are modeled as monoolein fragments (2,3-dihydroxypropyl fatty acids) with varying chain length (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), as monoolein was used for the formation of the lipidic mesophase for LCP crystallization. Two additional sulfate ions in close vicinity to the site could also be modeled in this structure, yet at somewhat lower occupancies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>D-<italic>myo</italic>-inositol-3-phosphate binding site probed by molecular docking</title><p id="Par16">A hydrophilic pocket, exposed to the cytoplasm, is formed by both protein chains and is lined by flexible positively charged residues—R94, R152, R155, R195, and K135, as well as R137 of the second protein chain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). This has previously been speculated to be the position for binding of the alcohol substrate in CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In all crystal structures, except for the Mn-citrate bound, at least one sulfate ion (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (1)) is bound in the apical side of the pocket, hydrogen bonded to S132, R155, R195 and the main chain of R152. In the Mn-citrate complex structure one of the citrate carboxylates assumes the position of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (1) in both protein chains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). It appears plausible that this conserved positively charged binding site is involved in coordinating the phosphate moiety of the ino-P substrate. In addition, there is a second bound sulfate ion (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (2)), seen only in the CDP-DAG bound structure and located about 5 Å away from the catalytic aspartate D93 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). It is coordinated by K135 and R137 of the second protein chain located on the cytosolic side of the protein, close to the calculated position of the membrane plane (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In the Mn-citrate complex structures this binding position is also occupied by a citrate carboxylate in chain A, while in chain B the corresponding carboxylate of the citrate is slightly shifted (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Conserved positively charged sulfate and citrate binding pocket in proximity to the metal site indicates the binding site for D-<italic>myo</italic>-inositol-3-phosphate. <bold>a</bold> Localization and coordination environment of two sulfate ions in the CDP-DAG bound <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PgsA1 at the active site.

However, the serendipitously obtained di-manganese citrate complex, as well as the bound sulfate molecules, suggests that this solvent-accessible pocket proximal to the CDP-DAG binding site is a plausible binding site for the second substrate.</p><p id="Par18">We proceeded with molecular docking to probe if this binding site would support a plausible binding mode for ino-P. Docking of ino-P was performed against all three structural models: apo, CDP-DAG and Mn-citrate bound with the ligands removed. Two separate clusters of plausible binding modes were obtained in the docking experiments. In both cases, the phosphate of the Ino-P substrate overlaid well with the sulfate ions observed in the CDP-DAG structure. Both selected binding modes resulted in a positioning of the inositol headgroup that placed the 1′ hydroxyl within hydrogen bonding distance of the Mg-2 coordinating fourth aspartate (D93) in the signature motif, consistent with bond formation to the correct hydroxyl of the substrate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). Binding mode #1 (yellow) placed the phosphate at the position of sulfate binding site 1 which appears conserved in all previously determined structures of CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases while binding mode #2 (magenta) placed the phosphate at the position of the second sulfate binding site, observed in CDP-DAG bound <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PgsA1. The best binding energy was observed for binding mode #1 which was also the top solution in docking against both the CDP-DAG and the Mn-citrate complex structures. Both of the plausible binding modes were also observed when docking against the apo structure, albeit with worse binding energies and not representing the top solution. In all cases, binding mode #1 was predicted to be better than binding mode #2. The docking results are consistent with the experimental results that CDP-DAG promotes binding of ino-P (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>) and shows that this effect is at least partly mediated via protein conformational changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Mutagenesis supports the inositol phosphate binding mode suggested by molecular docking</title><p id="Par19">In order to validate the results obtained by molecular docking, several previously uncharacterized mutations, A90Y, R94K/Q, Y133F/E, and R137K/Q, were introduced and protein specific activity was measured using a malachite green based discontinuous assay in proteoliposomes. None of these four residues are part of the signature motif, however, the residue in sequence position 94 is always positively charged (K or R) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Based on our crystal structures and molecular docking results, we expected these mutations to affect protein activity negatively due to compromised binding of the ino-P caused by altered local positive surface charge or steric interference with the binding of the substrate.

As anticipated, when A90 is exchanged for a bulkier side chain, tyrosine, activity is significantly reduced, presumably due to steric hindrance and substrate positioning of the inositol ring relative to D93 and the metal site. This mutation would be expected to influence both potential binding modes in a similar way. However, the mutational studies also show that R94 is a key residue for activity. Its conservative substitution for lysine diminishes protein activity dramatically, and substitution with glutamine nearly abolishes activity. R94 thus appears to be critical for ino-P binding. R94 contributes to the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (1) binding site, directly interacting with the Ino-P phosphate in binding mode #1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). On the other hand, R137, located on the second protomer, contributes to the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (2) binding site and interacts with the Ino-P phosphate in binding mode #2 (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Interestingly, the R137K mutation does not have a similar effect on activity as the R94K, in this case protein activity is comparable to wild-type. A R137Q mutation, however, reduces activity by approximately half. Y133 from the second protomer also lines the substrate-binding pocket. The Y133F mutant is almost equally active as the wild-type, thus removal of the hydroxyl group does not prevent productive substrate binding. Substitution of this tyrosine to glutamate, however, completely abolishes the activity, presumably due to disrupting the charge distribution in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> binding position (1). Previous studies show that affinity for ino-P in the P153V mutant is reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. P153 stacks against SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (1) in the crystal structures and if substituted to valine, would interfere with the binding of the phosphate group of the ino-P in binding mode #1. Together, the docking and mutational data suggest that binding mode #1 with the phosphate group of the inositol occupying the position of the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (1) is the most plausible and represents a good model for binding of ino-P in PgsA1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par21"><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PgsA1 has been identified as a promising candidate for drug development because of its vital role in growth and proliferation of the pathogen as well as the differences between eukaryotic and mycobacterial PI biosynthesis pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In recent years a number of crystal structures of class I CDP-APs were released, shedding light on overall architecture and functional aspects of conserved residues in these enzymes.

However, the limited resolution of substrate-bound structures (3.6 Å for the CDP-DAG bound structure of RsPIPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, as well as the lack of structural information of the catalytic di-nuclear metal site, has significantly hampered detailed mechanistic proposals, central for scientific understanding and drug design.</p><p id="Par22">In line with previous studies, co-crystallization with D-<italic>myo</italic>-inositol-3-phosphate was not successful. However, the Mn-citrate complex revealed a plausible binding pocket for this substrate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). This presumption is strengthened by the presence of a conserved sulfate binding site (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (1), Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Moreover, biochemical data suggest that CDP-DAG primes the active site for the binding of ino-P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, the docking results are also consistent with this observation. Previous mutational studies as well as the ones reported here support the proposed binding mode #1 for ino-P. First, functional characterization of the strictly conserved R155 and R195 coordinating the structurally conserved SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (1)), by Clarke et al. in addition to the observed inhibitory effect of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> on enzymatic activity, suggest a critical importance of these two side chains in specific binding of the phosphate group of the ino-P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The docking experiments suggest that R155 and R195 are involved in coordinating and correctly orienting the ino-P with its 1’ hydroxyl relative to the catalytic site (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). In addition, sequence alignment of CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferases show that R94 is conserved in CDP-AP enzymes utilizing ino-P as a substrate. R94 is located close to the estimated position of the ino-P phosphate group (for the binding mode #1). Our mutagenesis experiments show that R94 is crucial for protein activity. The R94 residue is much more sensitive to mutational changes than R137, interacting with the ino-P phosphate in binding mode #2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The K135 side chain, which is coordinating the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (2) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), is also less sensitive to mutations, indicating that ino-P binding mode #2 is less likely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Additional mutations designed to alter the charge of the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> -housing pocket or to ensure steric obstruction for binding of the ino-P in this site, led to compromised or abolished enzymatic activity, in agreement with the suggested ino-P binding mode.</p><p id="Par23">The CDP-DAG bound <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> PgsA1 structure reveal an outward movement and rotation of TM2 along its axis and subsequent slide of αA along the TM2, as compared to the apo structure (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).

Since this 3<sub>10</sub> motif is present in all to date published structures of CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases, it seems to have a functional role. Most likely, outward movement of TM2 allows accommodation of bulky lipid substrates such as CDP-DAG in this class of enzymes. M69 appears to play a crucial role in in this process: Clarke el al. showed that M69A exhibits a significant increase in enzymatic activity, while nearly no activity was observed in the M69W variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These results are well in agreement with the structural data, as M69 appears to regulate the access of the large hydrophobic substrate to the active site.
