Since the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from tongue tumors also showed high levels of the immune checkpoint inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, we tested combination immunotherapy targeting both CTLA-4 and PD-1 together and observed 93.3% survival of mice bearing tumors in the tongue for the duration of our 100-day study. Protective immunity correlated with a significant decrease in immunosuppressive lymphoid and myeloid populations within the tumor microenvironment. Consistent with the reported capacity of interferon-driven PD-L1/PD-1 pathway induction to serve as a biomarker of response to PD-1 blockade, we observed elevated interferon signaling and significantly higher levels of PD-1/PD-L1 in tongue-implanted mEER tumors compared to those growing on the flank correlating with their preferential responsiveness to PD-1 blockade. More importantly, in a pseudometastasic mouse model bearing both flank and tongue tumors to represent metastatic disease, delivery of Stimulator of Interferon Induced Genes (STING) agonist into the flank tumors combined with systemic treatment with α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 antibodies resulted in sustained tumor regression in 71% of mice. In this case, productive abscopal anti-tumor immunity was associated with robust increases in the ratios of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CTL) versus regulatory T cells (Treg) and versus functional myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC).</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These results support combining α-PD-1 therapy with induction of IFN-α/β signaling via provision of STING agonist and/or through CTLA-4 blockade as potential treatment option for HNSCC patients, especially, those not responding to α-PD-1 monotherapy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Abscopal</kwd><kwd>Checkpoint blockade</kwd><kwd>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells</kwd><kwd>HNSCC</kwd><kwd>HPV</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>MDSC</kwd><kwd>STING</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">RP180472</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40425_2019_Article_728.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine &amp; Public Health</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Oncology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Immunology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="AuthorContribution"><p>Stephanie Dorta-Estremera and Venkatesh L.

The HPV<sup>+</sup> HNSCC patients are younger with tumors typically in the tonsillar region or base of tongue, lymph node involvement and with higher risk of advanced metastatic disease when compared to HPV<sup>−</sup> patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The HPV<sup>+</sup> tumors are also pathologically distinct with increased lymphocyte infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. While immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) is effective in HPV<sup>+</sup> patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the response rate is still low (&lt; 15%) and achieving the curative efficacy in majority of the patients remains an unmet medical need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, strategies targeting multiple immune checkpoints alone or in combination with therapeutic vaccines and/or targeted therapies are of critical interest in this area.</p><p id="Par30">Upon activation, tumor-infiltrating T cells express immune checkpoint receptors such as programmed death-1 (PD-1) to maintain self-tolerance. In the tumor microenvironment, high expression of PD-1 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells indicates engagement of an “off switch” suggesting deficient effector function and poor expansion and memory potential. Furthermore, sustained PD-1 expression is often associated with expression of multiple inhibitory receptors leaving T cells dysfunctional within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this setting, blockade of PD-1 has evolved into the treatment of choice to preserve and restore the function of anti-tumor T cells. For multiple cancers, α-PD-1 immunotherapy has proven successful in enhancing effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In case of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), expression of PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, within the tumor has been correlated with poor prognosis, suggesting that α-PD-1 therapy is a relevant approach to anti-tumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, because of the low response rate to anti-PD1 therapy in HNSCC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], it is important to better understand the tumor microenvironment of HNSCC in order to elucidate precise mechanisms of resistance to α-PD-1 therapy, and to design supplemental treatments or combination strategies to reverse α-PD-1 non-responsiveness and improve clinical outcome.</p><p id="Par31">Previously, we reported that immunotherapy using α-4-1BB, α-CD40, or α-CTLA-4 showed modest single-agent efficacy against HPV-16 E6/E7<sup>+</sup> tonsillar-epithelia derived mEER tumors implanted subcutaneously on the flank of syngeneic C57BL/6 J mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While various combinations of α-4-1BB, α-CD40 or α-CTLA-4 antibodies were significantly more efficacious compared to single-antibody treatments, therapeutic efficacy was enhanced when immunotherapy treatments were combined with intranasal E6/E7 peptide vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, PD-1 blockade, demonstrated little to no efficacy against subcutaneous mEER tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In contrast to flank-implanted mEER tumors, we observed that α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 demonstrated the greatest single-agent efficacy in treating these HPV<sup>+</sup> oropharyngeal tumors implanted in the tongue. Since the oral cavity contains a distinct immune infiltrate relative to other systemic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we sought first to identify the cell populations responsible for differential α-PD-1 therapy responsiveness, and second to investigate effective strategies to improve responses to α-PD-1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par32">Male C57BL/6 mice (5–10 weeks) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories and were maintained in a pathogen-free environment.

We therefore, tested whether combination therapy to block either of these inhibitory receptors would enhance the efficacy of α-PD-1 therapy of tongue tumors. For this, we treated mice with tongue-implanted tumors at days 5, 8 and 11 with α-PD-1 alone or in combination with α-CTLA-4 or α-Lag3. The majority of mice treated with the combination of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 exhibited tumor free survival through day 80 of follow up, while all of the mice in the control untreated group exhibited high tumor burden (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). In contrast, survival rates for mice treated with the combination of α-PD-1 plus α-Lag3 were not significantly different from those of mice treated with α-PD-1 alone.

This is consistent with the PD-1/PD-L1 expression patterns (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) as well as the relatively superior responsiveness of tongue tumors to α-PD-1 therapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Based on this information, we reasoned that treatment with type I and/or type II IFNs would improve the α-PD-1 therapy sensitivity of mEER tumors by modulating the expression of PD-1/PDL-1. Additionally, since the cytosolic nucleic acid sensor, Stimulator of Interferon Induced Genes (STING) activates IFN secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and intratumoral administration of cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) STING agonists such as ML-RR-CDA (ADU-S100) has been shown to activate both IFN-α/β and IFN-γ signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we tested whether stimulation of the STING pathway would induce expression of PD-1/PD-L1 to promote responsiveness to α-PD-1 therapy.

Similarly, while the combination of checkpoint antibodies was able to significantly enhance CTL levels in the flank, CTL frequency in the tongue was only enhanced in combination with STING injection into the flank tumor.

Based on the high levels of CTLA-4 and Lag3 expressed on CD8 T cells in these tumors, we pursued combination immunotherapy targeting these two additional inhibitory receptors to further improve the effectiveness of α-PD-1 therapy against orthotopic HNSCC. Our results showed that combining α-PD-1 with α-CTLA-4 antibody, but not α-Lag3, resulted in significantly enhanced tumor-free survival relative to that of mice treated with either antibody alone. While the combination of α-PD-1 with α-Lag3 was highly efficacious in preclinical models of fibrosarcoma, colon cancer, and advanced recurring melanoma, the survival advantage was only modest in other cancers such as ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade therapies are functionally non-redundant and complementary with distinct underlying cellular mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Alternatively, although Lag-3 is present on these tumor T cells, its actual capacity to repress their activation and function may be limited in comparison to that of CTLA-4 and PD-1.</p><p id="Par54">Even though, immunotherapy with checkpoint antibodies produces remarkable and durable anti-tumor immune responses, they are associated with acute toxicities in some patients, including a variety of hepatic pathologies attributable to infiltration of immune cells into liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

These low rates of liver toxicity may be harder to see in mice due to lack of external immune exposure history.

Even though, IFN-α therapy is FDA approved for several hematologic and solid tumors, its success and wider application has been restricted due to a complex and non-specific activity profile and significant toxicity.

A recent report from our group evaluating intratumoral delivery of checkpoint antibodies targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and 4-1BB in combination with low-dose STING agonist in the TRAMP-C2 model of prostate cancer showed abscopal tumor regression with combination efficacy correlating with systemic antitumor immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the current study, we sought to simultaneously target the IFN pathway using a STING agonist along with additional checkpoint modulation (α-CTLA-4) to overcome resistance to α-PD-1 treatment in the flank implanted mEER tumors, while seeking to also enhance the observed efficacy in mice co-implanted with tongue tumors. Intratumoral STING activation along with a combination of α-CTLA-4 and α-PD-1, relative to no treatment or individual treatments, produced the most significant survival advantage in this pseudometastasic setting with regression of both flank and distant tongue tumors. We have shown that such unprecedented abscopal efficacy was associated with a marked increase in the ratios of CTL to Treg as well as to functional MDSC populations. Our results are consistent with a previous report in another oral cancer model where STING agonist was found to be effective against immunogenic, T cell-inflamed MOC1 tumors, and its combination with anti-PD-L1 was able to produce systemic anti-tumor immune responses and regression of bilateral flank tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

The therapeutically effective dose of α-PD-1/α-CTLA-4 and ML-RR-CDA used in our study translate to human equivalent doses comparable to those currently being used in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Combining STING agonist with α-PD-1 was almost as effective as α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 combination. This is particularly interesting, and the combination of targeting STING along with α-PD-1 could be a better alternative in humans because of relatively higher toxicities expected with α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 combination. On the flip side, although intratumoral delivery of STING has been successfully carried out in human trials with accessible solid tumors, it could be challenging depending on cancer type and location. To overcome this, non-nucleotide STING agonists have been developed recently which can be administered systemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Admittedly, as with many preclinical mouse models, the mEER tongue tumor model showing 50% efficacy of α-PD-1 therapy does not truly mirror the less than 20% human clinical responses.

Therefore, our primary focus was to understand the underlying mechanisms governing response versus resistance in each site, as a way to gain insight into tissue factors which may dictate differential responses between responder and non-responder patients, and, in turn, to study interventions (i.e. STING agonist) that can push non-responders over into responders. Our results support the use of mEER as a model to test mechanisms involved in α-PD-1 resistance and to identify immunotherapies or their combination with other targeted therapies to enhance the efficacy of α-PD-1 treatment in oropharyngeal tumors.</p><p id="Par57">In conclusion, our results suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of systemic α-PD-1 immunotherapy of HPV<sup>+</sup> oropharyngeal HNSCC, both in the case of primary and advanced metastatic disease (modeled here with mice harboring tumors in the flank and tongue) can be greatly enhanced by combining with additional T cell checkpoint-targeting antibodies such as α-CTLA-4 and/or through intratumoral delivery of STING activating agents to achieve near complete and durable tumor regression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. John Lee, for kindly providing us the HPV<sup>+</sup> mEER cell line.
