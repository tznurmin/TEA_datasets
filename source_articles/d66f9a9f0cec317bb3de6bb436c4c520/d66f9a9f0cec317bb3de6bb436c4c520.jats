Previously we found that PRMT1 activity in the liver is altered after alcohol exposure resulting in epigenetic changes. To determine the impact of these PRMT1 changes on the liver’s response to alcohol, we induced a hepatocyte specific PRMT1 knockout using AAV mediated Cre delivery in mice fed either alcohol or control Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet. We found that in alcohol fed mice, PRMT1 prevents oxidative stress and promotes hepatocyte survival. PRMT1 knockout in alcohol fed mice resulted in a dramatic increase in hepatocyte death, inflammation and fibrosis. Additionally, we found that alcohol promotes PRMT1 dephosphorylation at S297. Phosphorylation at this site is necessary for PRMT1-dependent protein arginine methylation. PRMT1 S297A, a dephosphorylation mimic of PRMT1 had reduced ability to promote gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, pro-apoptotic genes BIM and TRAIL and expression of a suppressor of hepatocyte proliferation, Hnf4α. On the other hand, several functions of PRMT1 were phosphorylation-independent, including expression of oxidative stress response genes, Sod1, Sod2 and others. <italic>In vitro</italic>, both wild type and S297A PRMT1 protected hepatocytes from oxidative stress induced apoptosis, however S297D phosphorylation mimic PRMT1 promoted cell death. Taken together these data suggest that PRMT1 is an essential factor of liver adaptation to alcohol; alcohol-induced dephosphorylation shifts PRMT1 toward a less pro-inflammatory, more pro-proliferative and pro-survival form.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/100005347</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">Pinnacle Award 2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tikhanovich</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_45585.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Alcohol is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Chronic alcohol abuse underlies the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), encompassed by a spectrum of pathologies, ranging from steatosis to more severe forms of liver injury, including alcoholic hepatitis (AH), fibrosis and cirrhosis. AH, an inflammatory condition characterized by infiltration of leukocytes and hepatocellular injury, remains an important contributor to mortality from ALD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Alcohol interacts with other causes of liver disease, including hepatitis B and C, and conditions such as diabetes and obesity to increase the risk for developing alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma, either synergistically or additively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The specific mechanisms responsible for ALD development and progression are not fully understood.</p><p id="Par3">Protein arginine methylation is a common posttranslational modification that plays a role in multiple pathways, including cell cycle control, RNA processing, innate immune responses, apoptosis, oxidative stress responses and other processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. PRMT1 is responsible for about 85% of total cellular arginine methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. PRMT1 catalyses arginine mono- and dimethylation using S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor. It methylates both histone and non-histone proteins, however many protein targets are not yet defined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

Here, we found that in alcohol fed mice PRMT1function is altered. PRMT1 does not regulate hepatocyte proliferation and instead its main function is prevention of oxidative stress and promotion of hepatocyte survival. PRMT1 knockout in alcohol fed mice results in a dramatic increase in hepatocyte death, inflammation and fibrosis and increased serum ALT levels suggesting that PRMT1 is protective against alcohol induced liver injury. Our data suggest that alcohol promotes PRMT1 dephosphorylation at S297. Phosphorylation at this site regulates PRMT1 target specificity. We found that this phosphorylation regulates PRMT1 dependent asymmetric di-methyl arginine production, PRMT1-dependent gene expression of cytokines, such as TNFα, FOXO3 target genes BIM and TRAIL, and expression of the Hnf4α gene. On the other hand, several functions of PRMT1 were phosphorylation-independent, including expression of oxidative stress response genes. We found that PRMT1 directly binds to these genes’ promoters and promotes recruitment of p300 acetyltransferase. By this mechanism, PRMT1 protects from oxidative stress induced hepatocytes apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hepatocyte-specific PRMT1 knockout mice develop more severe liver injury after alcohol feeding</title><p id="Par5">To test the role of PRMT1 in alcohol induced liver injury, we used a hepatocyte specific PRMT1knockout mouse model described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

We found that wild type animals did not get an ALT elevation with 4.8% alcohol, while ALT was elevated 3-fold over baseline with 6.4% alcohol. However, PRMT1 knockout mice had an ALT increase of 10-fold in both alcohol groups but not in pair fed animals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>).

We found that PRMT1 knockout mice have an increase in the number of cleaved caspase 3 positive cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), suggesting that PRMT1 knockout in hepatocytes results in an increase in hepatocyte apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that that PRMT1 knockout mice have higher oxidative stress in the liver. We used 4-HNE as a marker of oxidative stress and found that alcohol feeding resulted in a mild increase of 4-HNE in wild type mice.

Thus, we hypothesized that a change of PRMT1’s function could be a simple mechanism to coordinate changes, both positive and negative, in multiple pathways necessary for response to environmental challenges such as alcohol exposure.</p><p id="Par28">The striking finding of this study is that PRMT1 plays an important role as an alcohol protection factor. While knocking out PRMT1 in hepatocytes has little effect under control conditions, the knock out mice were greatly sensitized to alcohol with increased oxidative stress, elevated serum ALT, increase hepatocyte death and increased lipid accumulation. Interestingly, PRMT1 appeared to have different functions depending on whether or not the mice were on alcohol containing diets. We found that alcohol promoted de-phosphorylation of PRMT1, and this resulted in a change in PRMT1’s main function in the liver from a suppressor of hepatocyte proliferation to a promoter of survival in response to oxidative stress. These different functions of PRMT1 after alcohol exposure depended on its dephosphorylation to different degrees. While cytokine production, BIM, TRAIL and MMP7 expression were dependent on phosphorylation status, control of the oxidative stress response was phosphorylation-independent and, based on our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, likely mediated by direct promoter binding and p300 recruitment to Sod1 and Sod2 promoters.</p><p id="Par29">Very little is known about factors that regulate PRMT1 activity and substrate specificity.

Here we found that S297 is a PP2A-dependent phosphorylation site which controls PRMT1’s ability to generate protein arginine methylation. S297 is located within the THW domain of PRMT1, one of the protein substrate binding sites. The THW domain is present in all the PRMTs and has previously been reported to control the ability to make dimethyl arginine (DMA) in PRMT7 and PRMT6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

First, the dephosphorylated mimic, S297A PRMT1, was unable or less able to induce cytokine production (<italic>Tnfa, Il1b, Il6</italic>). These data agree with reports that have identified PRMT1 arginine methyltransferase activity as a factor that is required for optimal NF-κB activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In addition, phosphorylation was required for HNF4α expression regulation. In this case, the regulation is mediated via promoter histone arginine methylation and possibly by arginine methylation of HNF4α itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

This function of PRMT1 might be important in further progression of liver disease induced by alcohol.</p><p id="Par31">Finally, PRMT1 phosphorylation was necessary for FOXO3 binding and induction of FOXO3 target genes BIM and TRAIL. Previously we reported that in the presence of alcohol, FOXO3 specifically promotes expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including BIM and TRAIL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Here we found that PRMT1 phosphorylation is a finetuning mechanism of regulation of FOXO3-dependent transcription. PRMT1 phosphorylation is necessary for PRMT1-FOXO3 binding, which is required for FOXO3 stability and activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Dephosphorylated PRMT1, as a result, is unable to promote BIM and TRAIL expression.</p><p id="Par32">The loss of PRMT1 under alcohol conditions when it is dephosphorylated does not change protein methylation levels, yet it still causes changes in antioxidant and cell death responses. This suggests that PRMT1 has functions independent of its enzymatic activity and may be mediated by direct target promoter binding which we observed for <italic>Sod1</italic> and <italic>Sod2</italic> genes. This is similar to other epigenetic regulators that have both enzymatic activity dependent and independent functions. For example, JMJD3, a well-known histone lysine demethylase has demethylase independent functions as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, and the lysyl-oxidases LOXL1 and LOXL2 have enzymatic activity-independent functions in EMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">Another function of PRMT1 we found to be phosphorylation independent is ADMA generation. PRMT1 is a major source of the NOS inhibitor ADMA. We found that hepatocyte PRMT1 makes about one third of serum ADMA, and alcohol does not affect this function. That suggests that ADMA generation is not controlled by S297 phosphorylation, i.e. phosphorylation independent. These data suggest that reduced ADMA in knockout mice fed alcohol can lead to an increase of NO levels in hepatocytes and together with increased superoxide generation (due to low Sod1 and Sod2 levels), this leads to peroxynitrite formation that exacerbates the hepatocyte death and liver injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The relative contribution of this mechanism to the phenotype of PRMT1 knockout mice fed alcohol is a subject for future studies.</p><p id="Par34">Our data suggest that PRMT1-dependent oxidative stress response gene regulation is relevant in humans as well. We found that the PRMT1 level varies among healthy individuals and correlates with SOD2 expression in the liver. These data suggest that individuals with low PRMT1 and as a result low SOD2 levels can be more susceptible to alcohol induced liver injury. Further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p id="Par35">In summary we found that PRMT1 protects the liver from alcohol by both activity-dependent and activity-independent mechanisms. Previously we showed that PRMT1 is upregulated shortly after alcohol exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, here we found that there are two forms of PRMT1, the S297 phosphorylated form that predominates in the non-alcohol condition and a de-phosphorylated form that is generated after alcohol exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The phosphorylated form is more efficient in promoting the expression of cytokines, HNF4α and MMP7, BIM and TRAIL expression. Phosphorylation independent functions include Cpt1 expression, ADMA generation and the antioxidant stress response. Alcohol dephosphorylates PRMT1, thus promoting its shift to become a factor that promotes a less pro-inflammatory, more pro-proliferative and pro-survival hepatocyte phenotype in the presence of alcohol. Failure to dephosphorylate PRMT1, as seen from S297D mimic experiments, results in higher susceptibility to oxidative stress induced apoptosis. These results suggest that PRMT1 is an important factor of liver adaptation to alcohol.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Model of PRMT1 activity shift in alcohol fed mice.

However, our results indicate that in the liver PRMT1 is necessary for alcohol protection and PRMT1 induction in this case might be beneficial. Betaine supplementation has previously been demonstrated to protect the liver against alcohol. Betaine is required for the generation of methionine from homocysteine, a reaction that is central to the recycling of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the methyl group donor for PRMT1. Some studies suggest that beneficial effects of betaine and SAM supplements are in part due to PRMT1 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.
