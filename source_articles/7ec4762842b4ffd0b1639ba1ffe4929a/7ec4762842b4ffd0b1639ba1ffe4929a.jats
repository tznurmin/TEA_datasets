Studying monogenic disorders with predominant autoimmunity offers an attractive strategy to identify core regulators of immune homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Key regulatory components which help tune immune responses include regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and the checkpoint protein CTLA-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. CTLA-4 is constitutively expressed on T<sub>regs</sub> and upon activation on activated conventional helper-T cells (T<sub>conv</sub>). CTLA-4 ligand engagement results in rapid internalization from cell surfaces by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and shuttling to either lysosomes or RAB11<sup>+</sup> recycling endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Functionally, CTLA-4 competes with the activating co-receptor CD28 for interaction with their shared ligands CD80/CD86 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, thereby inhibiting T-cell costimulation. Binding of CTLA-4 to CD80/CD86 results in ligand transendocytosis into T cells, sequestering the costimulatory ligands from APCs. Inside the T cell, CD80/86 are guided to lysosomal degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Interaction of CTLA-4 with lipopolysaccharide-responsive and beige-like anchor protein (LRBA) is essential for prevention of its own degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The importance of CTLA-4 in regulating human immune tolerance is underlined by several SNPs conferring increased risk of autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and further solidified with the recent identification of patients with monoallelic mutations in <italic>CTLA4</italic> or biallelic mutations in <italic>LRBA</italic> suffering from severe autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Additional cellular regulators of CTLA-4 and their relevance to human disease remain to be investigated.</p><p id="Par4">DEF6, also known as IRF4 binding protein (IBP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> or SWAP-70-like adaptor of T cells (SLAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> is a unique guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which has an inverse conformation of the PH-DH domain compared to conventional GEFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. DEF6 acts downstream of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and can be phosphorylated by the tyrosine-protein kinases LCK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and ITK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. It can activate small GTPases of the RHOA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and Ras family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, NFAT1 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and T-cell adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, DEF6 binds and negatively regulates the transcription factor IRF4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Murine knockout studies have illustrated a role of Def6 in immunological synapse formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, Th1/Th2 lineage differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, IL17 and IL21 production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, bacterial phagocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, T-cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, as well as a possible role in early-onset large vessel vasculitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Interestingly, other studies of <italic>Def6</italic>-knockout mice contrarily revealed resistance to uveitis and experimental autoimmune encephalitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and to date it remains unclear whether susceptibility to autoimmunity is dependent on the genetic background of the mice or other factors. Thus, the role of DEF6 in autoimmunity has remained controversial and partially enigmatic.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we uncover an inborn error of immunity caused by biallelic mutations in <italic>DEF6</italic> and characterized by early-onset systemic autoimmunity. We find impaired CTLA-4 availability and trafficking, due to decreased interaction of mutated DEF6 with the small GTPase RAB11, as the mechanistic basis for the autoimmune manifestations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Systemic autoimmunity in three patients from two families</title><p id="Par6">We studied three patients with severe autoimmune manifestations. Patient 1 is female (P1, Family A) born to consanguineous Pakistani parents (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) who presented with severe watery diarrhea in the first month of life. Endoscopy revealed atrophy of gastric mucosa and villous atrophy with pronounced T- and eosinophilic cell infiltration in the colon and duodenum (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Fig. S1a). Further disease features included hepatosplenomegaly, dilated cardiomyopathy, and increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections suggesting a primary immune defect (Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Immune phenotyping revealed reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and slightly reduced percentages of CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> (Fig. S1b) in the circulation. Immunoglobulin levels were not consistently altered (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), only few CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>−</sup> class-switched B cells were detected (Fig. S1c), and specific antibody responses were impaired (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Clinical signs of autoimmunity were paralleled by detectable anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and autoantibodies against cardiolipin, smooth muscle protein, and β2-glycoprotein (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). NK cells were in the normal range, and neutrophil function including oxidative burst as well as phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria was not impaired (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A serum cytokine/chemokine blot did not reveal elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines but rather reduced levels of serum IL-12 and IL-6 compared to a healthy control (Fig. S1d). Upon clinical deterioration of symptoms, we initiated CTLA-4-Ig (Abatacept) treatment at 4-weekly intervals starting at 15 months of age (Fig. S1e). Consequently, bowel inflammation decreased markedly as reflected by fecal calprotectin values (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Lymphocytic infiltration and complete villous atrophy of the duodenum improved within one month of treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). In addition, persisting perianal lesions reversed and did not recur (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). P1 was consequently discharged and treated as an outpatient (Fig. S1e). To date, ~4 years after treatment initiation, no overt signs of autoimmunity have reoccurred, and cardiorespiratory fitness has been stable without arrhythmias or other overt pathology. Regular immunoglobulin treatment is given. Recurrent infections requiring antibiotic treatment have persisted (Fig. S1e). The female sibling of P1 (patient 2 or P2) had been diagnosed earlier with a systemic autoimmune/autoinflammatory disease that included bowel inflammation, hepatomegaly, cholestasis, and cardiac ventricular septal defect. P2 also presented with recurrent infections and exhibited reduced numbers of lymphoid cells (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), however immunological investigations could not be performed in-depth since P2 died at 10.5 months of age due to cardiomyopathy-associated cardiac and multi-organ failure.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Systemic autoimmunity in three patients from two families. <bold>a</bold> Pedigree of families A and B.

Given the marked response of P1 to Abatacept (CTLA-4-Ig) treatment enabling clinical disease remission (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c–e</xref>), we hypothesized that autoimmunity in DEF6 deficiency may be linked to aberrant CTLA-4 regulation. Expression of CTLA-4 is predominantly regulated by FOXP3 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>) and calcium-dependent NFAT activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We first analyzed CTLA-4 upregulation in stimulated memory-T<sub>reg</sub> cells that most robustly express CTLA-4, and normalized the expression to unstimulated, naïve conventional T cells as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

P1 and P3 both showed slightly reduced FOXP3 levels in T<sub>regs</sub> (Fig. S1b and f). The checkpoint receptor CTLA-4 modulates T-cell responses through binding to and transendocytosis of the costimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 from APCs. While CD80/CD86 are degraded within T-cell lysosomes, CTLA-4 itself is recycled to the plasma membrane through the vesicular transport systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Defective CTLA-4 lysosomal sorting has been described previously to underlie autoimmunity in LRBA deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

To evaluate dynamic processes of CTLA-4 vesicular trafficking, we performed membrane cycling assays on primary T cells by comparing surface and cycled CTLA-4 normalized to total expressed CTLA-4, as outlined in schematic Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>. We observed reduced percentages of both surface and cycling CTLA-4 in all T-cell compartments of P3, including memory (CD45RA<sup>−</sup>) and naïve (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>), regulatory (FOXP3<sup>+</sup>) as well as conventional (FOXP3<sup>−</sup>) T cells, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c–e</xref> and Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3b–c</xref>, gating as in Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3d</xref>). Analysis of P1 and corresponding healthy donors revealed reduced CTLA-4 cycling in the memory compartments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d, e</xref>). Defects in CTLA-4 cycling were observed despite normal activation as evidenced by CD25 upregulation (Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3e</xref>). Comparing mean fluorescence intensities of cycled versus total CTLA-4 confirmed a relative reduction of cycling CTLA-4 in patient CD4 cells (Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3f</xref>).

While total CTLA-4 expression was unaffected, mobilized CTLA-4 was reduced in patient T cells compared to HD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, gating as in Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). In a similar setup, we electroporated healthy control or DEF6<sup>E331K</sup>-mutated PBMCs with wild type DEF6-GFP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) or mutated DEF6<sup>E331K</sup>-GFP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The observed mobilization defect of CTLA-4 in DEF6<sup>E331K</sup>-mutated CD4 T cells was reversed by wild-type DEF6 but not by DEF6<sup>E331K</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>, gating as in Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). To further prove causality, we generated CRISPR-mediated knockout clones of DEF6 and Renilla control in CTLA-4-mCherry transduced Jurkat cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Pronounced reduction of DEF6 expression resulted in defective CTLA-4 cycling, confirming the role of DEF6 in regulating CTLA-4 trafficking (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>, gating as in Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>).

We first assessed the localization of endogenous DEF6, RAB11 and CTLA-4 in activated patient-derived and control PBMCs. In line with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, we observed prominent co-localization of CTLA-4 with RAB11 in the healthy control cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>). In sharp contrast, RAB11/CTLA-4 co-localization was largely reduced in TCR/CD28-stimulated DEF6<sup>E331K</sup>-mutated cells of P1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Line scans through CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> vesicles confirmed the lack of co-localization with RAB11 in DEF6<sup>E331K</sup>-mutated cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). To quantify RAB11 and CTLA-4 co-localization, defined regions of interest with high CTLA-4 expression and RAB11-positive vesicles were selected and analyzed for overlap coefficients. Quantitative analyses revealed a significant reduction of co-localization for P1 and P3 compared to respective healthy control cells (Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5a-c</xref>), suggesting a negative impact of mutated/reduced DEF6 on CTLA-4<sup>+</sup>RAB11<sup>+</sup> recycling vesicles. Of note, RAB11 was expressed at similar levels in P1 and P3 as in healthy controls (Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5d</xref>). To validate changes in interaction of wildtype or mutated DEF6 with RAB11, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analyses in co-transfected HEK293T cells. While wildtype DEF6 co-immunoprecipitated with RAB11 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), this interaction was reduced in the DEF6<sup>E331K</sup>-expressing cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). These results suggest a possible GEF activity of wildtype DEF6 for the small GTPase RAB11, and could hence play a causative role in reduced recycling of CTLA-4 in patient cells. Consistent with the fact that GEF proteins for small GTPases interact preferentially with the dominant negative, GDP-bound form of their target proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, we found that DEF6 interacted strongly with dominant-negative (GDP-locked) RAB11<sup>S25N</sup>, but weakly with constitutively-active (GTP-bound) RAB11<sup>Q70L</sup> in HEK293T cells (Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5e</xref>). In contrast, DEF6<sup>E331K</sup> did not show relevant co-immunoprecipitation with wild-type, GDP- or GTP-locked RAB11 (Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5f</xref>, long exposure shown). In Jurkat cells, endogenous DEF6 co-immunoprecipitated with Strep-HA-tagged RAB11 but not with the Strep-HA-GFP-expressing control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>), confirming a physical interaction in a T-cell model. The second identified mutation DEF6<sup>Y210D</sup> was barely expressed in primary T cells of P3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), probably due to rapid degradation. We overexpressed GFP-tagged wildtype or Y210D-mutated DEF6 in Jurkat cells in presence or absence of proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and tracked GFP signals over time. Our data confirm loss of DEF6<sup>Y210D</sup> two days after transfection which could be fully reverted by adding MG132 (Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5g</xref>). Lastly, kinetic studies on purified proteins suggest that the PH-DH domain of DEF6 has GEF activity toward the small GTPase RAB11, while mutated PH-DH<sup>E331K</sup> is inactive (Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5h</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>DEF6 mutations affect RAB11 interactions. <bold>a</bold> Representative images of endogenous CTLA-4, and RAB11 and DEF6 in TCR-stimulated healthy control (HD) PBMCs showing RAB11-CTLA-4 co-localization. <bold>b</bold> Line scans of images in (<bold>a</bold>) reveal high overlap of RAB11 and CTLA-4 signal in activated HD-PBMCs.

We uncover a role for DEF6 in regulating abundance and recycling of the T-cell checkpoint protein CTLA-4, as the functional cause of the observed autoimmune manifestations in <italic>DEF6</italic>-mutated patients. We base our conclusions on the following observations and in line with previously outlined criteria:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (i) we identified different biallelic mutations in <italic>DEF6</italic> as the single common gene affected and segregating perfectly with the disease in two unrelated families; (ii) DEF6 has been previously shown to have a role in the immune system although its precise role in human immunity had not been determined; (iii) we identified a CTLA-4 trafficking defect amenable to rescue upon reconstitution of patient T cells with wildtype DEF6, explaining the predominant clinical presentation of autoimmunity; (iv) CRISPR-based <italic>DEF6</italic> knockout in Jurkat cells recapitulates defective CTLA-4 cycling and could be reverted by reconstitution with the wildtype protein; (v) we provide a functional explanation involving compromised RAB11-DEF6 interaction affecting RAB11-dependent CTLA-4 shuttling; (vi) lastly, the successfully commenced CTLA-4-Ig therapy in P1 led to remission of symptoms.</p><p id="Par18">CTLA-4 is a critical molecule in human immune homeostasis. A reduction of CTLA-4 levels by 50% as observed in CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency results in severe autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, while notably patients with biallelic loss-of-function germline mutations in <italic>CTLA4</italic> have not been described and are potentially lethal. <italic>Ctla4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice are viable, although they develop fatal autoimmunity early in life whereas their <italic>Ctla4</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> littermates are healthy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. These studies suggest that humans appear to have a narrower window of tolerance regarding CTLA-4 critical abundance for the onset of disease. This assumption is further supported by genome-wide association studies which have identified SNPs affecting the relative cell surface expression of CTLA-4 associated with human autoimmune disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Reduction of available CTLA-4 by enhanced lysosomal degradation is also the cause for severe autoimmunity in LRBA deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Again, in contrast to the human phenotype, <italic>Lrba</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice do not develop overt autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, have a normal lifespan and also intriguingly exhibit an increased acceptance of allogeneic bone marrow grafts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

Our discovery of a mechanistic link between <italic>DEF6</italic> mutations and CTLA-4 functional integrity offers insights to autoimmunity in humans. Clinical and immunological phenotypes in <italic>DEF6</italic>-mutated patients include T-cell lymphopenia, low class-switched B cells, hepatosplenomegaly, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and bowel inflammation, all of which are reminiscent of CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency and LRBA deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In accordance with previous reports on genetically determined autoimmune diseases through compromised CTLA-4, clinical manifestations vary between patients due to the lowered thresholds of inhibitory T cell function, rather than through specific triggers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Still, they do represent the same disease. As for other newly described disease entities, larger patient cohorts in future studies will help to unravel the full phenotypic spectrum of disease due to functional DEF6 deficiency. It is impossible to dissect whether the strong immunosuppressive treatment in P1 may have contributed to the more pronounced B-cell deficiency including borderline-low frequencies of class-switched memory B cells and impaired vaccination titer generation, and also the persistent susceptibility to infections which has been described previously in individuals treated with abatacept<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. To date, P3 has exhibited less pronounced autoimmune manifestations. This could be due to a distinct mutation with distinct cellular effect, or possibly a different genetic or epigenetic background. Given the reduced CTLA-4 expression in P3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), it is possible that other autoimmune manifestations may present with time. Interestingly, in contrast to CTLA-4 and LRBA-mutated patients, DEF6-mutated patients do not show an obvious activation/exhaustion phenotype in peripheral blood T cells. This might be due to the fact that DEF6 is also involved in T-cell signaling. Def6<sup>−/−</sup> mice, for example, exhibit a reduced clonal expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The interplay of DEF6 in T-cell signaling and regulation of CTLA-4 might result in a normal status of T cells derived from the blood, but increased activation in situ, where antigen is presented in higher concentrations as suggested by the massive T-cell infiltration in peripheral tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The homozygous frameshift mutation in <italic>SKIV2L</italic> that was additionally identified in P1 and the deceased sister P2 in family A (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>), could represent a disease-modifying factor potentially affecting cardiac function and/or bowel inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, but does not explain the autoimmune presentation observed in <italic>DEF6</italic>-mutated individuals from both families and our identified link to aberrant CTLA-4 shuttling. We proved causality by reconstitution of the CTLA-4 cycling defect in patient-derived cells through ectopic expression of wildtype DEF6, and a similar reconstitution of <italic>DEF6</italic>-knockout Jurkat models could revert the observed CTLA-4 cycling defect. Finally, the response of P1 to CTLA-4 replacement therapy suggests a T cell-mediated disease.</p><p id="Par19">The co-localization, co-immunoprecipitation and overexpression data confirm that DEF6 regulates CTLA-4 vesicular trafficking via the small GTPase RAB11. RAB11 has previously been located at recycling vesicles containing CTLA-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We identify a cellular regulation pathway of CTLA-4, which may involve direct activation of RAB11 by DEF6, a GEF protein that functions downstream of TCR engagement. RAB11 is a broadly expressed small GTPase and its deletion in a murine knockout model was found embryonically lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. It is also considered a crucial component of the so-called exocyst, which regulates late-endosomal trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. However, it is largely unknown which GEF proteins activate RAB11 to promote its multiple actions, and future studies are required to address this question. Our data reveal that RAB11 interacts with DEF6, and that DEF6 acts as GEF protein for RAB11 as suggested by a preferential interaction of DEF6 with the GDP-locked small GTPase, and further evidenced by kinetic GEF activity studies on purified protein domains. The phenocopy of defective CTLA-4 cycling by overexpressing inactive RAB11<sup>S25N</sup> in Jurkat cells further supports this theory. In patient-derived <italic>DEF6</italic>-mutant T cells, RAB11<sup>+</sup> recycling endosomes do not co-localize with CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> vesicles, suggesting that DEF6 promotes RAB11-mediated recycling of CTLA-4.</p><p id="Par20">In conclusion, our work identifies a role for DEF6 in regulating CTLA-4 availability and trafficking to prevent autoimmunity, in line with CTLA-4 functioning both as immune rheostat and defining thresholds of immune activation for anti-cancer immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.

A Caesarean section was performed at 38 weeks of gestation due to rupture of the membrane and pathological dopplersonographic measurements. Weight and length at birth were below third percentile (1435 g; 39 cm; head circumference 25.5 cm). No abnormalities were observed during the perinatal period, apart from mild respiratory distress syndrome. P1 presented hypertelorism, inward mamillae, growth retardation (below third percentile) and abnormal fatty tissue distribution. At 23 days of life severe watery diarrhea was observed, associated with vomiting and electrolytes imbalances (hypernatremia and hyperchloremic acidosis; Na: 159 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>, pH 7.1; base excess: −18) and massive increase of inflammation markers (C reactive protein concentration: &gt;20 mg dl<sup>−1</sup>). Total parenteral nutrition was initiated with no obvious improvements of diarrhea. Hydrolyzed formula also did not improve P1’s health status. Viral, bacterial, parasitic or allergic causes of the diarrhea were excluded upon repeated testing. Massive bowel inflammation was suggested by increased stool calprotectin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Endoscopy revealed atrophy of gastric mucosa with numerous apoptotic cells. Complete villous atrophy was also observed in the small intestine. Microvillus inclusion disease and an underlying metabolic disease were excluded. The duodenum showed massive infiltration of eosinophils and T cells (Fig. S1a). Plasma and goblet cell numbers were reduced. Colonic mucosa showed normal appearance. Subsequently, P1 developed perianal dermatitis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Topical treatment had no effect on the dermatitis and deep, indurated, painful ulcers evolved. Enteral feeding was offered, but led to massive vomiting. Thus, therapy with corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg kg<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup>) was initiated which showed slight improvement of disease status. Intravenous cyclosporine was added to the therapy. Enteral feeding was gradually increased through a jejunostomy. Vomiting ceased and stool consistency improved substantially. Parenteral nutrition could be withdrawn. With subsequent reduction of cyclosporine, watery diarrhea recurred leading to a loss of about 1.5 kg within two weeks. At the age of 2 months P1 presented hepatomegaly and laboratory liver abnormalities (elevated γ-glutamyl transferase (450 U l<sup>−1</sup>) and liver enzymes (AST/ALT: 100 U l<sup>−1</sup>)), which were treatable with ursodeoxycholic acid. Echocardiography imaging of P1 revealed a dilated cardiomyopathy with an atrial septal defect (ASD). Treatment with phosphodiesterase inhibitor and acetylsalicylic acid was initiated. Due to suspected vasculitis the patient further received intravenous immunoglobulins. P1 developed a biventricular hypertrophy, with an ASD. Treatment with enalapril, atenolol, spironolactone, and furosemide resulted in improved ventricular function, however, biventricular hypertrophy persisted and arterial hypertension developed. Due to reduced immunoglobulin levels after birth (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), the patient was supplemented with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for two months in which IgG/IgM/IgA levels were closely monitored.

She presented with a cleft palate. Enteral feeding was difficult due to clinical signs that were interpreted as necrotizing enterocolitis. Neither diet with extensively hydrolyzed formula nor with elemental formula improved her clinical condition, necessitating parenteral nutrition. Colonoscopy at the age of 138 days revealed rectal ulcers and remarkably few plasma cells and increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the descending and transverse colon. Rectal fissures and ulcers were detected. Mucosal membrane showed normal conditions. Besides the gastrointestinal symptoms, the patient was found to have an atrioventricular septum defect (AVSD) which was treated with pulmonary artery banding and VSD patch closure.
