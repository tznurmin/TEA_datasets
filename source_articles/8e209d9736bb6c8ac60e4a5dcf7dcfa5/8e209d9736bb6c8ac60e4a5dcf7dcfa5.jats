However, the mechanism of action of NC against HCC remains largely unclear. In this study, three pairs of NC-treated and NC-untreated HCC xenograft tumour tissues were collected for circRNA sequencing analysis. In total, 297 circRNAs were differently expressed between the two groups, with 188 upregulated and 109 downregulated, among which hsa_circ_0088364 and hsa_circ_0090049 were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The in vitro experiments showed that the two circRNAs inhibited the malignant biological behaviour of HCC, suggesting that they may play important roles in the development of HCC. To elucidate whether the two circRNAs function as “miRNA sponges” in HCC, we identified circRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA interactions by using the CircInteractome and miRwalk, respectively. Subsequently, 857 miRNA-associated differently expressed genes in HCC were selected for weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Module Eigengene turquoise with 423 genes was found to be significantly related to the survival time, pathology grade and TNM stage of HCC patients. Gene functional enrichment analysis showed that the 423 genes mainly functioned in DNA replication- and cell cycle-related biological processes and signalling cascades. Eighteen hubgenes (SMARCD1, CBX1, HCFC1, RBM12B, RCC2, NUP205, ECT2, PRIM2, RBM28, COPS7B, PRRC2A, GPR107, ANKRD52, TUBA1B, ATXN7L3, FUS, MCM8 and RACGAP1) associated with clinical outcomes of HCC patients were then identified. These findings showed that the crosstalk between hsa_circ_0088364 and hsa_circ_0090049 and their competing mRNAs may play important roles in HCC, providing interesting clues into the potential of circRNAs as therapeutic targets of NC in HCC.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC81860717,

Although surgery is the main treatment for HCC, most patients have developed advanced HCC at the time of diagnosis due to the atypical symptoms in the early stages, missing the ideal operation time. For patients with unresectable advanced HCC, pharmacotherapy is the primary therapeutic strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, due to drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and high rates of adverse side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, most conventional chemotherapeutic agents fail to produce satisfactory outcomes for HCC patients. Thus, the development of treatment methods that produce milder adverse side effects and can effectively prolong the survival time of patients with HCC has been the focus of research.</p><p id="Par3">Natural products have received increasing interest in exploration of novel antitumour therapeutic remedies because of their low side effects and extensive bioactivities. Nitidine chloride (NC), a major active ingredient that was isolated from the roots of the traditional Chinese medicine herb <italic>Zanthoxylum nitidum</italic> (Roxb) DC, has been demonstrated to have anticancer effects in human malignant tumours, including HCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms of action of NC against HCC remain largely unclear to date. Our research group has reported that NC may exert its anti-HCC role by targeting TOP1A and TOP2A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, but whether NC can fight HCC by other targets is still worth exploring.</p><p id="Par4">Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of transcripts without a 3′ tail and or 5′ cap, are naturally occurring endogenous ncRNAs with a covalently closed loop. Cumulative studies have highlighted the important roles of circRNAs in cancer occurrence and progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In our previous study, we identified two circRNAs (hsa_circRNA_100291 and hsa_circRNA_104515) that may be involved in the pathogenesis of HCC and revealed their prospects as therapeutic targets for anticancer drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, more studies are needed to verify the role of circRNAs in the pharmaceutical treatment of HCC.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we performed an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of circRNAs based on three pairs of NC-treated and NC-untreated HCC xenograft tumour tissues to identify circRNAs that may be potential targets for NC against hepatocarcinogenesis. Following the corroboration of the differently expressed circRNAs by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and the exploration of the biological function of the circRNAs by in vitro experiments, a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed by using a website-based computational biology strategy. Simultaneously, a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) along with Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of action of the circRNAs in HCC in depth. Altogether, these analyses provide novel insights into the possibility of circRNAs serving as targets of NC anti-HCC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>NC inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro</title><p id="Par6">To elucidate the inhibitory effect of NC on HCC cell proliferation, we performed a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay.

However, more experiments are needed to gain insights into the anti-HCC mechanism of NC.</p><p id="Par19">With the development of high-throughput RNA-seq technology, circRNAs have received increasing attention.

Knockdown of hsa_circ_0016788 inhibited the malignant biological behaviours of HCC cells in vitro and decrease tumour growth in vivo. These studies indicated the important roles of circRNAs in the initiation and progression of HCC, which provided novel insights into their application as therapeutic targets in HCC.</p><p id="Par20">Here, a circRNA sequencing analysis was firstly conducted based on three pairs of NC-treated and NC-untreated HCC xenograft tumour tissues. A total of 297 differently expressed circRNAs were observed between the two groups. Following RT-qPCR validation, we selected hsa_circ_0088364 and hsa_circ_0090049 for further study. The in vitro experiments showed that these two circRNAs inhibited the malignant biological behavior of HCC, suggesting that they may play important roles in the development of HCC. However, the molecular mechanism by which these two circRNAs promote HCC progression remains unknown. Growing evidence has shown that circRNAs contain a large amount of miRNA binding sites and play key roles as “miRNA sponges” in the pathogenesis and progression of human tumours. For example, cirRNA CDR1as contains more than 70 miRNA binding sites and acts as an miR-7 sponge in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. CircRNA NF1 functions as a miRNA sponge, accelerating gastric cancer progression by absorbing miR-16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. CircRNA circMTO1 represses bladder cancer metastasis by sequestering miR-21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. We have identified a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network that may contribute to the initiation and progression of HCC in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Here, we aimed to further investigate the role of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis in the treatment of HCC with NC. By using a computational biology analysis, 19 circRNA-miRNA interactions including two circRNAs (hsa_circ_0088364 and hsa_circ_0090049) and 18 miRNAs were identified. We then collected target mRNAs of the 18 miRNAs and intersected them with 4995 DEGs in HCC, obtaining 857 miRNA-associated DEGs. WGCNA analysis was performed based on the 857 genes to identify gene co-expression networks and their underlying clinical significances. WGCNA is a system-level method for identifying modules of highly correlated genes from microarray or RNA-seq datasets and for relating modules to clinical traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, which has been applied in various biological contexts, including cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In this study, we identified three modules of the 857 genes by using the WGCNA approach, among which MEturquoise with 423 genes showed close links with the survival time, pathology grade and TNM stage of patients with HCC. A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network containing two circRNAs (hsa_circ_0088364 and hsa_circ_0090049), 17 miRNAs and 423 genes was then constructed. To further elucidate the underlying biological function and action mechanism of the aforementioned regulatory network in HCC, we performed functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyses based on the 423 genes in MEturquoise. The results of the GO and KEGG analyses revealed that these genes were involved in DNA replication- and cell cycle-related biological processes and signalling cascades, suggesting their pivotal roles in HCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, we found that the 423 genes also participated in some other tumour-related pathways, such as “p53 signalling pathway” and “Viral carcinogenesis”.

Following in vitro experiments, we found that these two circRNAs play a role in the progression of HCC. Our findings provide interesting potential clues into the possibilities of circRNAs as therapeutic targets of NC in HCC. Nevertheless, we have not verified the biological function of the two circRNAs in HCC in vivo, nor have we determined how NC targets the two circRNA against HCC.
