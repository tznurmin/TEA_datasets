High-throughput DNA sequencing has delineated the structural and functional configurations of gut metagenomes in world populations. The microbiota of the Russian population is of particular interest to researchers, because Russia encompasses a uniquely wide range of environmental conditions and ethnogeographical cohorts. Here we conduct a shotgun metagenomic analysis of gut microbiota samples from 96 healthy Russian adult subjects, which reveals novel microbial community structures. The communities from several rural regions display similarities within each region and are dominated by the bacterial taxa associated with the healthy gut. Functional analysis shows that the metabolic pathways exhibiting differential abundance in the novel types are primarily associated with the trade-off between the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla. The specific signatures of the Russian gut microbiota are likely linked to the host diet, cultural habits and socioeconomic status.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">The structure of the human gut microbiota has been shown to vary between populations.

Its composition is influenced by genetics, the mode of delivery, diet, lifestyle, medical treatments and other factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The elucidation of global microbiota diversity is important for understanding the role of the microbiota in host health and for discovering ways to modulate the microbial community for disease prevention and treatment. Culture-independent methods, such as high-throughput DNA sequencing, provide insight into the total genomic composition (metagenome) of samples from both taxonomic and metabolic perspectives. Recently, several studies have produced large metagenomic data sets for the gut microbiota of populations from different countries. A catalogue of prevalent gut microbial genes was derived from the metagenomic analysis of stool samples obtained from 124 European individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Long-term diet was found to be one of the significant factors linked to microbiota composition in US subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Functions and structure of human gut microbiota were determined in a large cohort of US population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Distinctions in microbiota composition were discovered between European, United States, African and Amerindian populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Other national metagenomic initiatives include Irish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, Korean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and Chinese<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> populations. However, metagenomic studies performed in Russia are underrepresented.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we conduct a descriptive analysis of the gut microbiota of several diverse parts of Russian population using whole-genome sequencing. Although taxonomic analysis shows that the prevalent bacterial taxa are similar to those found in Western European and North American populations, we discovered novel community structures (dominated by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria) in healthy gut samples from Eastern Russia and rural regions. Gene repertoire analysis demonstrates that the novel community structures observed in the Russian metagenomes are distinctly enriched in functional pathways associated with Gram-positive Firmicutes. We suggest that further exploration of metagenomes in rural and remote areas will reveal even broader variation in community structures, representing historically stable variants of microbiota diversity before the widespread consumption of industrial food and antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Examination of the Russian microbiota</title><p id="Par5">We characterized the microbial communities of adult individuals living in metropolitan (<italic>n</italic>=50) and rural (<italic>n</italic>=46) areas by analysing stool samples (for the subject enrolment criteria, see Methods).

We expect that broader global sampling of the microbiota of local rural cohorts, including isolated communities, will identify even greater variability in gut microbial communities.

This information deepens our understanding of healthy human microbiome ecology and serves as a reference point for future epidemiological studies and translational applications. Moreover, we examined the Russian microbiota from a functional perspective, and although our results agree with earlier studies showing functional homeostasis independent of taxonomic composition, we also observed certain signatures related to carbohydrate metabolism. We further suggested possible explanations linking diet and lifestyle with microbial community functions and, finally, we showed that studying gut bacterial communities across regional cohorts with distinctive sociocultural features extends our knowledge of the landscape of healthy human gut microbiome diversity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Subject enrolment criteria</title><p id="Par30">The Ethics Committee of the Research Institute of Physico-Chemical Medicine approved the study protocol.

The tube was vortexed and the contents were homogenized by shaking on a Mini BeadBeater 16 (BioSpec Products) for 3 min with maximum intensity. The homogenized sample was incubated at 70 °C for 15 min and vortexed periodically. The tube was centrifuged for 20 min at 22,000 r.c.f.

Genome coverage by read alignment was used to estimate the relative abundance of the corresponding genera in a metagenomic sample. As each read was mapped once at most and some genomes of closely related strains in the reference set display similar sequences, the genome coverage depth was summed across the corresponding genus, such that the resulting profile described the abundance of genera, rather than that of species or strains.
