BVDV infection in cattle, despite having a wide range of clinical manifestations, is invariably responsible for significant economic losses. To counteract these losses, various schemes to control and eradicate BVDV have been implemented, although safe drugs effectively inhibiting the replication of the virus are still lacking. The purpose of this study was to characterize the antiviral effect of naturally occurring proteins and peptide, such as bovine lactoferrin, chicken egg lysozyme, and nisin from <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, used both individually and in combination, against the cytopathic NADL strain of BVDV in vitro. After determining the cytotoxicity level of each protein or peptide to MDBK cells, its antiviral effects were evaluated using virucidal, cytopathic effect inhibition and viral yield reduction assays. In addition, the influence of the tested compounds on the intracellular viral RNA level was determined.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The highest efficacy among the single treatments was achieved by bovine lactoferrin, which was effective both at the early stages of viral infection and during its entire course, although the effect weakened over time. Nisin and lysozyme were effective at later stages of infection, and the intensity of their effect did not diminish with time. Nisin+lactoferrin and lysozyme+lactoferrin combinations demonstrated stronger antiviral effects than did the single substances. The nisin+lactoferrin mixture present during the whole period of infection produced the strongest anti-BVDV effect in our entire research on both the extracellular viral titre (titre reduction up to 2.875 log ≈ 99.9%) and the intracellular viral RNA level (reduction up to 89%), and this effect intensified over the incubation time.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The tested substances could be applied in bovine viral diarrhoea prevention and therapy, especially when used in combination.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nisin</kwd><kwd>Lysozyme</kwd><kwd>Lactoferrin</kwd><kwd>Bovine viral diarrhoea virus</kwd><kwd>Antiviral</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Regional Initiative of Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">010/RID/2018/19</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12917_2019_Article_2067.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine &amp;

Two types of the virus, BVDV1 and BVDV2, are distinguished according to genome differences, while the changes caused in infected cells lead to the distinction between two biotypes: cytopathic (cp) and non-cytopathic (ncp) biotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Bovine viral diarrhoea affects cattle populations around the world and causes considerable economic losses due to reproductive disorders, low productivity and higher incidence of other infectious diseases among the affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The virus can cause acute infections with a mild or asymptomatic course, persistent infections and even fatal mucosal disease, and the virus biotype is crucial for the pathogenesis of an infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. More specifically, only the ncp biotype is responsible for persistent infections, whereas transient infections can be caused by either biotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Transient infection is associated with the isolation of low virus titres from affected cows and with a slowly growing level of specific antibodies. Infection of a seronegative female with an ncp BVDV strain between 40 and 120 days of gestation leads to the development of immunotolerance in the foetus and to persistent infection. Persistently infected (PI) animals are characterized by the absence of antibody production and the constant presence of high virus titres in the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Those individuals act as a reservoir of the virus and maintain it in the population due to constant BVDV shedding in all excretions and secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Both biotypes of the virus interfere with the mechanisms of innate and acquired immunity, elevating the affected animal’s predisposition to infections with other pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To reduce economic losses, BVDV control and eradication schemes have been implemented, and these entail identification of affected herds, removal of the virus from a herd by detection and elimination of PI animals, and prevention of re-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Vaccination is also practised; however, the presence of neutralizing antibodies does not eliminate virus shedding, nor does it reduce the number of BVD cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Various natural substances and synthetic compounds have been tested as potential anti-BVDV agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. High efficacy in vitro is achieved particularly by nucleoside analogues, but their administration is associated with negative side effects (cytotoxicity, immunosuppression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Naturally occurring substances (extracts from plants, animal tissues, fungi or bacteria) are characterized by greater biocompatibility and safety. Among the most frequently tested animal proteins are lactoferrin and lysozyme, both of which are factors of innate immunity that are produced in the granules of neutrophils and in the mucosal epithelium and are present in secretions of an organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multi-functional glycoprotein with a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus, rotavirus, norovirus, poliovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza A virus, hantavirus, human papillomavirus, feline calicivirus, bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), murine norovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus 71, echovirus 6, Japanese encephalitis virus, Sindbis virus and Semliki forest virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Lysozyme is an enzyme hydrolysing glycosidic linkages in bacterial peptidoglycan; due to the low toxicity of lysozyme, it is used as a natural preservative to control bacteria in meat products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The antiviral spectrum of lysozyme is considerably more modest than that of lactoferrin and mainly includes HSV1 and HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Nisin is a bacteriocin produced by some strains of <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> bacterium, a member of a class of thermostable cationic antibacterial peptides comprising atypical amino acid residues forming lanthionine rings called lantibiotics. In 1988, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave nisin a GRAS status (generally regarded as safe). Because nisin has a wide spectrum of antibacterial effects, it is used as a natural food preservative, especially in processed cheese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similar to lactoferrin and lysozyme, nisin is characterized by a positive charge, which can facilitate electrostatic interactions with the viral capsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To date, the antiviral activity of numerous bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria has been described, but the antiviral activity of nisin has not been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">The objective of this study was to characterize the antiviral effects of bovine lactoferrin, chicken egg lysozyme, and nisin from <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, both individually and in combination, on BVDV in vitro.

Although the viability of cells incubated with nisin at a concentration of 50 μg/ml was 90%, slight changes in the cell morphology were observed under a microscope after 5 days of culture; therefore, the maximum tolerable concentration (MTC) of nisin was assumed to be 25 μg/mL. This concentration and four subsequent concentrations, each twice as low as the previous concentration (12.5, 6.25, 3.125 and 1.56 μg/mL), were selected to test the anti-BVDV activity.

Lower concentrations were effective only during the first 24–48 h after inoculation. It was only the highest concentration of nisin (25 μg/mL) that remained effective throughout the entire experiment, and the intensity of its influence increased with the time of incubation (maximum reduction of the titre after 72 h, reaching 1.542 log at the post-adsorption stage, 1.417 log, at the adsorption + post-adsorption stage, i.e., by approximately 97 and 96%, respectively) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a).</p><p id="Par29">Lysozyme reduced the viral yield only when present in the culture medium throughout the entire duration of infection (adsorption+post-adsorption).

Similar to individual treatments, these mixtures led to effects that were proportional to the applied concentrations and that decreased with the incubation time. Only the intensity of the effect induced by the highest nisin+lactoferrin mixture concentration at the adsorption+post-adsorption stage intensified during the incubation time. This mixture concentration also caused the strongest anti-BVDV effect in our entire research (titre reduction by 2.583 log after 24 h, 2.792 log after 48 h and by 2.875 log after 72 h, i.e., by approximately 99.7, 99.8 and 99.9%, respectively).</p><p id="Par31">The mixture of nisin and lysozyme was characterized by the weakest efficacy.

This bacteriocin decreased both the extracellular virus titre and the amount of intracellular viral RNA. The best effect was observed when nisin was present throughout the entire duration of viral infection (adsorption+post-adsorption), although the application of the peptide only at the post-adsorption stage also produced a desirable effect, and its intensity did not weaken with the incubation time.</p><p id="Par34">The potential antiviral activity of nisin has been tested mainly in the context of its virucidal activity in food. In the experiment by Ly-Chatain et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], only very high concentrations of nisin (100,000 IU, i.e., 25 mg) after 10 min of contact decreased the titres of bacteriophages c2 and MS2 by 1 log. In the research performed by Lange-Starke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], nisin did not demonstrate any effect against murine norovirus S99, influenza A virus A/WSN/33, Newcastle disease virus Montana and feline herpesvirus KS 285, even after a three-day contact at a temperature of 24 °C. These results agree with the lack of antiviral activity of nisin shown in our experiment (concentrations up to 25 μg/mL, contact time up to 60 min, range of temperatures 4–37 °C).</p><p id="Par35">The only experiment in which the anti-cytomegalovirus effect of nisin was tested in the cytopathic effect inhibition assay verified the antiviral activity of nisin, showing an IC<sub>50</sub> (inhibitory concentration) of 255 μg/mL. The CC<sub>50</sub> concentration of nisin against human foetal lung fibroblasts was &gt; 2 mg/mL. Unfortunately, the researchers did not state explicitly at which stage of a viral infection nisin was effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In our study, the EC<sub>50</sub> of nisin was much lower (approximately 12 μg/mL), similar to its CC<sub>50</sub> (167 μg/mL). A possible cause of these discrepancies is a different level of susceptibility of the model cells and the virus used in both studies.</p><p id="Par36">Lysozyme was characterized by the weakest anti-BVDV effect among all the tested compounds. Similar to nisin, lysozyme did not enter into direct interactions with the virus or with the cell, nor did it inhibit viral adsorption. To reduce the virus titre and viral RNA amount, the enzyme had to be present throughout the whole course of viral infection (adsorption+post-adsorption), and the intensity of its impact increased with the incubation time. Most of the available literature focuses on the antiviral activity of lysozyme against herpes simplex virus and human immunodeficiency virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], although there are also reports negating the anti-HSV-1 effect of this enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The anti-HIV-1 activity of lysozyme is ascribed to its direct interaction with the virus (the blockade of viral fusion protein gp41) or with the cell (the blockade of CD4 receptor on lymphocytes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It was only in the experiment by Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that lysozyme produced by the marine strain of bacteria from the genus <italic>Bacillus</italic> inhibited the replication of pseudorabies virus in porcine kidney cells PK-15, not via direct interactions with the virus or the cell but during/after the infection of a cell, which is in keeping with our results. The CC<sub>50</sub> and EC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of the bacterial lysozyme were considerably lower (100 μg/mL and 0.46 μg/mL, respectively) than the analogous concentrations achieved in our experiment (9.25 mg/mL and 0.516 mg/mL).</p><p id="Par37">Bovine lactoferrin was characterized by the broadest spectrum of action among all tested compounds. Similar to the other proteins, LF did not demonstrate virucidal activity, but it was the only substance that had a protective effect on the cell and inhibited the adsorption of the virus. Interestingly, LF also produced a strong effect when it was present during the entire course of infection, despite being inactive at the post-adsorption step alone. Unlike nisin and lysozyme, the anti-BVDV effect of lactoferrin weakened with time. The results obtained in our experiment agree with the wealth of data in the literature concerning the antiviral activity of LF, which suggest that the protein usually prevents viral infection at its early stage by binding directly to the viral particles or to the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Depending on an experimental model, different ranges of effective concentrations of lactoferrin have been identified in in vitro studies, although EC<sub>50</sub> typically was no more than 1 mg/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], as in our experiment. Fewer papers also implicate lactoferrin can inhibit the intracellular stages of viral replication. For example, Välimaa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] confirmed the antiviral activity of LF against HSV-1 at different replication cycle stages (preincubation with virus or cells, adsorption and post-adsorption), with EC<sub>50</sub> values before adsorption being lower (100–250 μg/mL) than those observed after the adsorption of the virus (250–500 μg/mL).</p><p id="Par38">The only bovine virus against which the antiviral activity of lactoferrin has been tested is bovine herpesvirus 1 which, similar to BVDV, is widespread in cattle populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the cited study, however, considerably higher concentrations of lactoferrin (1.25–10 mg/mL) were tested than in our experiment. The concentration of 10 mg/mL decreased the amount of PFU BoHV-1 by 99%, while lower concentrations caused a 90–99% reduction. According to the quoted authors, this range of concentrations was not toxic to MDBK cells after 120 h of incubation, whereas in our study, the CC<sub>50</sub> of lactoferrin was 4.9 mg/mL, and the concentration of 10 mg/mL lowered the viability of MDBK cells by over 75%.</p><p id="Par39">The activity of bovine lactoferrin against hepatitis C virus has also been described. BVDV is sometimes used in research as a surrogate model of HCV replication in vitro. Both of these viruses belong to the same family and share many structural, functional and genomic features. However, the propagation of HCV in vitro is a highly demanding undertaking, while BVDV culture is rapid and easy to perform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The mechanism of action of lactoferrin against BVDV demonstrated in our study differed from the mechanism of its action against HCV described by Ikeda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. LF inhibited the HCV entrance into human hepatocytes and T lymphocytes owing to the direct interaction with the virus, while preincubation of cells or addition of the protein after inoculation produced no effect. Inactivation of HCV was an effect of LF interacting with the viral envelope proteins (E1 and E2). It is possible that the similarity between HCV and BVDV is insufficient for a similar mechanism of lactoferrin’s antiviral activity to arise, since both viruses belong to two different genera of <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, <italic>Pestivirus</italic> (BVDV) and <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> (HCV).</p><p id="Par40">The nisin+lactoferrin and lysozyme+lactoferrin mixtures were distinguished by being more effective against BVDV than single proteins, despite being tested in lower concentrations. This result was unsurprising because it is known that co-administration of substances with different mechanisms of action can intensify their activity and allow one to decrease a therapeutic dose which, in turn, helps to minimize side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nisin and lysozyme are safe natural food preservatives, while lactoferrin is a safe commercial nutraceutical. All of these compounds could be an alternative to synthetic antimicrobials, either as substitutes or as supplementary treatments in the standard therapy, and LF as a modulator of the immune system could also have a positive influence on the course of infection by enhancing the immunological response of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and this effect may be particularly important in the case of viruses causing immunosuppression, such as BVDV. To the best of our knowledge, these proteins and peptide have not been tested in combination to determine their antiviral effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">All the tested substances demonstrated anti-BVDV effects in vitro, although the effects varied in intensity and at different steps of the infection of cells. The highest efficacy among the single treatments was shown by bovine lactoferrin, which was effective at both the early steps and throughout the entire course of infection. However, its effects waned with time. Nisin and lysozyme were effective at later steps of infection than lactoferrin, and the intensity of their influence did not decrease with time. The nisin+lactoferrin and lysozyme+lactoferrin mixtures resulted in a more intensive antiviral effect at lower concentrations of the tested substances. The nisin+lactoferrin mixture present throughout the whole course of infection produced the strongest anti-BVDV effect in our entire research on both the extracellular viral titre and the intracellular viral RNA level, and its impact on the viral yield grew stronger with the time of incubation. Owing to the low toxicity and decent selectivity index of the tested substances, they could be used in prophylaxis (protecting the cell) or in BVDV therapy (inhibition of viral replication), especially in combination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cells and virus</title><p id="Par42">Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK, ATCC CCL-22) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 1% non-essential amino acid solution and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (all reagents purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par43">The cytopathic strain of bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (NADL strain, ATCC VR-534) was propagated and titrated in MDBK cells and stored at − 80 °C until use.
