Antibiotics are routinely used either to treat acute episodes or prevent recurrence; however, they occasionally fail to resolve the infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Recurence can be due to reinfection or persistence of bacteria. Bacterial survival during antibiotic treatment is generally thought to be facilitated by the formation of quiescent intracellular reservoirs of persister cells in the epithelium of the bladder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Following antibiotic withdrawal, the bacteria can resume replication, causing full-blown infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Bacterial cells are normally surrounded by a highly conserved structure called the cell wall. This layer, composed of peptidoglycan, defines their shape, facilitates regular division and protects from environmental factors, including changes in osmolarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Cell-wall components are recognised by the immune system and act as key indicators of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The cell wall is also a target for immune effectors, such as lysozyme, as well as for some of our best and most commonly used antibiotics, particularly β-lactams, such as penicillins and cephalosporins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Several scientific reports from the 1960s to 1980s suggested that bacteria causing rUTI might survive treatment with cell-wall-specific antibiotics by adopting a cell-wall-deficient or L-form state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, these reports were mainly unconvincing, primarily due to the lack of molecular diagnostic tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Also, L-forms are almost completely overlooked in clinical settings because routine microbiological culture media are hypotonic and do not support L-form growth. We recently demonstrated that the L-form state can be induced by cells of the immune system in tissue culture, as well as in an animal model, rendering the bacteria resistant to cell-wall-targeting antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In this report we show that L-forms are prevalent in older individuals suffering from rUTI. Furthermore, we demonstrate, in both urine and transparent zebrafish larvae, that <italic>E. coli</italic> strains isolated from these older patients can readily be induced to switch into the L-form state, to survive and divide, and then efficiently switch back into the walled state, potentially providing a route to the recurrence of infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>L-forms frequently occur in elderly rUTI patients</title><p id="Par6">In a study described in detail elsewhere, 30 elderly patients suffering from rUTI donated samples of urine every 2 weeks over a period of 6 months, generating a bank of 360 samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Ability to pass through 0.45 μm cut off filters, which block the passage of walled forms of pathogens, has been used to detect L-forms in various settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. A portion (2 ml) of each urine sample was filtered into semi-liquid osmoprotective media and incubated for up to 1 month. In many of the samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), growth detectable by eye appeared within 1–2 weeks, with some appearing after 3 days. Microscopically the bacteria resembled rods or cocci, which most likely originated from L-forms that passed through the filter, reverted to the walled state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and resumed division by conventional binary fission (see also below). It is possible that immune factors or antibiotics which induced those L-forms in vivo, were sufficiently diluted or inactivated following filtration, which allowed bacteria to rebuild the wall. Given the slow emergence of growth it is improbable that this originated from passage of walled bacteria through damaged filters. Also, given the heavy bacterial load in most samples (typically around 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>5</sup> viable bacteria per ml<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>), filter breakage would have led to much higher rates and levels of growths in the cultures than was seen. In control experiments cultures of walled <italic>E. coli</italic> did not detectably pass through the filters (which are generally used to sterilise solutions that cannot be autoclaved). Also, the recovery of <italic>E. coli</italic> L-forms (strain BW25113, induced under laboratory conditions) after filtration was inefficient (~41%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> L), probably because most of the cells burst or were otherwise damaged by pressure and or torinal stress during filtration, so the number of positive samples was probably underestimated.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Prevalence of L-forms in older patients with recurrent UTIs. <bold>a</bold> Samples assessed by filtration.

The L-forms initially went through several rounds of typical irregular divisions. After 40 min, cells with an elongated shape and of approximately normal diameter for walled cells began to appear. Some of the L-forms contained appendages protruding in different directions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> magenta arrow). The tubular cells elongated and eventually began to divide by the classical binary fission characteristic of walled cells. The initial L-form to rod transition required only about 1.5 h of growth following withdrawal of phosphomycin and after 5 h virtually all bacteria in the field of view had returned to the walled state. Similar results were obtained for other strains, e.g. ST144 (Supplementary Movies <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Urine supports L-form switching</title><p id="Par15">L-form switching would only be relevant to the clinical situation if the L-forms were viable in urine or tissues. One of the concerns is whether those environments could provide sufficient osmoprotection for L-form survival. The osmolality of urine of a healthy individual oscillates between about 400 and 800 mOsm/kg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, similar to that of the osmoprotective media we use to grow L-forms (500 mOsm/l). To test whether patient isolates have the potential to survive as L-forms in urine, we placed walled ST144 bacteria on an agarose pad made with the filtered urine of a healthy individual supplemented with phosphomycin and observed the cells by time-lapse microscopy. Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM11">7</xref> shows that the bacteria were able to switch into the L-form state, and that they could proliferate, albeit less efficiently than in optimised L-form growth media (most likely due to lower nutrient levels in urine). To test cell viability and their potential to regenerate the wall, we placed ST144 L-forms in liquid filtered urine supplemented with phosphomycin and incubated overnight. The presence of intact L-forms the next day was confirmed by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). The L-forms were plated on media with and without osmoprotection and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A lawn of small variable colonies emerged only on the osmoprotective plates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>). Microscopic examination revealed predominantly walled bacteria, though L-forms and intermediate types were also observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). These bacteria could now grow well on non-osmoprotective medium showing that they had switched back to the walled state. These results demonstrate that L-forms of bacteria isolated from a patient with rUTI can survive in urine in the presence of phosphomycin and are able to regenerate their cell wall following antibiotic withdrawal (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>).

This morphological switching, which could indicate progression to L-form or dying cells, could have occurred spontaneously or have been due to the activity of host phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, that damage the bacterial cell wall.

Although, many of these patients were treated with cell-wall-active antibiotics this cannot explain their presence in samples taken during periods with no antibiotic treatment. We have recently shown that immune effectors such as lysozyme can actually promote the L-form switch, at least for several Gram-positive bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The occasional detection of rounded cells in the zebrafish experiments would be consistent with innate-immune generation of L-forms. Although the zebrafish model is useful for visualising the walled to L-form transition in vivo, mammalian models will be needed to characterise the possible role of the L-form in recurrent infection going forward. Ultimately, larger scale trials focused specifically on culture negative patients treated with cell-wall-targeting antibiotics will be required to directly establish the extent to which L-form switching contributes to antibiotic evasion.</p><p id="Par20">Aside from antibiotic evasion (discussed below) L-form bacteria may also benefit from being less susceptible to innate-immune killing than walled cells. Although they may still be susceptible to other arms of the immune system, for example antimicrobial peptides or immune response stimulated by LPS, they presumably do not trigger innate-immune receptors specific for cell-wall components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Overall, it seems likely that the immune stimulation by L-forms is less than that exerted by walled bacteria. It is conceivable that L-forms can survive particularly well in immunocompromised or older patients.</p><p id="Par21">One of the most significant implications of this study is that, along other mechanisms used by bacteria to recur, L-forms could provide a source of bacterial survivors during treatment with cell-wall-specific antibiotics, independent of the need to acquire specific resistance genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). Instead, the antibiotic target (the cell wall) is temporally removed and its requirement for survival bypassed. Unlike previously described dormant persister cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, L-forms can continue to proliferate during what can be long (typically 5–14 days) periods of antibiotic treatment. Most importantly, we directly show that L-form bacteria induced by the presence of antibiotic in urine or zebrafish larvae are able to revert to a walled state once the antibiotic is removed. Beyond rUTI it now seems plausible that L-form switching might be an underappreciated mechanism of antibiotic tolerance by bacteria in other recurrent or chronic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

For patient UTI343, 20 colonies were subjected to MLST sequencing prior to and after filtration. Samples of fresh urine (500 µl) were concentrated 20× by centrifugation at 8000 × <italic>g</italic> for 2 min and a 1 µl volume from each sample was examined immediately by phase contrast microscopy. Samples of 250 µl urine were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Paraformaldehyde was removed and the samples were stored in 50% ethanol/50% PBS at −20 °C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Zebrafish injections</title><p id="Par26">All zebrafish experiments were performed using wild-type AB zebrafish. ﻿Eggs were obtained from naturally spawning zebrafish and embryos were reared in Petri dishes, at 28.5 °C in embryo medium (0.5X E2) supplemented with 0.3 µg/ml methylene blue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. For injections and live imaging, 3 days post fertilisation (dpf) larvae were anaesthetised with 200 µg/ml tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich) in embryo medium. During in vivo microscopy, larvae were maintained in a 33 °C atmosphere, for optimal conditions for bacterial replication. Bacterial strain ST144-YFP was cultured overnight in liquid NB, supplemented with 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol, and sub-cultured to exponential phase (OD<sub>A600</sub> = 0.6). For L-forms injections, sub-cultures in NB were supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml phosphomycin. To prepare the inoculum for injection, the suspension was centrifuged for 4 min at 4000 × <italic>g</italic>, washed and resuspended in PBS to 10,000 CFU/nl. Larvae were injected with 1–2 nl of bacterial suspension in the tail fin. For induction of L-forms in vivo, 0.4 mg/ml phosphomycin was injected intravenously (1 nl) and added to the embryo medium containing anaesthetic. Larvae were sacrificed in tricaine and mechanically disrupted in LM liquid media at the indicated time points. For recovery experiment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>), homogenates were serially diluted and plated onto NA, supplemented with 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol, to recover rod bacteria.
