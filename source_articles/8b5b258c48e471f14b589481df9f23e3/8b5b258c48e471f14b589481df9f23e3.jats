Despite several decades of research, no vaccine has been licensed whereas inactivated vaccines have been shown to induce severe adverse reaction in a clinical trial, with other forms of RSV vaccine also found to induce enhanced disease in preclinical animal studies. While arguably the cotton rat is the best small animal model for evaluation of RSV vaccines and antivirals, many important genes of the immune system remain to be isolated. Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) plays an integral role in regulating many aspects of immunity by inducing suppressive signals. In this study, we report the isolation of mRNA encoding the cotton rat PD-1 (crPD-1) and characterization of the PD-1 protein. crPD-1 bound to its cognate ligand on dendritic cells and effectively suppressed cytokine secretion. Moreover, using the newly acquired gene sequence, we observed a decreased level of crPD-1 levels in cotton rats with enhanced respiratory disease induced by inactivated RSV vaccine, unraveling a new facet of vaccine-induced disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Government of Canada (Gouvernement du Canada)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000023</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_48225.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is a receptor that belongs to the CD28 superfamily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein composed of an IgV domain that exists as a monomer on the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Upon engagement of one of its two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, it delivers negative signals in the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. When induced, PD-1 pathways play crucial roles in regulation of autoimmunity, transplantation immunity, infectious immunity and tumor immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">PD-1 expression is tightly regulated. Low basal levels are maintained on resting naïve T cells and some developing thymocytes which creates immune tolerance preventing autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Following activation, PD-1 is transiently expressed on multiple immune cells such as CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, macrophages, natural killer cells and dendritic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. High expression is vital for regulatory T cell development while follicular helper T cells constitutively express high PD-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The role of PD-1 in regulating T cell exhaustion during cancer and chronic infection is well established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Specifically, PD-1 expression is upregulated on virus-specific T cells during chronic viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The constant antigen exposure and prolonged T cell receptor stimulation leads to high levels of PD-1 and therefore, T cell exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Several studies involving a wide range of animal models and virus infections have demonstrated the importance of the PD-1 pathway. In non-human primates, blocking PD-1 resulted in rapid expansion of SIV-specific T cells drastically decreasing plasma viral load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, in mice, blocking the PD-1 pathway restored cytokine production, increased the number of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-specific T cells and enhanced viral clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In contrast, blocking PD-1 pathway during a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in mice enhanced pulmonary inflammation and lung injury with modest effects on viral clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> with about 50% of children being infected in their first year of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. RSV also causes severe disease in the elderly and immune-compromised patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In the 1960s, a clinical trial involving formaldehyde-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) resulted in hospitalization of 80% of the participants and 2 deaths following a RSV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This severe adverse reaction, commonly known as vaccine-induced enhanced respiratory disease (ERD), is yet to be fully understood but might be linked to the induction of a Th2-biased immune response leading to pulmonary inflammation, airway obstruction and mucus hypersecretion as observed in the trial participants and some animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6"><italic>Sigmodon hispidus</italic> (cotton rats) share many similarities in pathology with humans when infected by RSV. Notably, most findings in relation to FI-RSV induced ERD have been replicated in the cotton rats, making them one of the ideal animal models for RSV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Indeed, cotton rats have proven very useful in the study of human respiratory virus infections including the development and testing of antiviral drugs and vaccines for RSV, measles, influenza, human parainfluenza and human metapneumovirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. However, one of the major drawbacks with this animal model is the availability of research reagents because the genome has not been fully sequenced. As of today, approximately 300 genes have been sequenced in cotton rats that show 75–95% identity to mice and about 50% to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, while few genes of the immune system have been sequenced. With increasing number of vaccines and therapeutics being evaluated in cotton rats prior to clinical trials, it would be important to better understand the immune system of this animal model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">It has been shown that PD1-PDL1 activation is vital for limiting immunopathology in the context of a primary RSV infection in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. However, there have been no studies on the levels of PD-1 in cotton rats experiencing vaccine-induced ERD. Here, we report the isolation of cotton rat PD-1 (crPD-1) gene and characterization of the putative PD-1 protein. Using the newly identified gene sequence as a probe, we found significantly decreased levels of the PD-1 gene in ERD cotton rats following vaccination with FI-RSV, suggesting that downregulation of PD-1 could be associated with excessive pulmonary inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of cotton rat PD-1 sequence, species alignment and putative domains</title><p id="Par8">The mRNA sequence of cotton rat programmed cell death receptor-1 (crPD-1) was isolated from cotton rat spleens (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Following His-tag purification, protein expression was confirmed using western blot with anti-His antibody (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>), mass spectrometry (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>) and immunofluorescence staining of transfected cells with both anti-PD1 and anti-His antibodies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>).

To this end, DCs were incubated with purified crPD-1 or rmPD-1 for 4 hours. Following incubation, the DCs were stained with a viability dye and an anti-human/mouse PD-L1 blocking antibody for flow cytometry analysis. A competitive binding strategy summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> (left) was applied, i.e. if the added PD-1 protein was in its functional conformation, it would bind to PD-L1 expressed on the DCs preventing the PD-L1 blocking antibody from binding to the ligand resulting in lower fluorescence than cells not treated with a PD-1 receptor. However, if PD-1 cannot bind PD-L1 or binds with low affinity, the PD-L1 antibody would bind its epitope and, as a result, fluorescence would be quantitatively detected. Our results show that among viable cells, the detected mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of PD-L1 significantly decreased with the addition of crPD-1 (p = 0.039) and rmPD-1 (p = 0.04) compared to no treatment control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>).

Some positive cells observed in the untreated control reflect the background associated with the PE-conjugated secondary antibody. Furthermore, it is interesting to note the higher positive cell count in the crPD-1 stimulated group compared to rmPD-1 group. This observation is yet to be understood but likely due to the full-length crPD-1 which may have bound stronger to the antibodies used than the rmPD-1, which is a commercially available truncated form of the mouse protein. Nevertheless, these results confirm that the expressed crPD-1 protein is capable of binding to its cognate ligand.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>crPD-1 binds PD-L1 on dendritic cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Given the increasing popularity of the cotton rat model for the study of respiratory infection and immunological regulation, in depth characterization of crPD-1 biological activities should be conducted in comparison with PD-1 derived from other animal species and humans, which is ongoing in our laboratory.</p><p id="Par22">With the newly isolated crPD-1 gene as a molecular probe, we determined the expression of crPD-1 in the lungs of wild-type RSV and FI-RSV immunized cotton rats following RSV challenge.

Importantly, we found significant downregulation of PD-1 in the FI-RSV group at the mRNA and protein level, whereas the level of PD-1 remained unchanged in other groups including live RSV vaccination and primary infection controls, PBS and FI-Mock (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

Taken together, these observations indicate that PD-1, while not implicated in viral clearance, may have significantly contributed to exaggerated pulmonary pathology and ERD. It is of note that the mRNA and protein levels were analyzed five days post RSV challenge, given this time point is the peak of infection in cotton rats. Future studies should be considered to evaluate the mRNA and protein levels at different time points post challenge as reported by other investigators studying the relationship between PD-1 expression and RSV infection in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">While this is the first report of PD-1 expression levels evaluated in the context of RSV vaccine-induced ERD, the relationship of reduced levels of PD-1 and enhanced pulmonary pathology could also be corroborated by findings from the mouse model of severe RSV infection.

Indeed, the engagement of PD-1 with inflammatory DC-derived PD-L1 is crucial for regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine release by effector CD4 and CD8 T cells, resulting in control of effector T cell activities in the lungs.
