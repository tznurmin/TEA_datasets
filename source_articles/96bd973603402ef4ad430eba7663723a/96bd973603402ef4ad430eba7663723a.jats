In this study, we sought to compare modified metabolism of biofilm and planktonic populations with UTI89, a predominant agent of urinary tract infection, by combining mass spectrometry based untargeted and targeted metabolomics methods, as well as cytological visualization, which enable us to identify the driven metabolites and associated metabolic pathways underlying biofilm formation. Surprisingly, our finding revealed distinct differences in both phenotypic morphology and metabolism between two patterns. Furthermore, we identified and characterized 38 differential metabolites and associated three metabolic pathways involving glycerolipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism that were altered mostly during biofilm formation. This discovery in metabolic phenotyping permitted biofilm formation shall provide us a novel insight into the dissociation of biofilm, which enable to develop novel biofilm based treatments against pathogen causing infections, with lower antibiotic resistance.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the

biofilms are fundamentally structured in a manner of a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) with the extracellular DNAs, proteins and polysaccharides<sup><xref

Biofilm formation drives the bacterial cells to persist survival and prolong their life-span, which has been observed to play a key role in many human infections with high-frequency antibiotic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is a common, high-recurrence or even life-threaten infectious disease, which is mostly caused by uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC). UPEC prefers to form biofilm and trigger the infections recurrently, thereby leading to uneasily eradicate UPEC strains by the treatment of antibiotics against UTI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Basically, biofilm formations of bacteria have distinct stages involving attachment, micro colony formation and maturation, which are almost agreeable among different bacterial species. However, it still remains unclear if small-molecule metabolites and associated metabolism were required for biofilm formation and degradation. Our previous work verified that modified metabolism was observed to closely associate with the virulence expression of UPEC strains so as to promote the progression of UTIs, herein, reprogrammed metabolism might be the key factor for biofilm formation in terms of such structure directly contributes to high-pathogenicity and recurrence of UPEC strains during causing infections. Pellicle is a classical growth-mode of biofilm <italic>in in vitro</italic>, which is formed at the air-liquid interface without anchoring themselves to any solid surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

We were first to confirm whether biofilm pellicle model was successful or not in our study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), we employed the cytological method including Crystal Violet Staining, TEM (transmission electron microscope) and SEM (scanning electron microscope), to investigate the intricate-structure phenotype of biofilm formation, as it was expectedly found that pellicle biofilm have an organized and complex extracellular matrix-structure that encased individual, and spatially segregated bacterial-subpopulations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E,F</xref>), but such phenotype disappeared in the relevant planktonic-subpopulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C,D</xref>). This result was completely consistent with previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The imaging assay surely confirmed the biofilm pellicle model was successfully established in this study. In addition, staining technologies such as crystal violet and congo red were used to quantitatively assess the biofilm formation that was also significantly different from the planktonic population (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Those phenotypic observations may suggest us there is modified metabolism in two conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Distinctly metabolic modifications were observed in both biofilm formation and associated planktonic-population</title><p id="Par14">Metabolomics is an systems-biology driven omics method that was designed to global profiling all the small-molecule metabolites, whose level changes are capable of capturing and snapshotting different biological events and processes in cells with a diverse biological contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. To investigate reprogrammed-metabolism underlying biofilm formation, we explored one combinational strategy with untargeted and targeted metabolomics for deciphering the distinct metabolism that was critical for biofilm formation. Metabolome assay revealed that distinctly metabolic reprogramming during biofilm formation, which is significantly different from that in planktonic population (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). From the score plot resulted from PLS-DA analysis of metabolome data harvested by LC/MS/MS system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), we can see principal component 1 (PC-1) accounted for 31.3% of the variance, with PC-2 explaining 34%. The score plot by GC/MS based metabolome assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>) indicated, principal component 1 (PC1) explained 58.9% of variance, with PC2 of 18.4%, which exhibit the greatest difference predominantly along the PC-1 analysis. Global metabolome result was also illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>. Those results revealed remarkable metabolic-differentiation between biofilm formation and planktonic-subpopulation, while bacterial cells were switched to form biofilm, they could secret the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), which can be used to protect biofilm to defense environment insults and difficult to dissolution. Although our TEM images only recognize the denser layer of fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> (highlighted in red in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E,F</xref>) surrounding bacteria in biofilm pellicle mode, many other components (eDNA, proteins and polysaccharides, <italic>etc</italic>) present in EPS structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> which were disappeared in planktonic population. We deduced that microbes are capable of sensing the density of microenvironment as well as releasing the signal to change the gene expression and further yielding the influence upon bacterial metabolism. Consequently, reprogrammed-metabolism would have feedback to the modification with morphological features of the biofilm. In addition, the data also suggested that there was a mechanistic association between biofilm metabolism and its’ morphological feature.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Metabolome assay revealed distinctly modified metabolism between biofilm and planktonic population.

Here, we further combined the open-source databases with local database to identify the pivotal metabolites and associated metabolic pathways that have capacity to drive the biofilm formation while compared to planktonic cells. Unexpectedly, we successfully identified 38 differential metabolites, including amino acids, carbohydrates, organic acids, glycerol-derived, polyamine and uridine between biofilm pellicle and planktonic cell (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). It was an amazing discovery as glycerol-derived metabolites (2-Phosphoglyceric acid, Glycerol 3-phosphate and D-Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) were significantly up-regulated during biofilm formation while the glycerol was decreased considerably. Similarly, we also found that the levels of carbohydrates were enhanced clearly except that the levels of D-Maltose and D-Glucose were decreased in biofilm formation in relevant to that in planktonic cells. The level changes of other differential metabolites in both modes were showed in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Next, to home those differential metabolites to their metabolic pathways, we subjected them to metaboanalyst online to annotate associated metabolic pathways (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). What metabolism we expected that were mostly reprogrammed that involved glycolipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism, which were observed to markedly drive biofilm formation as most of differential metabolites were up-regulated accordingly (highlighted in blue in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Identifies and their level changes of differential metabolites underlying metabolic reprogramming during biofilm formation while compared to planktonic population.

Several amino acids were documented to account for biofilm detachment and maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, the mixture of D-Amino acids would lead to the biofilm desperation with <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and further break down the biofilm by YqxM protein which regulated the amyloid fibers anchoring or off-anchoring to the host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, our results only found the levels of many L-amino acids rather than D- amino acids were sharply changed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>), which might reveal the L-amino acids may be also participated in biofilm formation induced by UTI89<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> while D-amino acids were catalyzed as dispensable nutrition for bacteria growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, we also noticed that the level changes of different amino acids were extremely distinct between biofilm and planktonic cells. This unregularly phenomenon supported again that amino acids may specially play their individual roles in biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Metabolic reprogramming of amino acids in this study was confirmed again to mostly trigger biofilm formation.</p><p id="Par17">AI-2 is a typically quorum-sensing (QS) molecule, it can regulate physiological process of biofilm formation as the density of bacterial cells changed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The lsr protein is essential for importing and processing AI-2, which was noticed to be inhibited by high concentration of Glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We speculated that biofilm formation preferred to consume glycerol to biosynthesize G-3-P as it could regulate the expression of AI-2 to avoid biofilm dispersal. This was agreeable with our result that the level of glycerol during biofilm formation was decreased remarkably while the production of G-3-P was enhanced substantially (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Moreover, the most carbohydrates were incorporated into FimH adhesion (mannose) to increase the adhesive capability of biofilm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or participate in the EPS formation. So bacteria would seek other nutrients to maintain their survival. The G-3-P was the key precursor of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, it was a key factor that connected the carbohydrate metabolism to glycerolipid metabolism, as well as was a candidate for providing the microbes with the necessary energy. Thus, our finding convinced that more G-3-P has been synthesized, via consuming more glycerol to maintain the survival of bacterial cells during biofilm formation.</p><p id="Par18">Interestingly, our data showed that putrescine was expressed differentially between two modes of UTI89. This result was well supported by previous studies that putrescine plays a crucial role in modulating the biofilm formation triggered by some bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Another polyamine spermidine was observed to have a remarkable shift in biofilm formation, which was not expected since spermidine was verified only to inhibit the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> at PH 7, but not link to the biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In near future, we shall figure out to study further the mechanisms of this metabolite modulating biofilm formation.</p><p id="Par19">Bacterial cells in biofilm mode have extraordinary survival ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> to resist the environmental stress largely via the protective EPS. Amino acid metabolism, carbohydras metabolism and glycolipid metabolism in bacteria were not only responsible for the biosynthesis and storage of accessible energy but also were utilized for synthesizing the secreted components such as amino acids, sugars, lipids, uridines and organic acids, which are essential for EPS production during biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Those metabolic pathways were highlighted in this study to have significantly metabolic reprogramming that triggered the biofilm formation from metabolic perspective (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Those findings indicated that biofilm formation is ought to yield a protective feature, by funneling metabolites into EPS synthesis, conveying the stronger protection against stress conditions via dominating the metabolic reprogramming. Biofilm network is supposed to build a anaerobic microenvironment for bacteria embedded in biofilm pellicle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, where bacterial cells were structured in a stable space. Thus, bacterial biofilm could secure more resources in order to survive well while compared to planktonic cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par20">In summary, this study was first to combine metabolomics with cytology methods together to better understand the biofilm formation in UTI89 strain.</p><p id="Par21">Our data has revealed that obviously metabolic reprogramming triggered biofilm formation while compared to planktonic population as we found lots of small-molecule metabolites are critically essential for biofilm formation and dissociation induced by UTI89. Those differential metabolites and the associated metabolic pathways can be regarded as novel targets for the development of biofilm based treatments and antibiotic discovery against the UTI89 causing infection. More importantly, such effort could provide a novel insight into better understanding of the biofilm formation caused by different bacterial strains at metabolic level.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grants (Nos 81274175 and 31670031), National Key R&amp;D Program of China (Nos 2017YFC1308600 and 2017YFC1308605), and the Startup Funding for Specialized Professorship Provided by Shanghai Jiao Tong University (No. WF220441502).</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>H.T.L. and Y.M.Q. designed and conceived the experiments; Y.M.Q., X.W., T.B.G., H.G. and H.T.L. collected and analyzed the data; H.T.L. and Y.M.Q. wrote the manuscript.
