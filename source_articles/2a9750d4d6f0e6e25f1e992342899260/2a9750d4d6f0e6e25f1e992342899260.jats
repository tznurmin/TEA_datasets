In a population of human macrophages, there are macrophages that restrict Mtb growth and those that do not. However, the sources of heterogeneity in macrophage state during Mtb infection are poorly understood. Here, we perform RNAseq on restrictive and permissive macrophages and reveal that the expression of genes involved in GM-CSF signaling discriminates between the two subpopulations. We demonstrate that blocking GM-CSF makes macrophages more permissive of Mtb growth while addition of GM-CSF increases bacterial control. In parallel, we find that the loss of bacterial control that occurs in HIV-Mtb coinfected macrophages correlates with reduced GM-CSF secretion. Treatment of coinfected cells with GM-CSF restores bacterial control. Thus, we leverage the natural variation in macrophage control of Mtb to identify a critical cytokine response for regulating Mtb survival and identify components of the antimicrobial response induced by GM-CSF.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">GM-CSF has been implicated <italic>in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) host control.

Mtb is estimated to infect nearly a third of the global population but only causes overt disease in a subset of individuals. The natural variability in Mtb infection outcomes reflects the inherent capacity of the human immune response to control Mtb infection but also the fact that this immune control is clearly imperfect. To date, we have a limited understanding of the mechanistic basis of successful control or why this control sometimes fails in otherwise immunocompetent people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Macrophages are central mediators of the immune response to Mtb infection. They are one of the primary cell types infected with Mtb, and integrate a variety of immune signals to coordinate the response to infection. The best described pathway by which human macrophages can be activated to limit Mtb growth is through the vitamin D-dependent induction of antimicrobial peptides, cathelicidin and β-defensin 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The canonical activator, IFN-γ, which is strongly antimicrobial in murine macrophages through induction of nitric oxide production, drives human macrophages to kill Mtb through the activation of this vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It is unclear whether this pathway is the exclusive mechanism of Mtb killing by human macrophages or whether alternative pathways are available to some or all macrophage populations.</p><p id="Par5">Since the 1960s it has been recognized that macrophages can be activated in response to different stimuli to generate different functional states. In the canonical paradigm, macrophages are polarized via different cytokine combinations into M1 or M2a/b/c states. M1 cells are characterized, broadly speaking, by microbicidal activity and M2 cells by a suite of immunoregulatory functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In the setting of Mtb infection, previously published studies have demonstrated that M1 macrophages are more restrictive of bacterial growth than M2 macrophages. While macrophage state is often simplified as a terminal differentiation state, dictated by the stimulus provided, emerging data supports a more nuanced model in which there is plasticity in cellular states and functional differences in the responses of apparently homogeneous myeloid cells exposed to the same stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">We developed a single cell model of Mtb killing by primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). In our system, macrophages are matured in human serum without exogenous cytokine stimulation resulting in macrophages whose surface marker expression is similar that that of macrophages generated using M-CSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Using a bacterial live-dead reporter strain to assess macrophage antimicrobial capacity at a single cell level, we find that these macrophages display significant cell-to-cell variability in antibacterial capacity. We leveraged this natural variation in antimicrobial function to define the features of the antimicrobial pathways engaged in macrophages that naturally kill the infecting bacteria. Through global transcriptional profiling and transcriptional pathway analysis of isolated macrophage subpopulations, we find that differential expression of genes implicated in the GM-CSF signaling pathway most strongly discriminates macrophages that have successfully controlled Mtb (restrictive macrophages) from macrophages that permit bacterial survival (permissive macrophages) and that addition of exogenous GM-CSF further increases bacterial killing. GM-CSF mediated bacterial killing correlates with increased phagolysosomal maturation but not increased CAMP expression or reactive nitrogen species production, suggesting that it activates a different antimicrobial pathway than that activated by vitamin D and IFN-γ. Finally, we show that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection makes macrophages more permissive of Mtb growth, which correlates with reduced GM-CSF production, and that treatment with GM-CSF, but not other canonical activators such as vitamin D or IFN-γ, restores bacterial killing by HIV-TB coinfected cells. Taken together, these data define a pathway to bacterial control in human macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Macrophage control of Mtb infection is heterogeneous</title><p id="Par7">In primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) the total Mtb burden increases slowly over time, which has historically been interpreted as evidence that in the absence of sufficient activation of the vitamin D pathway, primary human MDMs slow Mtb growth but cannot kill the bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, more recent studies suggest that the slow increase in Mtb burden measured at a population level instead represents the integrated effects of simultaneous bacterial growth and killing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We differentiated CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes into MDMs using human serum in the absence of additional exogenously added cytokines that would strongly skew the population. We compared the surface expression of CD36, HLA-DR, CD163, CD32, CD86, CD274, and CD206 between human-serum differentiated macrophages and macrophages matured with M-CSF. We observed that compared to an isotype-control, both M-CSF and human-serum derived macrophages expressed all of these markers with the exception of CD163 although there were slightly different levels in surface expression of these markers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Primary monocyte-derived macrophages have variable capacity to restrict Mtb. <bold>a</bold> Representative flow cytometry plot of surface expression of CD163, CD32, CD36, HLA-DR, CD274, CD206, CD86, CD64 on human serum or M-CSF-derived macrophages <bold>b</bold> Plasmid design for transcriptional live-dead reporter. <bold>c</bold> Quantification of bacterial viability (GFP + area/RFP + area) in macrophages stimulated with DMSO or imatinib.

To do this, we utilized an H37Rv reporter strain carrying a live-dead plasmid that we and others have previously shown enables measurement of bacterial fate with single cell resolution using high density microscopy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Briefly, in this strain a long-lived red fluorescent protein (E2-Crimson or mCherry) is constitutively expressed under the control of the GroEL promoter, marking the presence of all bacteria. To assess bacterial viability, green fluorescent protein (GFP) is expressed under the control of the tetracycline (Tet) inducible promoter. Bacteria that respond to inducer and express GFP are considered transcriptionally active, which we use as a proxy for viability (live bacteria). We validated the reporter as a metric for host mediated clearance by treating macrophages with imatinib, a well-described host directed therapy for tuberculosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Imatinib treatment led to a decline in viable bacteria as assessed by the reporter and consistent with the measured change in CFU (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). We also assessed the relative stability of the signal of the red fluorescent protein in our system over time to identify clearance of dead bacteria that might lead us to significantly underestimate bacterial killing with the reporter system as certain antibiotics can rapidly diminish all fluorescent protein signal by disrupting the bacterial cell wall. Tracking the red signal over time revealed that there was no precipitous loss of RFP signal on a per cell basis over the first five days after imatinib treatment. Finally, we defined infection conditions under which Mtb infection did not lead to significant death as loss of cells would impact our ability to interpret bacterial survival dynamics. We used two strategies to measure macrophage viability, following both LDH release over time and the total number of nuclei per well. When macrophages are infected at a multiplicity of infection of one, we did not detect a reduction in the total number of nuclei per well or an increase in the release of LDH although we were able to detect enhanced LDH release using nigericin, a potent activator of pyroptosis that is known to drive LDH release (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Using this system, we tracked Mtb survival in macrophages over time at a single cell level. Prior to infection and at early time points post infection, the population of Mtb bacteria is almost entirely viable. However, over time an increasing fraction of the macrophages appear to have fully killed the infecting bacteria while others continue to harbor fully viable Mtb (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). In addition, some macrophages contain a mixture of transcriptionally active and silent bacteria, perhaps reflecting the temporal dynamics inherent in the system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>RNAseq reveals distinct macrophage programs during infection</title><p id="Par10">We sought to identify molecular differences underlying this heterogeneity in macrophage functional capacity, isolating functionally distinct macrophage populations by flow cytometry where we sorted based on the state of the bacterial transcriptional reporter. Briefly, macrophages were infected with the reporter Mtb strain MOI of 0.5, and then infection was allowed to proceed for 4 days. Anhydrotetracycline was added at day 4 to induce the live-dead reporter prior to sorting. Uninfected macrophages were used to establish gates for RFP<sup>−</sup>/GFP<sup>−</sup>.

In our system, macrophages are matured via adherence in the absence of exogenously added cytokines. To assess the function of GM-CSF in the setting of Mtb infection, we first measured the secretion of GM-CSF in response to Mtb infection. Cells infected with Mtb but not uninfected macrophages secrete low but measurable quantities of GM-CSF as measured by ELISA by 24 h post-infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). Neutralization of endogenous GM-CSF reduces macrophage killing of Mtb as compared to treatment with an isotype control antibody (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>). Moreover, addition of exogenous GM-CSF increased the capacity of the macrophage population to kill Mtb as demonstrated by the live-dead reporter assay and by measuring colony-forming units (CFU) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). These data demonstrate that human macrophages produce GM-CSF in response to infection, which enhances the antimicrobial activity of at least some macrophages in the population. We note that GM-CSF did not enhance Mtb control in every macrophage suggesting that the quality of the GM-CSF response within the macrophage population was not equivalent between all cells, although we could not find evidence for differences in the expression of the GM-CSF receptor of GM-CSF itself in restrictive and permissive cells to explain these differences (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>GM-CSF enhances antimicrobial programs</title><p id="Par13">We next sought to define the pathways underlying GM-CSF-driven Mtb control in MDMs. We began by testing well-established mechanisms that mediate bacterial control, production of reactive nitrogen species and production of antimicrobial peptides. Nitric oxide is a key antimicrobial effector and well-recognized feature of classically defined M1 murine macrophages; however, production of reactive nitrogen species by human macrophages has been difficult to detect, and recent data suggests that observed increases in reactive nitrogen species are of bacterial origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, given the literature describing nitric oxide as an antimicrobial mediator, we sought to assess the production of nitric oxide in our system. In the bulk using a Griess assay, we found no detectable increase in production of nitrite with GM-CSF consistent with an NO-independent mechanism (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). We were also unable to detect NOS<sub>2</sub> by immunofluorescence or any evidence of NOS<sub>2</sub> expression in our sorted populations of macrophages with or without GM-CSF treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Alternative pathways implicated in human macrophage control of Mtb include the production of antimicrobial peptides in the setting of IFN-γ and Vitamin D exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. We tested whether GM-CSF induced the expression of cathelicidin during Mtb infection as a mechanism for Mtb control using quantitative RT-PCR.

To assess the effects of GM-CSF on phagolysosomal fusion, we stained unstimulated or GM-CSF stimulated Mtb-infected macrophages with the pH-sensitive dye Lysotracker red and imaged these cells using confocal microscopy. GM-CSF stimulation enhanced Mtb localization in acidic compartments consistent with previous observations in mice suggesting neutralization of GM-CSF in vivo diminishes phagolysosomal fusion and enhances bacterial survival (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>). This suggests that GM-CSF may act to either enhance trafficking of Mtb to the lysosome or enhancing an alternative antimicrobial response, which then subsequently results in trafficking of Mtb to the phagolysosome.</p><p id="Par15">In parallel with these directed strategies to explore the relationship between GM-CSF stimulation and known antimicrobial programs, we attempted to an agnostically understand the mechanisms of GM-CSF mediated control. We were unable to take a genetic approach because, in our hands, human macrophage cell lines are not capable of robust Mtb killing and nucleofection of MDMs followed by Mtb infection lead to extensive cell death. Therefore, we used a panel of small molecule inhibitors to target specific aspects of the response to infection in MDMs. Macrophages were infected with the live-dead Mtb reporter strain, treated with inhibitor and then treated with exogenous GM-CSF. Bacterial survival was quantitated four days post infection by high-density microscopy. Because our endpoint was bacterial survival, we focused on small molecules that did not cause significant macrophage death over the course of the assay.</p><p id="Par16">We calculated a killing index by calculating the bacterial viability measured after treatment with the small molecules and the bacterial viability after treatment with a vehicle control. The killing index is a ratio of the viability in the small molecule treated condition relative to the vehicle control. Most of the small molecules had either no effect on or enhanced bacterial killing by our live-dead reporter. However, glibenclamide, an NLRP3 inhibitor attenuated the ability of GM-CSF to activate human macrophages to kill Mtb consistently across multiple donors (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d, e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To control for off-target effects of glibenclamide, we also tested the effect of glipizide, a structurally similar drug which does not inhibit NLRP3, and found that it had no effect on GM-CSF driven bacterial control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. NLRP3 inhibition has been associated with diminished IL-1β secretion, so we next sought to measure IL-1β in the setting of glibenclamide and GM-CSF. Upon GM-CSF stimulation, we found a modest increase in IL-1β secretion, and consistent with a model for NLRP3-mediated IL-1β secretion, we found that glibenclamide treatment reversed IL-1β secretion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g, h</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4d</xref>). IL-1β secretion is often associated with LDH release and pyroptosis; however, in our system, GM-CSF treatment activates bacterial killing as measured at a single cell level via microscopy in intact macrophages, suggesting that pyroptosis was not artificially leading to a decrease in Mtb numbers. Consistent with this observation, measurement of LDH release as an indicator of cell death did not reveal differences between LDH release by Mtb infected macrophages treated with GM-CSF and untreated macrophages despite differences in IL-1β secretion; however, increased LDH release was seen with nigericin, an alternative driver of IL-1β secretion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4e</xref>). Neutralization of IL-1β had no impact on bacterial killing suggesting that IL-1β may serve as an environmental inflammatory cue as opposed to a mechanism to enhance cell-intrinsic bacterial control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3j</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>HIV co-infection disrupts GM-CSF secretion and Mtb control</title><p id="Par17">We focused on the pathways underlying natural variation in macrophages’ antimicrobial capacity because we postulated that these might be highly vulnerable to modulation. In parallel studies, we sought understand the effects of HIV on macrophage control of Mtb infection and surprisingly these studies also converged on the importance of GM-CSF in driving macrophage control of Mtb. Like Mtb, HIV has the capacity to infect macrophages and we and others have postulated that the potential interactions between Mtb and HIV may contribute to the accelerated TB disease observed in HIV-infected individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. To test this model, we developed an in vitro model of coinfection using human MDMs infected with the virulent HIV strain HIV-bal. Our single cell reporter assay is of particular value in this experimental setting where HIV and Mtb both infect subpopulations of macrophages with considerable donor-to-donor variation. A single-cell assay where we can specifically assess Mtb-infected or Mtb/HIV-coinfected cells allows us to detect more subtle differences where the bulk of the population of cells may not be infected with either the bacterium or virus. HIV was permitted to replicate over two weeks after which cells were infected with Mtb. Infection with HIV resulted in a notable increase in surface expression of CD36 and CD32 however there were not consistent changes in the expression of other surface markers across all donors when comparing sham to HIV infected cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Macrophage uptake of bacteria was not influenced by HIV infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

Cells were then incubated with (500 ng/ml) of DAPI in 0.1% Igepal for 10 min and washed twice with 1× PBS. Anti-p24 monoclonal antibody (Thermo Scientific, MA1–7040) was conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s instructions and purified by column chromatography (GE Healthcare) followed by desalting columns (Thermo Scientific). MDM were stained with 0.1 μg/ml monoclonal antibody for 1 hour, washed with 1× PBS three times and coated with 50% glycerol + n-propyl gallate (5 mg/ml) for imaging.</p><p id="Par31">To visualize iNOS expression in Mtb-infected macrophages, macrophages were fixed for 2 h with 2% PFA at room temperature (RT). After fixation, the samples were blocked in 0.3% Triton-X 100/5 % donkey serum serum/1X PBS for 60 min at RT, washed, and incubated with anti-NOS2 (Cell Signaling Technology Clone D6B6; 1:100) overnight at 4 °C. The samples were washed again and stained with an Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher; 1:1000, A-31573) for 1 h at RT. Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal Microscope fitted with a 20X objective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Imaging and analysis</title><p id="Par32">MDM cells and the resident HIV and Mtb were imaged using a DeltaVision fluorescence microscope (GE Healthcare) with Z-stack of 0.5 slice thickness over 15 µm. Individual cells were demarked using a brightfield image taken at the midpoint of the Z-stack. Fluorescence Z-stack images were averaged for each light channel. To accurately detect and measure Mtb signal, cell background per macrophage was measured in ImageJ for both the 580 (mCherry) and 525 (GFP) wavelengths. Pixel intensities 4 standard deviations above the average cell background signal in the 580 channel was considered positive signal for Mtb mCherry (constitutive signal), while pixel intensities with values above 2 standard deviations the average cell background in the 525 channel were scored as positive for Mtb GFP signal (transcriptional induction). Only pixels positive for Mtb mCherry signal were measured for GFP signal. The transcriptional activity of Mtb per macrophage was quantified by dividing the total intracellular pixels scored positive for mCherry signal by the total number of pixels scored positive for GFP signal in the same macrophage. Fluorescence intensity in the 647 channel was also measured for individual macrophages in cultures infected and not infected with HIV. Intensity value per cell was divided by total cell area. A macrophage was scored positive for active HIV replication when 647 signal was greater than 2.5 standard deviations above the average signal for macrophages not exposed to HIV.</p><p id="Par33">Small molecule inhibitor effects on bacterial viability were analyzed by high-throughput high-density microscopy. The cells were washed, fixed, and stained with DAPI. Images were obtained via Operetta High-Content Imaging Fluorescence Microscope (Perkin-Elmer) outfitted with 20 × NA objective. Total Mtb bacterial burden was determined based on mCherry + pixels. Transcriptionally active Mtb bacterial burden was determined based on GFP + pixels. Between 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> and 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per condition over technical triplicates per donor were analyzed using Columbus (Perkin-Elmer). Bacterial survival was calculated as a ratio of live to total bacteria (the number of GFP + pixels (live) divided by the number of mCherry + pixels (total burden). Experimental conditions where the number of nuclei decreased dramatically relative to a vehicle control were excluded from subsequent analyses.</p><p id="Par34">For co-localization of Mtb in lysosomes, GM-CSF (5 ng/mL) was added to MDM infected with GFP-expressing Mtb as described above for 24 hr at 37 °C. Lysotracker Red DND-99 (1 mM; Thermo Fisher) was added to samples for 1 hr at 37 °C prior to washing and fixation. Macrophage nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma; 500 ng/mL) in 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) for 10 min at RT, and the cells were washed. Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal Microscope fitted with a 20× objective. Between 200 and 600 macrophages per condition over technical duplicates per donor (total three) were analyzed using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Colony forming units</title><p id="Par35">Mtb-infected macrophages were lysed with 1× PBS + 0.05% Triton x-100 for 5 min to release intracellular Mtb.

The sensitivity of the kit ranged from 0.0005 to 0.2 ng/ml depending on the analyte measured. Undiluted cell culture supernatant samples were harvested from macrophage cultures at various times in the experiment and stored at −80 °C. Supernatants were thawed and filtered twice, to remove Mtb, by centrifugation using 0.2 µm Bio-Inert AcroPrep 96 well plates (Pall Life Sciences) prior to cytokine measurements. Data were collected using a Bio-Plex Suspension Array Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) and BIO-plex manager software (version 4). HIV-p24 ELISA was performed using thawed macrophage culture supernatants that had been collected and stored at −80 °C, per the manufacture’s instructions (PerkinElmer). GM-CSF ELISA was also performed on culture supernatants per the manufacture’s instructions (Biolegend).
