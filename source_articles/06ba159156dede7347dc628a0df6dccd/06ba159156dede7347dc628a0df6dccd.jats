sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of highly conserved proteins which expression responds to environmental stressors, such as high temperature, ultraviolet light, inflammation, infection and cellular toxins. HSPs are usually named according to their molecular weights; small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) have a molecular mass of 18–40 kDa while major HSPs have a variety of molecular masses, including HSP60, HSP70, HSP90 and HSP100<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. HSPs play essential roles in organisms, particularly in terms of protection against a variety of stressors. Heat stress can disturb cellular homeostasis in all organisms, potentially resulting in death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, to mitigate such stress, metabolic profiles often undergo changes so that metabolic homeostasis can be re-established rapidly and effectively; for example, in order to repair cellular damage. Previous research has shown that HSP proteins play a key role in these metabolic changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The HSP70 family is a group of stress response proteins that has been studied extensively in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The number of HSP70 family members expressed is species-dependent. The human HSP70 family features 13 genes that differ from each other in terms of expression level, subcellular location and amino acid constitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, in general, the HSP70 family can be divided into four groups. The first group is HSP70, which is either not or moderately expressed, under normal conditions. However, the expression of HSP70 can be rapidly induced when cells are exposed to heat, cold or other stressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The second group is HSC70, which is expressed constitutively in most human tissues. In humans, HSC70 exhibits 86% identity to HSP70<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. According to previous reports, the expression of HSC70 can also be induced by heat stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, but again that can be species-dependent. The third group is glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), which is also known as immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BIP) or heat shock 70 kDa cognate 3. GRP78 is an important endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone that is localised to the ER and plays essential roles in the unfolded protein response (UPR), oxidative stress, ER calcium binding and the activation of transmembrane ER stress sensors. GRP78 can be induced by stressors such as salinity, pH and excessive exposure to metal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The fourth group is glucose-regulated protein 76 (GRP75) which is predominantly expressed in the mitochondria and is not induced in response to stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Thus far, only one gene of the HSP70 family, namely HSP70 has been described in <italic>Artemia franciscana</italic> Kellogg, 1906 (accession number: AF427596). Acknowledging that in all eukaryotes this family has multiple members, it is of particular interest to investigate this family of genes in stress tolerant organism as <italic>Artemia</italic>. In this study, novel members of the HSP70 family were identified from a draft <italic>Artemia</italic> genome database (fully annotated but unpublished yet) using bioinformatic tools. Orthology prediction methods analysed the complete open reading frame (ORF) for each gene identified. Gene sequences were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Next, we investigated the expression of the identified HSP70 members in two populations of <italic>Artemia</italic>: a control population (CF12) that experienced 12 generations of isothermal laboratory culture conditions and a selected population (TF12) featuring the survivors of over 12 generations of an induced thermotolerance treatment. In addition, the expression of the newly identified HSP70 members was also examined following non-lethal heat shock (NLHS) in both CF12 and TF12 populations. Our results showed that members of the HSP70 family respond differentially at the transcriptional level to “thermal” selection or to NLHS, or to both.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sequence identification and phylogenetic analysis of genes from the HSP70 family</title><p id="Par5">To identify HSP70 family members in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>franciscana</italic>, we used reference HSP70 genes from closely related species (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>) to search an <italic>Artemia</italic> transcriptomic database. Partial cDNA sequences of HSP70 genes were then confirmed by PCR amplification using juvenile <italic>Artemia</italic> (SFB, ARC1768) and DNA sequencing.

This sequence contains a typical ATP-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain of the HSP70 family (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The deduced amino acid sequence of <italic>HSC70</italic> includes the three signature sequences of genes from the HSP70 family including IDLGTTYS (residues 9–16), LIFDLGGGTFDVSIL (residues 196–210) and IVLVGGSTRIPKVQK (residues 334–348), as predicted by ExPASy software. Moreover, a series of unique repeat GG[X]P motifs, and a cytosolic Hsp70–specific motif, EEVD (residues 647–650), were found at the C-terminus of HSC70 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). The protein has a molecular mass of 70.89 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 5.38, as predicted by ExPASy tools. A phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the complete HSC70 ORFs.

In a previous study, the alignment of 45 kB DNA sequences from 62 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes from 75 arthropod species generated a family tree of arthropods in which the Branchiopoda cluster together with Multicrustacea (Copepod, Malacostraca and Thecostraca) in a clade named Vericrustacea (Copepod, Malacostraca, Thecostraca and Branchiopoda)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

This observation is supported by several recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Previous research described by Oakley <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) and Eyun (2017) is based on the use of new transcriptomes and a new morphological matrix (including fossils), but also includes existing data relating to expressed sequence tags, the mitochondrial genome, the nuclear genome, ribosomal DNA data and 24 nuclear protein-coding genes; by combining such data, these authors aimed to generate new insights into Pancrustacean phylogeny. Their results revealed that Branchiopoda belong to the clade Allotriocaride, as is the case of Hexapoda, thus explaining why some crustacean genes are closely related to insect genes Hexapoda. However, according to several phylogenetic analyses involving Arthropods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we found that the differential classification results for Branchiopoda (<italic>Artemia</italic>), and other classes within the Arthropoda phylum, were dependent upon clusters of input data.

Other research, involving thermal acclimation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, demonstrated the up-regulation of transcriptional activity, and a change in the abundance of HSP70 protein, in flies acclimated to 31 °C (heat acclimation) as compared with flies acclimated at 25 °C. Furthermore, a significantly higher survival rate (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) was evident in heat-acclimated flies, suggesting that HSP70 plays a more important role in the acquisition of thermotolerance during acclimation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Collectively, existing literature, and our current data suggest that HSP70 family members located in the cytosol (HSP70), mitochondria (HSC70-5) and ER (BIP) are heat shock inducible.</p><p id="Par20">In the TF12 population, obtained after 12 generations of selective breeding for induced thermotolerance, we observed significantly higher expression of <italic>HSP70</italic> and <italic>HSC70</italic> relative to the control population (CF12). This result is related to selective breeding for induced thermotolerance in sunflowers, in which thermo-tolerant lines show enhanced expression of heat shock proteins; the expression of HSP18.1, HSP90 and HSP104 were all induced upon heat-induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, the current study reports, for the first time, the expression pattern profile of genes from the HSP70 family during a selective breeding program for induced thermotolerance. Our data demonstrated indicating that these two genes might play important roles in thermotolerance in <italic>Artemia</italic>. Moreover, our results showed that selection can influence the response to NLHS response; selection for induced thermotolerance caused a significant increase (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the expression of <italic>HSP70</italic>, <italic>HSC70</italic> and <italic>HSC70-5</italic> in TF12 after NLHS. On the other hand, HYOU1 and HSPA4 did not show significant up-regulation after NLHS, for both CF12 and TF12 populations. This result might imply that selective breeding for induced thermotolerance could induce the expression of only some HSP70 family members and that these genes were associated with thermotolerance in <italic>Artemia</italic>.</p><p id="Par21">Furthermore, some reports have demonstrated the function of <italic>HSP70</italic>, <italic>HSC70</italic>, and <italic>HSC70-5</italic> in thermotolerance and immune defenses by using RNA interference (RNAi) technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.
