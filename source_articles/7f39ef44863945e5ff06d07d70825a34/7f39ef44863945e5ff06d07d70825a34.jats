This enables the synchronization of large bacterial group activities such as pigment production, biofilm formation, swarming motility, toxin production and exozyme secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Depending upon the type of autoinducers, quorum sensing can be categorized into three. Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) mediated quorum sensing which is exhibited exclusively by gram negative bacteria, peptide mediated signalling which is observed in gram positive bacteria and LuxS controlled autoinducer-2 intervened communication, which is seen in both gram negative and gram positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To be precise quorum sensing is the summation of synthesis, release, identification and responding to autoinducers. Bacteria exploit the highly specific nature of signalling molecules when they are in an endosymbiotic locale, due to which communication among one species will be intact from signalling molecules of other spices, hence no cross talking between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Such extreme specificity is achieved by peculiar signal- receptor binding sites that recognize only specific signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In gram negative bacteria a vast diversity of LuxI/LuxR homologues genes are studied for its quorum sensing regulation, such as LuxI/LuxR in <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> regulating the bioluminance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; SmaI/SmaR controlled production of carbapenem, prodigiosin, pectate lyase and cellulase in <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; LasI/LasR and RhiI/RhiR mediated virulence factors synthesis by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The studies on quorum sensing architecture suggest that it is possible to inhibit quorum sensing mediated bacterial virulence by suppressing bacterial communication.</p><p id="Par5">Quorum sensing can be inhibited by various methods which is collectively called as quorum quenching wherein, the signalling mechanism is repressed without effecting the bacterial growth. Due to this the virulent properties of pathogens are suppressed, as a result host defence mechanism gets adequate exposure and time for effective bacterial clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Quorum quenching protocols can be broadly classified into two groups such as enzymatic inhibition and non-enzymatic inhibition. Enzymatic inhibition includes the degradation of signalling molecule by the usage of enzymes like lactonase, acylase, oxidoreductase etc.<italic>,</italic>which will consecutively disable the signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Non-enzymatic bacterial silencing can be attained by approaches like signal synthesis inhibition, competitive or allosteric inhibition of signal binding to response gene and through blocking signal reception by response gene through modification and conformational changes of signalling molecule structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Despite numerous beneficial characteristics of bacteria, the infections caused by them are crafting new life threatening medical conditions. There have been several approaches used for the annihilation of bacterial pathogens, out of which antibiotic mediated inhibition was found to be most efficacious. The principle behind antibiotics are to inhibit essential mechanisms of bacterial existence such as cell wall synthesis, DNA replication and protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is a direct bacterial destruction mechanism where drugs target pathogens directly in which the host immune system does not have much impact on bacterial neutralization. At present the antibacterial efficiency of antibiotic drugs are under peril due to the surge of multi drug resistant strains. Various antibiotic resistant strains such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O104, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> NDM-1 were identified since the report of first antibiotic resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> in mid-nineteenth century. It is assumed that over 70% of total pathogens are resistant towards at least one of the commercially available antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To gear up the conditions vilest, discovery of new antibiotics has become limited resulting in a compulsion to implement alternative therapeutic methods to suppress multidrug resistant bacterial outbreak. In this circumstance, quorum quenching dependent bacterial attenuation can be exploited to target bacterial virulence and successive bacterial clearance.</p><p id="Par7">Several natural and synthetic products have been proclaimed for their positive quorum quenching capability, though not many of them has been adopted to therapeutic level either due to lack of extensive study or because of toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

In this study we are analysing the influence of <italic>Solanum torvum</italic> root extract upon quorum sensing regulated virulent properties of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and evaluated its potential therapeutic property upon in vivo lung infection model for efficacious bacterial clearance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample collection and extract preparation</title><p id="Par8"><italic>Solanum torvum</italic> was collected from Thrissur District, Kerala, India (Latitude: 10.5890536 and Longitude: 76.0971808).

High degree of hemorrhage and abscess was prominent in untreated group on day 7 which supports the death of two subjects of this group on subsequent day. The analysis of STRE treated group possessed inflamed lungs with hyperemia and moderate atelectasis whereas Ciprofloxacin treated group had negligible inflammation however, negative control did not show any abnormal clinical signs. Analysis of lung pathology of dead animals of positive control group on day 12 revealed predominant lung abscesses and hemorrhage due to infection. On 14th day of infection the differences between negative control, STRE treated group and Ciprofloxacin treated group was insignificant in terms of inflammation, lung atelectasis and abscesses moreover there was a significant reduction in clinical signs in group 4 on day 14 compared that with day 7.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Histopathological investigation of lungs</title><p id="Par21">Histopathological analysis of lungs was done to evaluate the tissue level changes and physiological alterations due to infection and treatment. Specimen was collected from groups 1, 3, 4 on 3rd, 7th and 14th day of infection whereas sample was taken from untreated group on day 3, 7 and 12 due to mortality of subjects. Histopathological observations made upon negative control, positive control, Ciprofloxacin treated group and STRE treated group are given in Figs.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> respectively. During all three occasions specimen collected from negative control possessed unaltered histology and intact physiology whereas no inflammation was seen. On 3rd day positive control group possessed interstitium thickening and mononuclear cell infiltration however similar response was observed in STRE treated group and Ciprofloxacin treated group. There was notable variation among the groups lately on day 7, high degree of emphysema and bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia was observed in untreated group. STRE treated group possessed inflammation, mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration, polymorpho nuclear (PMN) cells and BALT (bronchus associated lymphoid tissue) hyperplasia. However Ciprofloxacin treated group possessed slight infiltration of mononuclear cells and light inflammation. On day 14 inflammation was found reduced in STRE treated group that compared with day 7 however presence of MNC and PMN cells were detected there were no any traces of emphysema, epithelial hyperplasia or tissue hemorrhage. Tissue histology indicated successful bacterial neutralization by <italic>Solanum torvum</italic> root extracts. Examination of Ciprofloxacin treated group on day 14 revealed normal lung histology with reversed interstitium thickening and inflammation. Whereas analysis of dead subjects of untreated group revealed total obliteration of lung histology due to large amount of emphysema, epithelial hyperplasia and perivascular fibrosis leading to bronchopneumonia.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Lung histopathological observation of negative control</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40816_2019_120_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></p></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Lung histopathological observation of positive control</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40816_2019_120_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></p></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Lung histopathological observation of Ciprofloxacin treated group</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40816_2019_120_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></p></fig><fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Lung histopathological observation of STRE treated group</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40816_2019_120_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></p></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Hematological analysis of study animals</title><p id="Par22">Observations obtained in hematological examination was in correlation with histopathological interpretations.

Pseudomonas infections are mostly recurrent which shows inability of immune system to completely irradiate the possibility of successive infection. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] points out that most of the recurrent <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections in chronic lung disease occurred due to the relapse of prior infections which clearly suggest the inability of current anti-<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strategies in absolute bacterial clearance. In this juncture itâs more important to concentrate to enhance immune system against such infections rather neutralizing the infections in each occasions which can be achieved by quorum quenching mediated in vivo attenuation and successive bacterial clearance. Bacterial attenuation can be attained by manipulating bacterial quorum sensing network by inhibition of AHLâLux-R- and Lux-I-type interactions, degradation of existing AHLs, inhibition of enzymes involved in the metabolic synthesis of QS molecules, blockage of AHLâLux-R-type binding sites, inhibition of transportersÂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The effect of <italic>Solanum torvum</italic> root extracts upon bacterial virulence was analyzed by taking an account of pigment production and biofilm formation which is controlled by quorum sensing. It is been previously reported that the quorum sensing inhibition of <italic>Solanum torvum</italic> is highly influenced by factors such as bacterial density, concentration of STRE and frequency of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> pigment pyoverdin enhance the iron gathering capability of pathogen during infection competing with iron-binding protein transferrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Iron is as vital factor for microbial virulence, therefore inhibition of pyoverdin leads to iron deficiency in pathogen which in turn inhibit bacterial virulence. It is evident that <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> respiratory infections initiated by the adherence of the pathogen to the oral-pharyngeal mucosa, followed by colonization therefore inability of a pathogen will disable the persistence of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Administration of STRE decreased the production of pyoverdin in the test strain along with biofilm formation therefore it is evident that former have immense capability upon attenuating <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic> Importantly bacterial biomass was not effected by quorum sensing antagonist which suggests that reduction in virulence factors was not because of bacterial death but as a result of bacterial signaling disruption. A similar kind of observation was reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] wherein attenuation of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> by quorum sensing inhibitor furanone C-30 isolated from marine algae <italic>Delisea pulchra</italic> was investigated.</p><p id="Par25">Survival of bacterial infected rats treated by STRE confirms the ability of quorum sensing antagonist to inhibit persistent annexation of pathogens in host. Death of untreated group seen in our studies matching with previous suggestions made by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] about Pseudomonas infection in lungs cause irreversible lung damage leading to death of host if it is not treated. A significant weight loss is considered to be among the primary symptoms of untreated bacterial sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] whereas there was no there were no notable weight loss in the STRE treated group, however there was a substantial loss of weight was observed in positive control. This suggest that extract treatment is suppressing all kind of clinical complications due to infection. Fascinatingly similar observations was seen in Ciprofloxacin treated group though the antibacterial mechanism of antibiotic and STRE were diverse. Elevated bacterial concentration found in infected groups supports the mortality rate.</p><p id="Par26">Microscopic and macroscopic analysis of lung sample of study animals enlightened the immunological response. Similar kind of histopathology observed in all infected group on day 3, suggest that infection is been successful and there is immunogenicity induced. Observations on seventh day proposed various kind of immune response in different groups, high degree of emphysema and bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia seen in untreated group can be noted as initiation of lung damage. Very negligible clinical signs was observed in Ciprofloxacin treated group wherein inflammation, MNC infiltration was moderate this suggest that major portion of bacterial clearance is occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However the role of host immune system was next to nil in Ciprofloxacin treated group as antibiotic itself possess direct effect upon infection. Interestingly there was no any such action was seen in STRE treated group but host immune response was prominent with inflammation, mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration, polymorpho nuclear (PMN) cells and BALT (bronchus associated lymphoid tissue) hyperplasia. All these are natural immune response that occur in the time of a lung bacterial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] which states that STRE is not crossing over natural host immune response. At the end of treatment STRE treated group didnât show any clinical signs which indicate whole bacterial clearance like that as Ciprofloxacin treated group, though death of untreated subjects occurred due to infection. This scenario confirms that STRE does not have any direct bactericidal activity like that of Ciprofloxacin but there is successful neutralization of pathogen. It is evident that STRE is giving sufficient time to immune system wherein untreated group subjects are dead before their immune system could do anything.</p><p id="Par27">Importantly it has to be highlighted that STRE does not possess any kind of effect upon bacterial growth and biomass but the histological and hematological investigations points out that immune response found in STRE treated group was natural such as inflammation, Ig elevation and PMN infiltrationÂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].
