However, the interactions between MSCs and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are quite controversial and the underlying mechanisms are ambiguous. In this study, an investigation was conducted into the effect of human MSCs (hMSCs) on tumor proliferation and metastasis both in xenograft and orthotopic models. It was discovered that hMSCs could promote tumor growth though activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and promote metastasis by epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vivo. To test whether hMSCs could induce immunosuppressive effects, the expression of the Natural killer (NK) cell marker CD56 was measured by immunohistochemical staining and the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were measured by qRT-PCR. It was found out that CD56 expression significantly decreased, while TNF-α and IL-6 expression increased in the hMSCs-treated tissues. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing was performed, which led to a discovery that integrin α5 (ITGA5) was over-expressed in hMSCs-treated HCC. ITGA5 siRNAs blocked the hMSCs-induced migration and invasion of HCC, while over-expression of ITGA5 promoted the migration and invasion ability in HCC-hMSCs, indicating that the expression of ITGA5 is associated with hMSCs-induced tumor metastasis. These findings suggest that hMSCs may play a vital role in HCC proliferation and metastasis and could be identified as a putative therapeutic target in HCC.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41419_2019_Article_1622.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemistry, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Cell Biology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Immunology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Cell Culture</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Antibodies</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="AuthorContribution"><p>These authors contributed equally: Jiang Chen, Tong Ji, Di Wu</p></notes><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>Edited by A.

Although operation techniques, novel chemo-therapies and radio-therapies are continuously improving, the prognosis of HCC remains extremely poor. Therefore, elucidating the crucial events underlying HCC tumorigenesis and exploring new therapeutic strategies to control the tumor progression is the pivotal issue to prolong patient survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Emerging evidences indicate that hMSCs can contribute to the development of tumors, demonstrating potential clinical value in cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">MSCs are undifferentiated cells exhibiting the capacities of self-renewal and proliferation. Under certain conditions, MSCs could be induced to differentiate into a variety of mesenchymal tissues. However, the interaction between MSCs and cancer are quite ambiguous. On the one hand, some studies showed the enhanced tumor proliferation and metastasis potential induced by MSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. On the other hand, several researches indicate that MSCs could change the stromal microenvironment and suppress the metastasis of HCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Recently, several reports revealed that MSCs may play an important role in immunosuppressive effects which may contribute to cancer progression and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. It is demonstrated that MSCs could release multiple cytokines like IL6 and TNFα which exert direct effects upon cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, the application of MSCs as a carrier for tumor biological therapy ought to be verified critically.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we set out to obtain further insight into the roles played by hMSCs in HCC growth and metastasis. We tried to explain why hMSCs could influence tumor growth and metastasis by measuring the proliferation and metastasis marker protein and inflammatory associated protein in tumor tissues. We also used proliferation, migration and invasion assay to investigate the role of hMSCs by co-culture system in vitro. Finally, we performed RNA sequencing to locate the differential genes between hMSCs-treated HCC and HCC alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effects of hMSCs on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo</title><p id="Par6">MSCs are non-hematopoietic precursor cells and they also have been found in many human tissues, such as adipose tissue, bone marrow et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

To identify the effect of hMSCs on the proliferation in HCC, we first started our investigation using a subcutaneous tumor model. When Bel7404/LM3 cells (HCC group) or Bel7404/LM3 cells with hMSCs (HCC-hMSCs group) were subcutaneously inoculated, tumor sizes significantly increased in HCC-hMSCs group as compared to control group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>), suggesting that hMSCs promote the tumor growth in vivo. However, it was demonstrated that Huh7/Hep3B cells with hMSCs could not promote tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a, b</xref>). Next, to interrogate the role of hMSCs in tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic model, we used Bel7404/LM3 model in situ tumor formation and found tumors turned much larger when injected HCC cells with hMSCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1c, d</xref>).
