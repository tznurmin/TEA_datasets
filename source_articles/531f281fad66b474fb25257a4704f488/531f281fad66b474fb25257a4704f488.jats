We imputed BovineHD genotypes to whole genome sequence for 2703 Holsteins that were cases or controls for Bovine Respiratory Disease and sampled from either California or New Mexico to construct and compare genomic prediction models. The sequence variation reference dataset comprised variants called for 1578 animals from Run 5 of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project, including 450 Holsteins and 29 animals sequenced from this study population. Genotypes for 9,282,726 variants with minor allele frequencies ≥5% were imputed and used to obtain genomic predictions in GEMMA using a Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Variation explained by markers increased from 13.6% using BovineHD data to 14.4% using imputed whole genome sequence data and the resolution of genomic regions detected as harbouring QTL substantially increased. Explained variation in the analysis of the combined California and New Mexico data was less than when data for each state were separately analysed and the estimated genetic correlation between risk of Bovine Respiratory Disease in California and New Mexico Holsteins was − 0.36. Consequently, genomic predictions trained using the data from one state did not accurately predict disease risk in the other state. To determine if a prediction model could be developed with utility in both states, we selected variants within genomic regions harbouring: 1) genes involved in the normal immune response to infection by pathogens responsible for Bovine Respiratory Disease detected by RNA-Seq analysis, and/or 2) QTL identified in the association analysis of the imputed sequence variants. The model based on QTL selected variants is biased but when trained in one state generated BRD risk predictions with positive accuracies in the other state.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">We demonstrate the utility of sequence-based and biology-driven model development for genomic selection. Disease phenotypes cannot be routinely recorded in most livestock species and the observed phenotypes may vary in their genomic architecture due to variation in the pathogen composition across environments. Elucidation of trait biology and genetic architecture may guide the development of prediction models with utility across breeds and environments.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Economic cost</title><p id="Par18">Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) impacts the U.S. cattle population more than any other communicable disease. In a recent study, the estimated economic cost of a BRD case was $253.97 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Management tools to limit the impacts of BRD are limited due to the broad array of responsible pathogens and the lack of effective vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, diagnosis of the pathogens responsible for disease in affected animals is uncommon and has prevented the development of predictions of genetic merit for disease risk and their incorporation into selection indexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Previous study</title><p id="Par19">To develop genetic resources for the improvement of resistance to BRD, a case-control study was performed in 2703 Holstein calves from New Mexico (NM) or California (CA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Phenotypes were collected using the McGuirk scoring system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and animals were genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD (HD) assay to characterize the genetic architecture of resistance to the underlying pathogens responsible for disease and to identify large-effect QTL. Disease traits such as BRD are difficult to develop prediction models for the implementation of Genomic Selection due to the lack of phenotype data. Consequently, the greatest opportunity for the development of genomic predictions (GP) for risk of BRD industry-wide is to leverage developed resource populations to generate GP with utility across environments and potentially also across breeds.</p><p id="Par20">An important observation made in the initial study was that there appeared to be substantial genetic heterogeneity between environments for risk of BRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While moderate estimates of percent variation explained (PVE) on the observed scale (21–22%) for risk of BRD were obtained in the analyses performed within each state, when the data for the two states were combined, the PVE estimate substantially decreased (~ 14%). This was interpreted to be a consequence of genetic heterogeneity in the immune response due to the presence of different pathogen profiles present within each environment as established from pathogen diagnostic analyses of deep nasopharyngeal and mid-nasal swabs taken from each sampled animal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Goals of this study</title><p id="Par21">QTL mapping and GP for risk of BRD require approaches that differ from the neutral marker paradigm that has successfully been applied to routinely recorded livestock production traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Genetic heterogeneity between populations occurs when sick animals display the same clinical signs, but these signs are caused by infections involving different pathogens that elicit potentially different immune responses. When this occurs, mutations in different genes and regulatory elements may lead to susceptibility to different pathogens which also differ in their prevalence across environments, leading to an apparent genotype-by-environment interaction for risk of BRD. When this is the case, the genetic correlation between risk of BRD in the different environments will be substantially less than one and integrating data for animals from different environments will result in the identification of QTL or production of GP that have a reduced pathogen specificity. This approach will therefore tend to reduce the ability to identify variants with pathogen-specific effects on risk of BRD. Considering the cost and difficulty of creating GP training populations representing the range of U.S. cattle production environments, it is imperative that we fully leverage existing disease status data. We attempted to utilize different data types to enhance our biological understanding of BRD and better understand the genetic architecture of disease risk within and across regions.</p><p id="Par22">We utilized two strategies in an attempt to improve the utility of GPs across geographic regions of the U.S. using the data reported in Neibergs et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The first approach involved the imputation of the HD genotype data to the level of whole genome sequence (WGS) variation using a large reference panel of sequenced individuals from Run 5 of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project (1KBGP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the second approach, we examined the effects of reducing the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the WGS imputation set that were included in the GP model to sets selected based upon a genome-wide association (GWAS) analysis of these data and a previous RNA-Seq analysis. We included SNPs located within genomic regions found to harbour QTL of large effect on risk of BRD, or SNPs located within genomic regions previously found to harbour genes involved in the normal immune response to infection by pathogens responsible for BRD based on RNA-Seq analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and the union of these two sets of variants. Recent studies have suggested the utility of incorporating ancillary information into the analysis to inform the selection of biologically relevant loci and reduce the challenge of estimating effects for several hundreds of thousands, or millions, of loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">When the genetic architecture of a trait varies across environments, we postulate that improved predictions could be produced by enriching the prediction model for SNPs that tag segregating disease risk QTL detected in multiple environments or variants associated with immune response loci. The first approach uses a two-step data analysis in which the first phase estimates WGS variant effects and the second, feature selection step, retains only those SNPs that are located in large-effect QTL regions for the prediction of genetic merit. We recognise that this does not represent the use of independent data to identify QTL and that the estimated QTL effects are positively biased, which is commonly known as the “Beavis effect” (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] for an explanation). Consequently, the selection of SNPs in QTL regions detected in an analysis of the same data set is likely to result in a positive bias in the accuracy of GPs. We sought to quantify the magnitude of this bias by performing cross-validation analyses in which subsets of the data were used for QTL detection and the training of the prediction model which was then applied to an independent subset of the data for validation of prediction accuracy. The second approach utilized completely independent biological information to identify genomic regions harbouring genes involved in the normal immune response to infection by pathogens causing BRD and then selecting SNPs from the WGS variants located in these regions for the prediction of genetic merit.</p><p id="Par24">Our objectives were to examine the utility of these analytical frameworks for developing a single GP model for risk of BRD across geographic regions of the U.S. and for improving our biological understanding of the mechanisms of disease resistance in livestock via more precise QTL mapping using WGS imputed variants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Imputation</title><p id="Par25">Imputation resulted in 39,721,988 SNPs with genotypes predicted in the 2703 animals. To estimate the accuracy of imputation, we performed a separate imputation analysis using only the 1KBGP Run 5 reference set. Here, we excluded the genotype data for the 29 Holsteins sequenced from among our BRD study animals from the WGS reference set and produced a direct measure of imputation accuracy as the Pearson correlation between their WGS imputed and WGS called genotypes. Overall mean per SNP genotype imputation accuracy was 76%. However, we observed regions throughout the genome where genotype imputation accuracy was very low (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The boundaries for these regions were estimated using a spline fitting analysis of imputation accuracy correlations in 10-kb windows throughout the genome using GenWin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Imputed variants were then filtered either on the basis of their individual SNP imputation accuracy or regional accuracy using the regions of low (&lt; 65%) average imputation accuracy identified by GenWin. We also filtered all variants with a minor allele frequency &lt; 5%. This resulted in a set of 9,282,726 imputed variants for the 2703 animals for which the average imputation accuracy was estimated to be 84.2%.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A window-based analysis of SNP genotype imputation accuracy performed with Genwin for chromosome 23.

The estimates of PVE improved and mapping signals refined the locations of detected QTL. PVE estimates within each state increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, the decrease in the estimate of PVE remained when the CA and NM cohorts were combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and when the case-control data for the two states were analysed as separate traits in a bivariate model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] implemented in GCTA, the genetic correlation between risk of BRD in CA Holsteins and NM Holsteins was estimated to be − 0.36. Imputed variants with strong association signals were found both within QTL regions previously detected in the analyses of the HD data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and in novel regions that were only detected in the analysis of the imputed WGS variants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Genes such as <italic>CSMD1</italic>, which regulates the complement system controlling inflammatory responses are now implicated as candidates for variation in risk of BRD.

This may have been impacted by the relatively small window-size (transcript ±25 kb) selected for sampling SNPs in the vicinity of genes that were differentially regulated in the bronchial lymph node in response to pathogen challenge. However, as has been previously observed in human complex disease GWAS studies, the largest effect QTL are rarely found within transcripts and are much more frequently located in intergenic and upstream regions that are inferred to have regulatory effects. This is consistent with our results, which suggest that the largest effect BRD-risk QTL are generally not located within close proximity to genes involved in the immune response to pathogen challenge, suggesting that these QTL must have regulatory roles on gene expression.

Analysis of the combined CA and NM cohorts likely also contributed to this problem due to phenotype divergence that increased the complexity of the underlying genetic architecture of the trait due to the expansion of the range of pathogens responsible for disease in the two states (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par41">Nevertheless, imputation of WGS variants facilitated the refinement of QTL mapping in these data.

While this approach is not by itself capable of inferring the causality of any associated variant, the biological relevance of genes, particularly those differentially expressed in response to pathogen infection suggests the utility of using imputed WGS data for refining the numbers of variants that potentially may be causal for their effects on risk of disease. Imputation also enabled the identification of relatively small regions, which could be targeted for further fine mapping using variants missing from the 1KBGP data and indels. This approach could also benefit from the identification of regulatory regions within the QTL regions and specifically targeting the genotyping of variants within regulatory regions located within QTL.

Perhaps more striking, was the inability using WGS imputed variation, to predict disease risk across states when training was restricted to data from a single state.

Our estimate of a negative genetic correlation between the risk of BRD in two U.S. regions suggests that this may be the situation.

Pathogen diagnostic data obtained from mid-nasal and deep-nasopharyngeal swabs taken from each calf made it clear that there were very different pathogen profiles present in the two state cohorts, and consequently, disease status classification must be interpreted from the perspective of the pathogens to which the animals were exposed in each environment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par47">Examination of the large effect QTL found in the analysis of data from one state cohort but not in the other provides some biological clues as to the roles of these QTL. <italic>PPARG</italic> was detected as a QTL in the analysis of the NM cohort, but was not among the 100 most significant QTL in either the CA or combined CA and NM cohort GWAS. <italic>PPARG</italic> is a transcription factor that has been shown to mediate immune responses in a pathogen-specific manner.

This was accomplished by selecting variants from regions of the genome that had been identified as associated with risk of BRD in the combined CA and NM cohort GWAS and also regions containing genes for which expression in the bronchial lymph node was perturbed in animals experimentally challenged with single pathogens that cause BRD. Our intention was to enrich the prediction model for variants that were more likely to be trait associated and to reduce the noise in the prediction model created by the estimation of a multitude of SNP effects for variants that are not trait associated. Feature selection reduced the number of variants used in prediction by an order of magnitude relative to the imputed WGS training data, and to a level comparable to the HD training data. The GWAS for the individual state and combined CA and NM cohorts revealed BRD risk QTL segregating in both cohorts despite the differences in pathogen profiles in the two environments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We also anticipated that smaller effect QTL might reliably be captured by including variants located in the genomic regions harbouring genes for which expression was perturbed in the normal immune response to BRD pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">In a replicated two-fold cross validation analysis, the RNA-Seq feature selected set performed no better than the model that used the HD variants suggesting that cis-acting variants within genes involved in the normal immune response to pathogens responsible for BRD do not significantly impact risk of BRD. The identification of trans-acting loci such as transcription factors that control the regulation of expression of these genes might therefore be a more valuable approach for feature selection. Moreover, improvement in prediction accuracy using the feature selection model that combined variants located in both the QTL and RNA-Seq feature selected variant sets appears to primarily have been driven by the overestimated accuracy increases from QTL feature selection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">The accuracy of GP trained in one half of the combined CA and NM cohorts and validated in the other half of the cohorts using the QTL feature selected variants was estimated to increase by 73% over the accuracy achieved using the HD data. However, when we implemented 5-fold and 135-fold cross validation analyses to remove the data for animals for which GPs were to be produced from the QTL identification and training model analyses, the accuracies of the produced GPs did not differ from those using the HD markers in the two-fold cross validation analyses (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). This was not due to a difference in calibration between the analyses. Accuracies of GPs produced using the HD assay did not differ (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) for any of the three cohorts using the two-fold or 5-fold cross validation analyses. From this, we conclude that the GP accuracies produced by the two-fold cross validation for the feature selection sets are significantly biased upward by the a priori use of the data to identify QTL regions. However, the produced GPs do not appear to be biased. Eliminating the analyses that involved training using the data for one state and validating in the other (where the genetic correlation between BRD risk was − 0.36), the mean regression of GP on observed BRD phenotype was 1.04 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> Table S1).</p><p id="Par52">We anticipated that the use of variants located in QTL regions identified in the joint analysis of the CA and NM cohorts would generate GPs based upon immunological risk variants with common directional effects on the risk of BRD across the two state environments. While the analyses based on these markers produced strongly biased GP accuracies within each of the states, accuracies of the GPs trained in one state and validated in the other became positive using the QTL feature selected variants, despite the negative genetic correlation between risk of BRD in the two states. While the sample size of 2703 individuals is insufficient for the accurate identification of QTL within and across the CA and NM cohorts and also for evaluating the QTL feature selection approach, this result merits additional consideration.

If the regional pathogen profiles tend to be stable in their composition across time, it may be most effective to develop region-specific BRD risk predictions, and associate these with specific regional environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Alternatively, a national genetic evaluation could focus selection on the variants that influencing risk of disease in a pathogen agnostic manner. The feature selection approaches implemented here targeted the latter goal, but did not specifically attempt to functionally validate or elucidate the biology associated with variation within the selected genomic regions. For example, a QTL may be specific to an individual pathogen that is present in both regional cohorts or may be specific to all bacterial or viral pathogens that cause BRD. This level of refinement in our understanding of BRD will require considerably more data aggregation, improved mapping resolution and biological experimentation. Selection without regard to these potential GxE effects will be effective only if the heritability of disease risk across all environments is moderate or the pathogen profiles within specific regions of the country remain stable in time. Indeed, this may explain why BRD has been persistent despite the considerable cost associated with animal infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Imputation</title><p id="Par54">In both empirical and theoretical studies, others have demonstrated limited improvements in prediction accuracy using imputed WGS variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Accurate WGS imputation may address this issue, however, this appears to be difficult to accomplish if we the imputation process requires strong LD between typed and untyped markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, current imputation algorithms generally exploit a haplotype matching strategy which can accurately impute common haplotypes.

One approach towards the amelioration of this issue is to assign annotations to classes of variants, and then fit classes separately in a mixture model of normal distributions with different scale parameters. If a class, such as variants within transcripts found to be trait-associated in an RNA-Seq study, is enriched for alleles that directly cause trait variation, the power to detect these causal variants should be improved by increasing the prior likelihood of association for members of this class.

To the extent that annotations and genotype imputation can be accomplished at high levels of accuracy, this approach should be beneficial for variant selection for GP. However, at present, both variant annotation and imputation are limited in extent and accuracy, and rather than restricting inclusion to specific variants, we defined sets of genomic regions (based on windows of SNPs) of interest and included all variants within these windows. Once the windows had been defined, the Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (BSLMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] implemented in GEMMA had no additional information about which of the variants within each window may be important. BSLMM assumes that only a small proportion of the supplied variants have large effects that contribute to variation in the phenotype and estimates which of the supplied variants have large effects, the magnitudes of these effects and the residual additive genetic merit of each individual due to the remaining small effect variants. Within each feature selected window, if a causal variant acted by disrupting an enhancer, for example, BSLMM would be expected to identify this variant as a large effect variant. BSLMM would also identify other loci in strong LD with the causal variant and sampling effects could lead to some of these having stronger associations than the causal variant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">We investigated approaches to generate GP for risk of BRD across two geographic regions of the U.S. that appear to differ for their pathogen profiles. While the animals were all phenotyped using a common robust evaluation protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the genetic architecture of the trait differed profoundly between the two U.S. states. We hypothesized that imputation of HD genotypes to WGS variants in conjunction with biologically guided feature selection may enable the development of genomic prediction models in Holstein cattle with utility across geographic regions. While the genome sequence resources for WGS imputation and the annotation of identified genomic variants in cattle are limited, the continued improvement of these resources should enable this development. The use of the BSLMM applied to feature selected variants for genomic prediction reduces the need for assigning annotations or identifying causality when utilizing millions of variants to model a complex biological phenotype.</p><p id="Par60">Further work is required to investigate the pathogen-specific genetic architectures of susceptibility to BRD and the extent to which pathogen profiles differ spatially and temporally nationwide to enable the development of GP models that will reduce disease prevalence nationally. This will require an extensive ongoing effort to capture animal phenotypes and genotypes and to assess pathogen profiles nationwide. Selection to reduce BRD prevalence will require a better understanding of the genetic architecture of resistance to specific pathogens, the magnitudes of genetic correlations between pathogen-specific BRD phenotypes, casual variant discovery and improved genomic resources for imputation and variant annotation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par61">Whole blood samples were collected from a commercial calf raising facility in CA and from commercial Holstein dairy herds in NM as described by Neibergs et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. BRD cases and controls were sampled by first identifying a clinically ill animal and then selecting a nearby contemporary animal without signs of illness. Calves were scored for five BRD indicator traits using the McGuirk Scoring system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Controls were followed in time to ensure that they did not develop illness after the initial observation. Extracted DNA samples from all animals were assayed with the Illumina BovineHD assay. Variants from both the CA and NM cohorts were filtered on allele frequency and per animal call rate, resulting in 654,044 loci available for analysis. After final filtering on phenotype availability, 2703 samples were available, with 1978 and 725 being from CA and NM, respectively. A complete description of the sampling, phenotyping and genotyping processes was provided in Neibergs et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Anesthetic and euthanasia methods</title><p id="Par62">The experimental animals were not anesthetized or euthanized in order to conduct this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Imputation pipeline</title><sec id="Sec31"><title>A/B to ref/alt</title><p id="Par63">The first step in genotype imputation required converting Illumina A/B allele calls to reference assembly sequence variant and alternate alleles. The HD variant genotypes were converted from A/B allele calls to reference/alternate (ref/alt) alleles in an allelic dose format (0 for homozygous for the reference assembly allele, 1 for heterozygote, and 2 for homozygous for the alternate allele). This conversion process was accomplished using an analysis of 94 animals that had been both whole genome sequenced and also genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD or BovineSNP50 genotyping platforms. This empirical verification of the SNP allele identities was necessary as the BovineSNP50 manifest (which was carried across to the manifest for the HD assay) was found to contain a very high percentage of inconsistent A/B to ref./alt allele mappings. These inconsistencies appear to have been caused by changes in strand orientations within the reference assembly between the time of the design of the BovineSNP50 assay and the release of the UMD3.1 reference assembly. This was described in greater detail in Taylor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Reference genome sequences</title><p id="Par64">The reference set of haplotyped WGS variants used for imputation was the Run5 data from the 1KBGP, which included 39,721,988 variants phased and imputed in 1578 animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The Run5 data set included WGS for 450 Holstein animals, to which we added WGS for 29 Holstein animals sampled from the BRD GWAS study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These animals were sequenced to an average depth of 11.94X and variants were called as described in Taylor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The sites included in the imputation reference set included only the SNP variants found in the Run5 1KBGP data. We removed all indels from the Run5 1KBGP data, due to previously identified issues with Samtools indel calling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. High indel genotyping error rates can significantly impact phasing and genotype imputation quality; particularly with imputation algorithms such as FImpute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] that do not explicitly attempt to model genotype errors. Only genotypes for the SNPs identified within the Run5 1KBGP data were extracted from the variant calls for our 29 independently sequenced Holsteins. Phasing and imputation of these data were performed using FImpute.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Filtering</title><p id="Par65">We filtered every variant that had an allele frequency &lt; 5% or a genotype variance &lt; 0.1% in the WGS imputed data set for the 2703 Holsteins. A separate imputation run in which the 29 sequenced Holsteins were excluded from the reference animal set was used to assess imputation accuracy. The genotypes imputed for these 29 animals from their HD genotypes were correlated with the genotypes independently called from their WGS after converting both to dosage format as previously described. The resulting set of site-specific imputation accuracies (correlations between imputed and WGS-called genotypes) was then used to filter individual variants that had accuracies of &lt; 65%. The 95% confidence interval for a correlation coefficient of 65% based on 29 samples is from 37 to 82% and while this threshold will include variants with low imputation accuracy, we wished to avoid filtering variants that were imputed with a reasonably high accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Imputation accuracy and reference assembly quality</title><p id="Par66">Many variants included in the 1KGBP imputation reference sequence set were not observed in our 29 sequenced animals and the quality of genotype imputation could not be assessed for these loci. Consequently, we decided to classify the accuracy of imputation by variably sized regions of the genome to identify those regions for which genotype imputation could not be accurately accomplished due to local misassemblies or misoriented contigs within the reference assembly. To accomplish this, we applied GenWin to the SNP genotype imputation accuracy correlation estimates to identify genomic regions for which SNP genotypes were imputed with consistently low accuracy. Windows were analysed using an initial window size of 10 kb and GenWin pooled adjacent windows for which imputation accuracies were similar. All variants within windows for which the average imputation accuracy was &lt; 65% were removed from the data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) including SNPs that were not detected in the 29 sequenced animals. Less than 30% of the SNPs had direct estimates of their imputation accuracy either because the sample of 29 sequenced animals was not sufficient to capture the majority of the variants segregating in Holsteins, or because the multibreed reference panel resulted in the imputation of genotypes for variants that were not segregating in Holsteins.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Association analysis</title><sec id="Sec36"><title>Model</title><p id="Par67">Association analysis was performed in GEMMA using a univariate linear mixed models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

The model also included a random effect for the additive genetic merit of each animal and a random residual term that contained residual additive genetic effects that are not in complete linkage disequilibrium with the markers included in the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and non-additive genetic, permanent and temporary environmental effects. The GRM was constructed using a random sample of 10% (<italic>N</italic> = 928,258) of the genomic sites represented in the imputed WGS genotype data approximately consistent with number of SNPs present on the HD assay. For the analyses of the HD genotype data all SNPs were used to form the GRM.
