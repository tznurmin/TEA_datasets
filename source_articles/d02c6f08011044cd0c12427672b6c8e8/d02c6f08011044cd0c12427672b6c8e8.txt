Background Mucormycosis are rare but often life-threatening infections seen in immunocompromised, diabetic, and organ transplant patients [ 1 ]. These infections are difficult to treat and with an increase in the number of diabetic patients and organ transplants, in the future such infections are likely to increase [ 1 , 2 ]. $i$Rhizopus$/i$ spp. accounts for the majority of the mucormycosis infections [ 1 ]. Results in recent decades suggest that apoptosis may play an important role in both establishment and clearance of fungal infections [ 3 ]. In response to fungal infections, the oxidative burst by host immune cells could help in infection clearance by triggering apoptosis in the fungus [ 4 , 5 ]. Also, pathogen-induced apoptosis in host immune cells could help the pathogen to establish the infection [ 6 ]. Thus, the success of an infection partly depends on the outcome of such host pathogen interactions. It has been shown that extracts from the filamentous fungus could induce apoptosis in human cells [ 6 , 7 ], but the identity of the protein/factor responsible for the induction of apoptosis remains unknown. In recent decades, it has also been established that in many organisms cyt c plays an important role in apoptosis [ 8 , 9 ]. During apoptosis, cyt c is released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and binds to apoptosis protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) thus triggering a caspase activation cascade [ 8 ]. For example, in humans, cyt c can activate caspase-3 in cell-free activation assay [ 9 ]. The first evidence of the existence of apoptosis in fungi came from the study by Medeo et al. of a $i$Saccharomyces cerevisiae$/i$ mutant that showed signs of apoptosis [ 10 ]. Since then, many homologous mammalian apoptotic proteins were discovered in budding yeast [ 11 ]. In an important finding, using deletion mutants which were unable to produce functional cyt c, Silva et al. presented the first evidence that cyt c is involved in hyperosmotic stress induced yeast apoptosis [ 12 ]. However, the nature of the role cyt c plays in apoptosis of filamentous fungi like $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ remains unknown. To characterize $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c, we cloned the gene for cyt c from $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ in $i$E. coli$/i$. The purified cyt c was compared with two mammalian cyt c (horse and human). We selected $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c as a candidate for this study mainly for two reasons. First, this fungal cyt c is distantly related to mammalian cyt c and its biochemical properties are largely unknown. Secondly, $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ is a pathogenic fungus and any information gained on the pro-apoptotic activity of cyt c may also contribute to the identification of better therapeutic targets. We found that cyt c of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ has similar biochemical properties to mammalian cyt c. Results and discussion A 19-fold purification was achieved for recombinant $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c using a three step process involving ammonium sulphate precipitation, cation exchange and gel filtration chromatography (Fig.  1 , Table  1 ). The purified recombinant cyt c protein eluted from gel filtration column with absorption ratio 410/280 nm of &gt;4.0 (Fig.  1b , Table  1 ). Purity was also checked by SDS electrophoresis. The eluted cyt c produced one band, which had an apparent MW of ca. 14 kDa (Fig.  1c ). Since this is the first report on purification of recombinant $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c, we compared our purification results with those reported by others using similar plasmids. We obtained ~9 mg of cyt c with a 410/280 ratio of &gt;4 from 1 L of $i$E. coli$/i$ culture. Our yield was similar to the reported yield for human cyt c of &gt;8 mg L −1 [ 13 ]. Patel et al. reported a yield of ~15 mg L −1 for horse cyt c [ 14 ]. However, in that work the authors only performed a two-step purification (ammonium sulphate precipitation and a cation exchange column) [ 14 ]. Our yield was only marginally lower if we compare our yield after the second purification step (Table  1 ).

Efforts to further purify the native protein using an additional anion exchange column to trap impurities did not result in any improvement.

Band marked with an $i$arrow$/i$ indicate the position of protein band identified as cyt c. c Absorption spectra of the oxidized (---) and reduced form ( _ ) of the native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c. The oxidized form shows a peak in the Soret region at 409 nm while in the reduced form the Soret peak shifts to 415 nm This concurs with a previous study that reported difficulties in purifying this protein from $i$R. oryzae$/i$ (syn. to $i$R. arrhizus$/i$) to high purity [ 15 , 16 ]. The relative molecular weight determined for the native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c by SDS-PAGE was 12.55 ± 1.27 kDa (Fig.  2b ) in agreement with expectations for its molecular weight. Identity of both, the native and the recombinant protein bands was unequivocally confirmed by MALDI tandem mass spectroscopy (Fig.  3 and Additional file 1 : Figure S1). Fig. 3 MS spectra of the recombinant Rhizopus cyt c and MS/MS spectra of native Rhizopus cyt c collected on a MALDI TOF/TOF instrument. a MS spectra of the recombinant protein digested with trypsin. b MS/MS of precursor peptide (1166.67 Da) from the native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c protein digested with trypsin. Mascot online server was used to confirm the identity of both native and the recombinant proteins The UV–vis spectra of the oxidized native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c show peaks at 409 and 529 nm and in the reduced state, α and β peaks are prominent at 549 and 520 nm, respectively (Fig.  2c ). Similar values were seen for the recombinant $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c. These values are close to other type-c cytochromes, thus suggesting a similar heme environment (Table  2 ). Table 2 Comparison of the spectral properties of horse, human and $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c Cyt c α max (nm) β max (nm) α/β Charge transfer band (nm) Horse 550 521 1.87 695 Human 549 520 2.86 695 nRhizopus 549 520 1.87 700 rRhizopus 549 520 1.87 699 nRhizopus: native cyt c from $i$R. arrhizus$/i$; rRhizopus: recombinant cyt c from $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ The presence of an absorption maximum at ~700 nm in both recombinant and the native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ ferri cytochrome (Additional file 2 : Figure S2A &amp; B) suggests that, like in other c-type cytochromes, methionine is one of the axial heme ligands. Additionally, sequence alignment shows that residues corresponding to Met-80 and His-18 are conserved in 14 fungal cyt c [ 17 ], as well as in human and horse cyt c. The redox potential of native and recombinant $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c was found to be similar to that of human and horse cyt c, respectively, with no statistically significant difference (Fig.  4 and Additional file 3 : Figure S3). The redox potential measurements for human and horse cyt c with 263.43 and 268.64 mV, respectively, were in close agreement with earlier reported values validating our technique [ 18 , 19 ]. The redox potential measurements of native and recombinant $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c were 266.90 and 270.04 mV and statistically the same. These results further support structural similarity between the recombinant and native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c proteins. Fig. 4 Peroxidase activity of native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c as a function of substrate (H 2 O 2 ) concentration. Shown here is the amount of oxidized ABTS (y-axis) formed per minute at different H 2 O 2 concentrations (X-axis). $i$Error bars$/i$ represent the standard deviation A major portion of cyt c remains loosely associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane via ionic interactions with the negatively charged mitochondrion-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin. Kagan et al. had shown that cardiolipin specific peroxidase activity of cardiolipin bound cyt c may play an important role in triggering apoptosis by aiding in the release of pro-apoptotic proteins, including cyt c, from the matrix of the mitochondria [ 20 ]. Furthermore, peroxidase activity assay provides an indirect measure of heme accessibility and we therefore compared the peroxidase activities of mammalian and $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c. The peroxidase activity of native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c was found to be low compared to other known peroxidases, which is a general characteristic of type-c cytochromes. Recombinant cyt c showed a higher K cat and V max compared to native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c. These variations are most likely due to the higher purity of the recombinant protein compared to native one (Table  2 , Table  3 ). Also, a high peroxidase activity could be related to partial denaturation and thus a more accessible heme in the non-recombinant cyt c. A partial denaturation can involve the breaking of the methionine coordination that leaves the heme more accessible for catalysis [ 21 ]. However, this is ruled out by the UV-spectra of the recombinant cyt c because they show the presence of the charge transfer band thus indicating that methionine coordination is intact (Additional file 2 : Figure S2).

On the other hand, judging from K M values the affinity of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c seems to be lower than human cyt c, and very similar compared to horse cyt c (Table  3 ). The K M value measured for horse cyt c was in close agreement with Kim et al. [ 22 ] but varied from the one reported by Randi et al. [ 23 ]. It is important to note that we used non-linear regression to analyze the kinetics while the two cited studies used Lineweaver-Burk plots, a method considered less reliable [ 24 ]. We noted the presence of the cyt c in good amounts in a commercial preparation of a secreted lipase of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ (Fig.  2 ). Interestingly, in an earlier study, the authors have indicated the presence of a “soluble factor” in $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ extract that can activate caspase, but they did not identify this factor [ 7 ]. Based on these observations, we tried to verify whether this unknown water-soluble factor could be cyt c present in the supernatant of the $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cultures or not. Efforts to locate the cyt c in supernatant fractions with heme staining (data not shown) and using an antibody against cyt c were not successful (Additional file 4 : Figure S4). These results suggest that under our test conditions, the protein is not secreted into the supernatant. However, the possibilities that the protein might be secreted in response to some special cue, or in trace amounts, could not be ruled out. In the cell free caspase-3 activation assay, compared to all cyt c tested, the recombinant $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c showed the lowest activity. Its activity was similar to the negative control, a cell lysate with asparaginase-II (Fig.  5 ). The native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c showed a statistically significant ($i$P$/i$ &lt; 0.05) higher caspase-3 signal but under the same conditions no statistically significant difference was observed in the signals of recombinant $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c and the negative asparaginase-II control (Fig.  5 ). Fig. 5 Comparison of cell-free caspase-3 activation by horse, human and R. arrhizus cyt c. Caspase-3 activation was followed at 405 nm and normalized to the horse cyt c signal. rRA represents the recombinant and nRA the native cyt c from R. arrhizus, while AspII represents the negative control contains asparaginase-II (no cyt c). Each column represents the mean of independent measurements, with $i$error bars$/i$ representing the standard deviation. The initial incubation to activate caspase was performed with samples at 10 μM final concentration. The native cyt c signal (*) was significantly different from the others ($i$P$/i$ &lt; 0.05) In our $i$in vitro$/i$ caspase-3 assay, we did not observe any caspase-3 activity in the aqueous extracts prepared from the $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ culture (Additional file 5 : Figure S5). This result indicate that the source of previously reported activity in the aqueous extract is unlikely to be cyt c [ 7 ]. Compared to recombinant cyt c, higher caspase-3 activation by native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c could be due to the presence of other unidentified factor/s. Identity of these factors is a matter of further investigation and beyond the scope of the present study. Additionally, the activation differences between native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ and the horse cyt c could be due to the variations in distribution of positive patches on the $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c surface, which are known to be critical for cyt c/Apaf-1 interaction. Cyt c and Apaf-1 interact through an extensive region. Many lysine residues (7, 8, 25, 39 and 72) spread across the surface of cyt c are known to be important for this interaction. Disruption of these residues by site directed mutagenesis has been shown to abolish or lower the ability of horse and human cytochrome to activate caspases [ 25 , 26 ]. In the case of native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$, the reduction in caspase-3 activation was seen when compared to horse cyt c. Sequence comparison with horse cyt c revealed that in the native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c two of these lysine residues (7 and 25) are occupied by alanine (Fig.  6 ). We propose that these changes to hydrophobic non-polar groups (Ala) could decrease cyt c affinity for Apaf-1. The lower caspase-3 activation by the native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c is a potential reflection of this effect. Indeed, these two lysine residues (7 and 25) were demonstrated to be essential for Apaf-1 binding, since a 10–100 fold drop in caspase activity was observed by Yu et al. when these amino acids were mutated in combination with other Apaf-1 interacting residues in horse cyt c [ 25 ]. Fig. 6 a Sequence alignment of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c with human, horse, and budding yeast cyt c. The $i$shaded$/i$ areas are the residues (in horse) essentially involved in Apaf-1 binding. Residues in $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ showing charge reversal/neutralization (with respect to horse Lys) substitutions are shown in $i$green$/i$. The numbering position of residues is with respect to horse cyt c. b Protein models of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ and horse cyt c showing positions of 3 important lysine residues involved in Apaf-1 binding. From $i$left$/i$ to $i$right$/i$: $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ model (generated using Swiss-model homology modeling server) and horse cyt c (PDB ID-1HRC). In $i$R. arrhizus$/i$, two residues important for Apaf-1 binding, lysine 7 and 25 ($i$red$/i$) are substituted by alanine. Another important lysine residue ($i$blue$/i$) is conserved in both $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ and horse cyt c. Both images were generated using PyMOL In $i$Saccharomyces cerevisiae cyt c$/i$, a tri-methylation at lysine 72 was attributed for being responsible for its lower caspase activation potential [ 26 ]. We reasoned that it is possible that a similar tri-methylation on the K72 in $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c could also partly account for its lower caspase activity as seen in our assays (Fig.  5 ). However, our MALDI data does not support the presence of Lys-72 methylation (Additional file 6 : Figure S6). We also found four additional lysine substitutions in $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c (K5A, K22E, K88A &amp; K100E) that have not been studied before, and could potentially contribute to its reduced caspase-3 activation (Fig.  6 ). It will be interesting to see if an $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ mutant with A7K and A25K mutations shows increased caspase-3 activation to the level similar to that of horse cyt c, since this would help to elucidate the role of other lysine substitutions seen in $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c. Conclusions We have reported here a comparative characterization of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on recombinant purification and biochemical characterization of the $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c. The mitochondrial proteins are attractive targets for new antifungal drugs [ 27 ]. A better understanding of the role of specific sequences in cyt c’s ability to induce apoptosis and its differences with mammalian cyt c could lead to the identification of methods for exclusive targeting of this fungal pathogen. It will be interesting to see if the amino acid differences in cyt c of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ could provide it with sufficient specificity to induce apoptosis exclusively in fungal cells. If this turns out to be the case, designing of fungi specific apoptosis inducing drugs may be possible. Although results of targeting human cancer cells by actively inducing apoptosis using mammalian cyt c delivery have been promising [ 28 , 29 ], replicating them in the fungal cells could be very challenging due to the presence of their cell wall. Our results show the ability of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c to activate caspase-3. This finding indicates that this pathogen could potentially use a similar mechanism in vivo to establish infections. To explore the possibility of existence of such mechanism in vivo, a study of clinical isolates and samples from infected patients would be helpful. At present such studies are impeded by the lack of our knowledge about the role of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c in apoptosis. This study will help catalyze exploration into the possible involvement of cyt c in establishing mucormycosis infections. Methods Gene cloning and protein purification Recombinant $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c was expressed from a construct made by modifying the pBTR1 plasmid [ 13 ]. pBTR1 was a gift from Gary Pielak (Addgene plasmid # 22468). It contained human cyt c gene and a heme lyase gene from $i$Saccharomyces cerevisiae$/i$. The lyase gene is essential for heme incorporation into cyt c protein. In the modified plasmid (pBRA), human cyt c was replaced with the gene encoding $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c. The sequence coding for $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c was commercially synthesized (GenScript) and ligated into pBTR1 vector (without the human cyt c gene) using Gibson Assembly (NEB). The primers utilized and steps performed to obtain pBRA are provided in the Additional file (primer and vector details are provided in Additional file 7 : Figure S7). pBRA was transformed into BL21(DE3)T1 R cells (Sigma). The bacterial cultures were grown in TB media (12 gmL −1 tryptone, 24 gmL −1 yeast extract, 8 mL glycerol, 2.3 gL −1 KH 2 PO 4 and 12.5 gL −1 K 2 HPO 4 ) containing ampicillin (100 mgL −1 ) at 37 °C under constant shaking at 220 rpm. A 5 mL overnight culture grown from a single colony was used to inoculate a 500 mL culture. The culture was harvested after 18 h of growth at 37 °C by centrifuging at 7000 g at 4 °C. The pellet obtained was incubated with lysozyme 3 gL −1 and 3 mg of DNase 1 in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 6.8 and 1 mM EDTA) for 8 h at 4 °C with stirring. The lysis mixture was sonicated on ice for 5 min. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 7000 g on a Sorvall RC 6 plus (Thermo Scientific) at 4 °C. Ammonium sulfate was added slowly to the supernatant at 4 °C under constant stirring to a final concentration of 350 gL −1 . The resulting precipitate was centrifuged at 7000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing cyt c was dialyzed using a 3.5 kDa dialysis membrane overnight against 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. Dialyzed protein was loaded on a HiTrap SP Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A (40 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.8). Bound protein was eluted with elution buffer B (40 mM sodium phosphate at pH 6.8 and 1 M NaCl) using a linear gradient from 0 % B to 100 % B over a 7 column volume. Peak fractions with an absorbance ratio of 410/280 nm &gt; 2.5 were pooled and loaded on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Protein elution from the Superdex 200 column was followed by absorption at 410 and 280 nm. Peak fractions were analyzed by loading onto a 15 % SDS-PAGE. Native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c was purified using lipase of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ obtained from Sigma using a similar scheme as that of the recombinant protein. Human and horse cyt c were used as controls in all the assays performed unless otherwise stated. Human cyt c was expressed in $i$E. coli$/i$ using plasmid pBRT1 and purification was done as described by Olteanu et al. [ 13 ]. Horse heart cyt c was purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. UV–vis spectroscopy All spectra were measured using a UV–Vis NanoDrop 2000/2000c (Thermo Scientific) spectrophotometer except for the charge transfer band (CTB). The CTB region was measured on a UV-2450 Shimadzu spectrophotometer, with a slit width of 0.5 nm. The peak location was determined by using the picking algorithm of the UV-Probe 2.33 software (Shimadzu). Trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry In-gel trypsin digestion was performed using 500–1000 ng of both native and recombinant $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c as described [ 30 ]. In brief, the gel-eluted peptides resulting from trypsin digestion were first vacuum dried and later purified on a C18 reverse phase tip column (Millipore) using the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Trypsin-digested peptides were eluted in a total volume of 5 μl of acetonitrile and 0.1 % trifluoro acetic acid solution (50:50 $i$v$/i$/$i$v$/i$). The purified peptides were directly spotted onto the MALDI plate following the dried droplet method [ 31 ]. The matrix solution used contained 5 mg/mL α-cyano-4-hydrooxycinnamic acid (HCCA, Sigma) in acetonitrile and 0.1 % trifluoro acetic acid (50:50 $i$v$/i$/$i$v$/i$). Tandem mass spectrometric analysis was performed using an ABSCIEX 4800 Plus MALDI TOF/TOF™ Analyzer in Top 6 mode. The spectra were collected in positive ion reflector mode with 500–1000 laser shots per spectrum. Protein identification was performed using the Mascot server (Matrix Science, http://www.matrixscience.com/search_form_select.html). Redox potential The redox potential of $i$R. arrhizus cyt$/i$ c was determined as described [ 18 ] with some minor modifications. Briefly, 100 mM stock solutions of potassium ferrocyanide (ferroCN), potassium ferricyanide (ferriCN), and (+)-sodium L-ascorbate were prepared in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. Prior to use, all solutions were vacuum degasified and purged with nitrogen for 2–3 min. The absorbance of samples was recorded at 550 nm using a NanoDrop 2000/2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). A plot of log([ferroCN]/[ferriCN]) vs. log([ferrocyt c]/[ferricyt c]) was drawn using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Peroxidase assay Cyt c peroxidase activity was measured as described [ 22 ]. Briefly, each reaction was performed in a total reaction volume of 150 μL with 50 μM 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), 2.5 μM for human and horse cyt c, and 1.5 μM for native $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ cyt c. The concentration of cyt c was determined using the absorption coefficient of 29.5 mM −1  cm −1 at 550 nm [ 32 ]. Each reaction was followed for 40 s by recording the absorption of oxidized ABTS at 405 nm. The concentration of oxidized ABTS was calculated using the extinction coefficient of 36.8 mM −1  cm −1 at 405 nm. For each reaction with varying H 2 O 2 concentrations (ranging from 1.0 to 28 mM), initial rates were measured using the linear part of the absorption curve. All absorption readings were made using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer using a cell of 1 cm path length at 25 °C. The Michaelis-Menten constants K M , K cat and V max were determined by nonlinear regression curve fitting using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Cell free caspase-3 activation assay HeLa cells were grown to 90 % confluency, harvested, and disrupted as described [ 29 ]. Prior to disruption, approximately a total of 2 × 10 7 cells were suspended in 2 mL of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM Na-EDTA, 1 mM Na-EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 250 mM sucrose, and 0.1 % $i$v$/i$/$i$v$/i$ protease inhibitor cocktail (2 mM AEBSF, 0.3 μM aprotinin, 130 μM bestatin, 14 mM E-64, 1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM EDTA). The HeLa cell extract (lysate) was stored at −80 °C for at least 5 days before use. Total protein content in the lysate was determined by the Bradford method. Each cyt c sample was incubated with the lysate in a total volume of 50 μL at 37 °C for 1 h using a Mastercycler (Eppendorf). This incubation mixture consisted of 1 mM dATP, 4 mg/mL total protein from lysate, and 10 μM cyt c; cyt c concentration was determined using the absorption coefficient 29.5 mM −1  cm −1 at 550 nm [ 32 ]. Immediately thereafter, caspase-3 activation was performed as per the manufacturer’s protocol (CaspACE™ Colorimetric Assay System, G7220). Briefly, 20 μL from the incubation mixture was added to 78 μL of a mixture containing 128.2 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 12.82 % $i$w$/i$/$i$v$/i$ sucrose, 0.1282 % $i$w$/i$/$i$v$/i$ CHAPS, 2.56 % $i$v$/i$/$i$v$/i$ DMSO, and 12.8 mM DTT. Afterwards, 2 μL of 10 mM caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-pNA) was added. The plate was incubated overnight, and the absorbance measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek-Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader). All measurements were performed in triplicate. The activation by horse cyt c was considered 100 %, and other results were normalized relative to horse cyt c. In these assays, a negative control that contained HeLa cell lysate with asparaginase-II, an unrelated non-apoptotic protein, was used. Asparaginase-II was purified from $i$E. coli$/i$ as described earlier [ 33 ]. Additionally, an aqueous extract of $i$R. arrhizus$/i$ was also made and tested for caspase-3 activation (Additional file 5 : Figure S6).
