Here we show that the number of peripheral tolerogenic CD1c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) and the levels of serum FLT3L are significantly decreased in SLE patients especially with lupus nephritis, compared to healthy controls. Transplantation of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) significantly up-regulates peripheral blood CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs and serum FLT3L. Mechanistically, UC-MSCs express FLT3L that binds to FLT3 on CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs to promote the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of tolerogenic CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs. Conversely, reduction of FLT3L with small interfering RNA in MSCs abolishes the up-regulation of tolerogenic CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in lupus patients treated with MSCs. Interferon-γ induces FLT3L expression in UC-MSCs through JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Thus, allogeneic MSCs might suppress inflammation in lupus through up-regulating tolerogenic DCs.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">Promising pilot clinical trials of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy of lupus await validation in larger, controlled trials.

In spite of the significant variation of disease severity among SLE patients, the dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses are universal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. An insight into the underlying pathology is important to develop optimal therapies.</p><p id="Par4">Dendritic cells (DCs) are innate immune cells that play key roles in initiating and regulating immunity by sensing and integrating signals from a wide range of pathogens and tissue damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Previous studies about DCs in SLE mainly focused on the plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, but the contribution of conventional DCs (cDCs) to SLE pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Plasticity of DCs with different maturity status and function allows them to be exploited as tolerogenic DCs for their clinical application in autoimmune disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Previous studies have suggested tolerogenic DC subsets in human displaying immunoregulatory functions, such as CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in human peripheral blood and in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Compared with other conventional DC subsets, poly I:C-activated CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs express low levels of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, as well as stimulatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12, to induce IFN-γ-secreting T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In response to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E.coli</italic>) stimulation, human peripheral CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs produced only low levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-12. Instead, they produced high levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and regulatory molecules indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). These CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs suppressed T-cell proliferation in an IL-10-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Similarly, human liver resident CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs produced large amounts of IL-10 upon LPS stimulation and induced immunoregulatory T regulatory cells and IL-4-producing Th2 cells via an IL-10-dependent mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, human pulmonary CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs also exert tolerogenic properties in inducing Treg by IL-27/IL-10/inducible costimulator ligand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, certain CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs might be a crucial DC subtype for ameliorating immune dysfunction and maintaining immune homeostasis. Although previous studies have reported the abnormalities of DCs in SLE, the number and function of tolerogenic CD1c<sup>+</sup>DC subset in lupus patients remain largely unknown.</p><p id="Par5">The cytokine Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-ligand (FLT3L) is a key regulator of DC commitment in hematopoiesis, which regulates the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of haematopoietic cells through the binding to FLT3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Not only do cDCs proliferation depend on FLT3L, but also CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs, as well as their precursors could be specifically elevated by injection of FLT3L in humans and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, researches regarding FLT3L focused mainly on hematopoietic cells and hematological diseases, but few in autoimmune diseases.</p><p id="Par6">Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are non-hematopoietic stem cells that can support the function of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in bone marrow. MSCs possess immunomodulatory properties and functions to immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, including T, B, NK cells and macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. MSCs also regulate DC function by inhibiting their co-stimulatory molecule expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, leading to the suppression of their capacity to initiate naive T cells and immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, it is reported that the immunosuppressive function of MSCs is enhanced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells derived IFN-γ in SLE patients induced MSCs to secret large amount of IDO that suppressed T cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the serum levels of IFN-γ in SLE patients could predict MSCs therapeutic effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, whether MSCs regulate tolerogenic DCs in lupus proinflammatory environment remains unknown.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we determine that the decreased number of tolerogenic CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs due to the deficiency of FLT3L contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE. Allogeneic UC-MSCs promote the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of tolerogenic CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs by up-regulating FLT3L in SLE patients, which could be enhanced by the high level of IFN-γ in lupus environment. Thus, we uncover a previous unrecognized IFN-γ/FLT3L-FLT3/CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs axis that mediates the therapeutic benefit of allogeneic UC-MSCs in lupus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs decrease in SLE patients</title><p id="Par8">We first investigated the numbers of peripheral blood CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in patients with SLE by flow cytometry.

The number of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs was negatively correlated with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) score (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Additionally, SLE patients with lupus nephritis (LN) showed a further reduced percentage of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs than those without nephritis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).

Previous studies have found that FLT3L injection induced expansion of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in human blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, so we determined FLT3L levels in SLE and HC by real-time PCR and ELISA. The mRNA level of FLT3L was significantly decreased in SLE peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), and the protein level in SLE serum was also decreased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In contrast, the mRNA level of FLT3 (CD135) in PBMCs was significantly increased in SLE patients compared with healthy controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). There was a trend towards that FLT3L was negatively correlated with FLT3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Although both FLT3L and CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs were significantly decreased, and FLT3 was significantly increased in SLE patients, the changes of FLT3 and its ligand were smaller than that of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in SLE patients. To determine whether FLT3L could up-regulate CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in vitro, SLE PBMCs were stimulated with different concentrations of recombinant human FLT3L (1, 10, 100 and 500 ng/ml). After stimulation for 48 h, we found that FLT3L up-regulated the number of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in SLE PBMCs, with statistical difference at a concentration of 10 ng/ml (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). FLT3L could also up-regulate the number of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in PBMCs obtained from healthy subjects (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).

The peripheral blood CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs were analyzed before and after U-MSCT in the last 10 patients (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, patient 12–21). We found that after U-MSCT, the expression of the co-stimulatory molecules and HLA-DR of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in freshly isolated peripheral blood of treated SLE did not change significantly. However, LPS-mediated upregulation of CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expressions of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs were significantly decreased in SLE patients after MSCs transplantation compared to before treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3q, r</xref>); similarly, LPS-induced TNFα produced by CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in SLE PBMCs were also significantly decreased after MSCs transplantation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3s</xref>), whereas the level of IL-10 showed no significant change after U-MSCT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3t</xref>).

First, we demonstrated UC-MSCs expressed FLT3L by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>).

To confirm the role of FLT3L on UC-MSCs in the up-regulation of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs, we inhibited FLT3L expression on UC-MSCs with FLT3L siRNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>) and found that the reduction of FLT3L abrogated the up-regulation of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs by UC-MSCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Although the expression levels of IL-6 and HGF on UC-MSCs were significantly higher than FLT3L (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>), inhibiting IL-6 or HGF on UC-MSCs with siRNA had no effect on the ability of UC-MSCs to up-regulate CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>).

The UC-MSCs could significantly up-regulate CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>PBMCs (T cell-depleted PBMCs), which basically concluded that UC-MSCs up-regulating CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs was T cells-independent (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>). Although the expression of FLT3L on PBMCs was significantly higher than that on UC-MSCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>), the autologous PBMCs (CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs depleted) could not up-regulate CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in PBMCs like UC-MSCs did (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). Hence, we could basically exclude the possibility that UC-MSCs indirectly regulate CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs via PBMCs. Then in order to detect whether UC-MSCs directly act on CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs, we isolated CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs from healthy subjects and cultured with UC-MSCs. We found that UC-MSCs significantly increased the proliferation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>) and decreased the apoptosis of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>). Importantly, knock down of FLT3L with specific siRNA significantly reduced the effects of UC-MSCs on the proliferation and apoptosis of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4k, l</xref>). Moreover, we co-cultured UC-MSCs with the PBMCs in which the CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs were depleted, and found UC-MSCs could not drive CD1c<sup>−</sup>PBMCs to differentiate into CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>).

Furthermore, stimulation of UC-MSCs with SLE PBMCs activated JAK/STAT signaling pathways and up-regulated FLT3L protein, which was abrogated by anti-IFN-γ antibody (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f, g</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>).

Herein we have uncovered that UC-MSCs increased tolerogenic CD1c<sup>+</sup> DCs through FLT3L–FLT3 interaction, which could be enhanced by IFN-γ.</p><p id="Par20">In SLE, the breakdown of immune tolerance is widespread and involves autoantigens present in several cell types, making the design of antigen-specific therapy difficult. Current lupus therapies inhibiting both T and B lymphocytes, carry risk of adverse events such as infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. B cell-selective monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 (rituximab) and BAFF (belimumab), despite clinical efficacy in patients with refractory disease, are also associated with long-term treatment-related adverse events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. All available medications for managing lupus, including belimumab, work through the same mode of action, namely nonspecific suppression of the immune system. Our findings revealed that the number of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in PBMCs in SLE patients decreased compared with healthy controls and RA patients (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), and the number of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs was negatively correlated with the SLEDAI score and LN-related indexes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f, g, h, i</xref>), indicating the crucial role of this tolerogenic DC subset in the pathogenesis of SLE, especially in patients with renal abnormalities.</p><p id="Par21">As a key regulator of DCs hematopoiesis, FLT3L regulates the differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of peripheral DCs in human and mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that the level of FLT3L significantly decreased in peripheral blood in patients with SLE, and human recombinant FLT3L stimulation significantly increased the proportion of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in lupus PBMCs in vitro. Thus we considered that the defect of FLT3L was at least partly contributed to the deficiency of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in lupus patients. At odds with our findings, Nakamura and his colleagues reported the serum FLT3L level was slightly higher in patients with SLE compared with normal subjects, but the difference was not statistically significant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This discrepancy could be due to differences in cohort characteristics, the experimental protocols used, or both.</p><p id="Par22">Allogeneic UC-MSCs show unique immunoregulatory functions by suppressing T cell proliferation and inducing the generation of Treg, inhibiting B cell function and IgG production, or promoting the phagocytic activity of macrophage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. However, whether DCs could be regulated by UC-MSCs in lupus microenvironment is rarely known. Our findings revealed that UC-MSCs significantly up-regulated the number of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs via FLT3L in a time-dependent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f, g, m</xref>). In support of this conclusion, we demonstrated that UC-MSCs transplantation remarkably up-regulated the level of serum FLT3L along with an increase of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in lupus patients. Meanwhile, siRNA against FLT3L could abrogate the up-regulation of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs by UC-MSCs.</p><p id="Par23">We further explored the mechanism by which UC-MSCs increased CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs via FLT3L. We reviewed the database of the gene-annotation portal BioGPS (<ext-link xlink:href="http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=2323" ext-link-type="url">http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=2323</ext-link>), and found among mononuclear cells, T cells had the highest expression of FLT3L. Moreover, the expression of FLT3L on PBMCs was significantly higher than that on UC-MSCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). Therefore, there was a possibility that UC-MSCs indirectly regulated CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs via FLT3L in other cells of PBMCs. In order to investigate the contribution of FLT3L on T cells in PBMCs to the increase of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs, the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were extracted from PBMCs. After co-cultured with UC-MSCs, the frequency of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>PBMCs (T cell-depleted PBMCs) was significantly increased as well (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>), which could basically exclude the possibility that UC-MSCs indirectly regulated CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs via T cells. Furthermore, in order to study the contribution of FLT3L on PBMCs to the increase in CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs, we co-cultured PBMCs with UC-MSCs (PM group) or autologous PBMCs in which the CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs were depleted (PP group). After co-culture for 72 h, the frequency of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs was significantly higher in PM group than that in PP group. Moreover, the neutralizing antibody against FLT3L was added to both PM and PP groups, the up-regulation of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs was abolished in PM group, while there was no significant change of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in PP group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). Hence, we could basically exclude the possibility that UC-MSCs indirectly regulate CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs via PBMCs. Although PBMCs expressed higher level of FLT3L than MSCs, the CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs could not be boosted by PBMCs compared with MSCs, suggesting a necessary but not sufficient role of FLT3L in promoting CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs. Then in order to detect whether MSCs directly regulated CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs, we isolated CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs from healthy subjects and showed that MSCs dramatically facilitated the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs, which was similar to effects of FLT3L to FLT3 binding leading to increased DC cell proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In deed, we not only uncovered that FLT3L was expressed on UC-MSCs, but also showed that FLT3 was expressed on CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs. Functionally, UC-MSCs that were pretreated with siRNA against FLT3L have reduced their ability to increase CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs. Thus, the data indicated a role of FLT3L in MSCs-mediated upregulation of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs.</p><p id="Par24">We have previously reported that IFN-γ, which was produced predominantly by lupus CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, was a key factor to enhance immune suppressive function of allogeneic MSCs by induction of IDO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We here extended the function of IFN-γ produced by lupus PBMCs or derived from patient serum in regulating MSCs by showing that it increased the expression of FLT3L in MSCs. This was mediated by JAK/STAT signaling pathway.</p><p id="Par25">In addition, we found the UC-MSCs induced CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in the lupus patients exerted tolerogenic properties by decreasing expression of CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR, decreasing production of TNFα and keeping production of IL-10. These findings suggested the UC-MSCs induced CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs could ameliorate immune dysfunction and maintain immune homeostasis, which might be contribute to the benefits of treatment for SLE.</p><p id="Par26">Although our findings revealed that after UC-MSCs treatment, not merely the number of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs increased significantly, more than the anti-inflammatory function of these tolerogenic DCs tended to be stronger than before, the connection between the changes of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs and the benefit of treatment in MSC treated patients was still unknown. To answer this question, we further classified the last 10 SLE patients receiving U-MSCT (patient 12–21) into remission group and no remission group. Compared with no remission group, the increases of both frequency and absolute number of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs (post U-MSCT—pre U-MSCT) were significantly higher in remission group (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). To sum up, we suggested that the increase of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs number induced by MSCs had contribution to the potential benefit of treatment in MSCs treated SLE patients.</p><p id="Par27">It was reported that MSCs employed various mechanisms to regulate immune cells including DCs. For example, HGF and IL-6 have been reported to affect DC maturation and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We found that in the steady state, MSCs expressed higher levels of IL-6 and HGF compared to FLT3L. Under IFN-γ treatment, MSCs expressed higher levels of IL-6 compared to FLT3L (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>). Blocking either IL-6 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>) or HGF (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>) had no effect on the progress that MSCs significantly up-regulated the number of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in vitro (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>). Therefore, we might basically rule out the contribution of IL-6 and HGF on MSCs to promote the up-regulation of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs.</p><p id="Par28">Dendritic cells can be divided into pDCs, CD141<sup>+</sup>DCs and CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs, all with different functions. Therefore, we further investigated the changes of pDCs and CD141<sup>+</sup>DCs after MSCs treatment. No significant changes of absolute numbers and percentages of pDCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>) or CD141<sup>+</sup>DCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>) were observed after MSCs treatment both in vivo and in vitro. These results might further indicate that, rather than other DC subsets, the function of MSCs treatment on the alteration of DCs in lupus patients mainly focused on CD1c<sup>+</sup>DC subtype; therefore, combining the previous results shown in the manuscript, there seemed to be more evidence to prove the causative connection between MSCs treatment and the improvement of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs.</p><p id="Par29">For the 145 SLE patients included in this study who donated blood for the cell culture and flow cytometry experiments, one patient was newly onset SLE without any medication, the other 144 patients underwent steroid therapy, and 96 underwent immunosuppressant therapy including cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, azathioprine, leflunomide, tacrolimus, etc. The potential influence of these medications on tolerogenic DCs should be taken into consideration. First, we excluded the possibility that the decrease of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in SLE patients was associated with medications. It is reported that glucocorticoids have been widely used to promote tolerogenic DCs development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Also, studies based on the generation of tolerogenic DCs have used glucocorticoids to develop new immunotherapies for SLE patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In addition, several immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and leflunomide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, have been shown to affect DCs function and result in the inability of DCs to establish effective immune responses, thereby strengthening the tolerogenic circuit. Although the medications taken by patients could increase tolerogenic DCs, the tolerogenic CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs of SLE were observed to be lower than that of controls in this study, which further confirmed that the level of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs were significantly decreased in SLE. Second, the contribution of MSCs to the increase of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs should be compared with that of medications. As CD1c<sup>+</sup>DC significantly increased 24 h after U-MSCT, and the medication kept the same during this period, we could basically ruled out the contribution of the medication to the increase of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs. Furthermore, 10 SLE patients with lupus nephritis were included, who achieved partial remission after immunosuppressive medications treatment for 1 month. No significant changes of absolute numbers and percentages of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs were observed after the treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>), indicating that the mechanism of traditional immunosuppression drugs in successfully treating lupus nephritis might not be associated with the number change of CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs. This finding was slightly different from previous literature reporting that the immunosuppressive drugs could increase tolerogenic DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The contradictory results may be due to several factors including: (1) Most previous studies were in vitro experiment; (2) No previous studies have focused on the changes of CD1c<sup>+</sup> DCs.</p><p id="Par30">In summary, we uncovered that CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs as critical orchestrators of an immunoregulatory cell network in patients with SLE. We have revealed a previously unrecognized IFNγ-FLT3L-FLT3 axis in allogeneic UC-MSCs-mediated increase in CD1c<sup>+</sup>DCs in lupus patients. The findings should have implications for MSC therapeutic applications in SLE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par31">Totally, 166 SLE patients and 78 healthy subjects were included in this study.

Proteins were run on 10% gradient gel (BioRad) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Antibodies for immunoblotting were as follows: p-Stat1 (monoclonal rabbit, Abcam), Stat1 (monoclonal rabbit, Abcam), p-Stat3 (monoclonal rabbit, Abcam), Stat3 (monoclonal rabbit, Abcam), p-Stat5 (monoclonal rabbit, Abcam), Stat5 (monoclonal rabbit, Abcam), FLT3L (monoclonal rabbit, Abcam), GAPDH (monoclonal rabbit, CST). Images were captured and analyzed on Tanon−5200 Chemiluminescent Imaging System. Total density of each protein band was determined with ImageJ software. For each sample, the ratio of target protein to GAPDH total density was calculated.
