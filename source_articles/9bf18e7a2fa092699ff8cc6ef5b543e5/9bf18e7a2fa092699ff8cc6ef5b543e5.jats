Solid fraction of digestate from anaerobic digestion is a well-known N-rich substrate, most often composted in large and small agro-industrial plants. Co-composting biochar and digestate has the potential to synergistically increase the agronomic value of both components: however, it needs further process and on-field research. The present research work reports on the experimental tests on producing biochar and co-composting various biochar amounts with digestate from biomass anaerobic digestion (product here named COMBI). Biochar was produced by feeding wood chips from chestnut to an innovative oxidative reactor. In order to evaluate the quality of the products obtained by composting and co-composting, correlating this with the final biochar rate in the material, the net organic matter yield, the humified organic matter, the compliance with the European Compost Network Quality Assurance Scheme (ECN-QAS) limits for inorganic pollutants, and the product stabilization and sanitization indexes were investigated. The 11.2% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b. biochar rate in the initial blend (19.8% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b final concentration in the co-composted products) offered the best performances and is recommended for further investigation. Additional benefits from co-composting were also assessed, as the reduced dust load that favors safety and health during logistics and use.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Biochar</kwd><kwd>Compost</kwd><kwd>Digestate</kwd><kwd>Co-composting</kwd><kwd>Soil amendment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">789562</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13399_2019_Article_482.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13399-019-00482-6" ext-link-type="doi">https://doi.org/10.1007/s13399-019-00482-6</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Sustainable production of biomethane is a key option to substitute conventional natural gas and decarbonize the energy system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]: anaerobic digestion (AD) is the leading route to generate biogas, which can then be further upgraded to biomethane by CH4 separation. Today, the AD process is a well-mature process, bringing environmental and social benefits at both local and global level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]: the main co-product of biomass anaerobic digestion is a sludge (digestate), which can be applied to soil for agronomic purposes as an organic amendment. Composting is another well-known pathway to stabilize organic matter of various origins through a bio-oxidative process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which brings benefits as volume reduction, sanitization from pathogens, reduction of liquid contaminants, and economic and environmental returns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In anaerobic digestion plants, the composting stage of the solid fraction of digestate generally occupies large volumes and requires long residence time, in addition to complex logistical steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The addition of a bulking agent in the compost pile is normally recommended, in particular when substrates as digestates are used. The small particle size of the material generates risks of anaerobic conditions within the pile, leading to the production of undesired phenomena as ammonia volatilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Biochar is the solid product from lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis, characterized by a high content of stable C, mostly produced through slow pyrolysis. Biochars from intermediate/fast pyrolysis and gasification are often discussed in literature, even if these show different characteristics. Biochar is a highly porous material with a wide range of possible uses, including sustainable agriculture, as it improves the water-holding capacity and the organic matter content in soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This feature is particularly interesting in marginal lands and regions where rain is scarce, and irrigation is difficult for a number of environmental or economic reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Co-composting of organic matter and biochar, if compared to conventional composting, can positively affect the composting residence time, reducing both N-compound losses in the atmosphere and leaching, favoring the microbiological activity and in turn increasing the humification process, eliminating or reducing the need for additional bulking agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Biochar, alone or co-composted, also contributes to long-term atmospheric C sequestration in soil, offering a rather low-complexity solution if compared to most of the available C sequestering state-of-the-art technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Sanchez-Monedero et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] reviewed biochar applications to composting, suggesting application rates at the beginning of the co-composting process: the proposed rate was approximately equal to 10% by weight on dry basis of the composting pile.

All windrows were prepared for the test at the same time and in the same environment by the same operators; samples for analysis were taken at day 0 and day 60. Windrows dimensions were approximately 2 m (length) × 1.6 m (width) × 0.8 m (height), creating a pile of about 1.5 m<sup>3</sup> of volume with a vertical section as similar as possible to a semicircular shape. Windrows were prepared starting from a first layer of digestate and finishing them with digestate covering the entire pile. Biochar and straw layers were separated by digestate layers. At the end of the windrows preparation, all piles accounted for the same volume. This layer configuration lasted until the first turning, which occurred after a week. Temperatures were collected before windrow turning by positioning three probes in each pile at one-third of the vertical section from the soil and at one fourth, half, and three-fourths of the horizontal section. Ambient temperature and humidity were not recorded inside the greenhouse due to practical constraints. However, in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> (online resource), the average daily temperature and relative humidity of Scandicci (Florence, Italy) are reported, taking data from the meteorological station managed by SIR (Servizio Idrologico della Regione Toscana), an organizational unit of the Tuscany Region. Daily average temperature and daily average relative humidity values are compared to CD and CB2 average windrow temperature. The daily average values of temperature and relative humidity at the meteorological station can be a good approximation of those at the greenhouse, because of their physical proximity (Scandicci, Florence, Italy), and the greenhouse itself can be considered as an open tunnel (as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Farm-scale co-composting site—windrows and piles</p></caption><p><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2019_482_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></p></fig></p><p id="Par16">Four different blends were considered for composting, one for each windrow. The rates of biochar were increased from 0 to 15.2% by weight on dry basis, for the reasons explained below related to field rate application.

The windrows were named CD (digestate and straw only) CB1 (digestate, straw and 12 kg w.b. of biochar), CB2 (digestate, straw and 18 kg w.b. of biochar), and CB3 (digestate, straw and 24 kg w.b. of biochar), as detailed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The 18 kg w.b. rate of biochar was selected for CB2, as it corresponds to an application rate of 3 t ha<sup>−1</sup> w.b. of biochar for the case of agronomic field trials in 60-m<sup>2</sup> plots. The 12-kg w.b. and 24-kg w.b. rate of biochar for CB1 and CB3, respectively, were used to investigate the effects of different doses of biochar in windrows.

All blends remained below the 0.16 limit for the NH<sub>4</sub>-N/NO<sub>3</sub>-N ratio, with CB2 and CB3 giving the lowest values.<table-wrap id="Tab7"><label>Table 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Product quality direct comparison: nitrogen compounds (NH<sub>4</sub>-N/NO<sub>3</sub>-N ratio) in COMBI blends and digestate</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Parameter</p></th><th><p>U.M.</p></th><th><p>CD</p></th><th><p>CB1</p></th><th><p>CB2</p></th><th><p>CB3</p></th><th><p>Method</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Total N</p></td><td><p>% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b.</p></td><td><p>4.2</p></td><td><p>2.8</p></td><td><p>2.7</p></td><td><p>2.4</p></td><td><p>ANPA 13 Man 3 2001</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Organic-N/total N</p></td><td><p>%</p></td><td><p>99.15</p></td><td><p>99.65</p></td><td><p>99.55</p></td><td><p>99.63</p></td><td><p>ANPA 14 Man 3 2001</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nitrate-N</p></td><td><p>% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b.</p></td><td><p>0.280</p></td><td><p>0.100</p></td><td><p>0.180</p></td><td><p>0.130</p></td><td><p>EPA 300.11997</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ammonium-N</p></td><td><p>% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b.</p></td><td><p>0.036</p></td><td><p>0.010</p></td><td><p>0.012</p></td><td><p>0.010</p></td><td><p>ANPA 14 Man 3 2001</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NH<sub>4</sub>-N/NO<sub>3</sub>-N ratio</p></td><td/><td><p>0.129</p></td><td><p>0.100</p></td><td><p>0.067</p></td><td><p>0.077</p></td><td><p>–</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>C/N</p></td><td/><td><p>9.55</p></td><td><p>15.99</p></td><td><p>16.80</p></td><td><p>21.08</p></td><td><p>–</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par34">A summary of COMBI characteristics compared to the composted digestate is given in Table <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>; the main parameters chosen to evaluate the quality of the materials produced by composting and co-composting were the final biochar rate, the NOM yield, the humified organic matter, the compliance with the ECN-QAS limits for inorganic pollutants, and the product stabilization and sanitization indexes.<table-wrap id="Tab8"><label>Table 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Product quality comparison: all the results obtained summarized</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Parameter</p></th><th><p>CD</p></th><th><p>CB1</p></th><th><p>CB2</p></th><th><p>CB3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Final biochar rate % <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b.</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>14.9</p></td><td><p>19.8</p></td><td><p>22.8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Reduction of processing time</p></td><td><p>Control</p></td><td><p>No reduction</p></td><td><p>~ 4 days</p></td><td><p>~ 4 days</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sanitization (10 days over 55 °C)</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>No</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pathogens contamination</p></td><td><p>No</p></td><td><p>No</p></td><td><p>No</p></td><td><p><italic>E. coli</italic></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ECN-QAS limit observance</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Net organic matter yield %</p></td><td><p>38.5</p></td><td><p>41.8</p></td><td><p>47.1</p></td><td><p>56.3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>PDRI mg O<sub>2</sub> kg<sub>OM</sub><sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> (&lt; 300)</p></td><td><p>&lt; 300</p></td><td><p>350</p></td><td><p>&lt; 200</p></td><td><p>&lt; 200</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Humification Index (HI) (&gt; 3.5%)</p></td><td><p>4.0</p></td><td><p>3.6</p></td><td><p>20.0</p></td><td><p>13.2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Polymerization index (PI) (&gt; 1.0%)</p></td><td><p>2.4</p></td><td><p>2.6</p></td><td><p>3.0</p></td><td><p>0.4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NH<sub>4</sub>-N % <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b.

The control (CD) was prepared by composting solid digestate only with straw; CB2 blend was prepared considering a field application of 3 t ha<sup>−1</sup>, while CB1 and CB3 blends were prepared with a ± 30% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> w.b. respect to the initial biochar content in CB2.</p><p id="Par36">The experimental work led to a biochar concentration in the final product of 14.9, 19.8, 22.8% <italic>w</italic>/w d.b. The difficulty in estimating the final biochar concentration by weight on dry basis during COMBI production was an outcome of the production run. Indeed, when COMBI is directly produced in field conditions, the uncertainties in measuring the moisture content of different samples of the solid fraction of digestate influence the mass yield prediction, which is also dependent on local climatic conditions.</p><p id="Par37">The composting process was carried out with a biochar concentration in the initial blend of at least 11.2% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b.; CB2 and CB3 ended the bio-oxidative phase about 4 days earlier than CD and CB1. At the same time, biochar addition did not increase the peak temperature of the co-composting process, as also reported in literature. The process parameter condition (10 days over 55 °C) to guarantee the sanitization, indeed, was obtained only for CD and CB2. However, as regards a potential contamination by pathogens, only CB3 resulted with a <italic>E. coli</italic> proliferation (10<sup>4</sup> UFC g<sup>−1</sup>).</p><p id="Par38">The compost obtained from the control (CD) met all main reference limits, but products characteristics, in terms of a quantitative comparison with CB2, were always lower, in particular, regarding the product stabilization obtained.</p><p id="Par39">CB2 blend, having an initial biochar concentration of 11.2% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b., attained a final concentration of 19.8% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b.: it outperformed the other blends on all process and product parameters, showing the lowest stabilization time, the highest NOM yield with the highest degree of humification, and the lowest ammonium/nitrate ratio index. This result suggests that the 11.2% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> d.b. initial rate of biochar in the blend maximized the synergistic effect of co-composting the solid fraction of digestate with biochar. In field conditions, especially at larger scale of composting operations (e.g., anaerobic digestion plants), this rate should be further screened to increase process efficiency.</p><p id="Par40">Furthermore, it can be speculated that, if applied to soil as an amendment, CB2 could outperform the other blends in terms of OM increase in soil, considering its humification rate; however, this has to be further investigated in agronomic field trials. Stability of the recalcitrant carbon contained in biochar can also contribute to the carbon sink of soil for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p id="Par41">A qualitative result of the experiment which should be highlighted is dust reduction in biochar: after mixing the windrows, the typical black dust that normally develops when handling biochar, could not be visually observed. This represents a tremendous advantage in terms of logistics, handling, health, and safety of biochar, when it is transported, stored and applied to fields.</p><p id="Par42">The results from the present work suggests that the role of biochar in co-composting of digestate is relevant and consistent with literature for other organic substrates. In particular, considering carrying out the operations in field conditions of an anaerobic digestion plant, it is important to underline the benefit observed regarding the time reduction needed by the process, also corresponding to a product with better characteristics than without biochar addition.</p><p id="Par43">Two of the main parameters investigated for COMBI characterization were the biochar rate and the NOM content. An application rate based on weight per hectare on wet basis could be misleading due to the possible uncertainties in sample collection and representativity, as regards the moisture content. The adoption of a volume-based approach, instead, allows for a better evaluation of the actual biochar application rate per hectare.</p><p id="Par44">Further research on the co-composting of biochar and digestate could include mass balance of nitrogen and carbon through measuring of gaseous emissions from windrows, to establish also greenhouse gas emissions of the process. The use of lysimeters is thus recommended for the scope. Since C/N ratio normally used in agriculture is difficult to apply to co-composted blends with biochar for agronomic application, further investigation on water-soluble C/N of the final product is suggested.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding information</title><p>This project received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement BIO4A-No 789562.
