The moth has spread to a wide range of regions in Chile from the Atacama region to the Araucanía region, causing disease in grapes (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) and other plant hosts such as blueberry (<italic>Vaccinium corymbosum</italic>) and plum (<italic>Prunus domestica</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The primary damage caused by this species occurs through larval feeding on berries, dehydration of tissue and fruit rotting, which leads to a subsequent round of fungal diseases such as grape mold (<italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Currently, farmers have achieved effective chemical control and mating disruption of this pest, but reinfection of vineyards is caused by small urban outbreaks that are not controlled. Additionally, climate change contributes to shortening of its reproductive cycles and leads to appropriate conditions for new outbreaks within a season. As an alternative to reduce pesticide use to preserve our environment, health and nutrition, a goal is to use a formulation based on the entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) <italic>Beauveria pseudobassiana</italic> to control the pest in urban areas during its winter diapause.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Main text</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Biological material</title><p id="Par8">All the pupae of <italic>L. botrana</italic> used for the in vitro and field trials were obtained from the breeding project of the Entomology Laboratory of INIA La Cruz.

However, we considered it necessary to perform field trials under the temperature and humidity conditions of July. This trial reached an efficacy of 100% and was considered representative of the behavior of the fungi because under the environmental conditions and oscillations in temperature and humidity that occurred in this trial.</p><p id="Par23">On the basis of the results of the field trial, we assessed an assay conducted in urban zones during August. The primary barrier to the EPF is the cocoon, which provides natural protection against pathogens and arthropods. In this case, the efficacy reached 51% using only one application. The pupae from the urban zones showed hypha and conidia on the cocoons and between the sutures of the pupae. This result demonstrated the ability of the fungus to penetrate the cocoon and colonize the pupa (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The other treatments in which we performed two and three applications did not show significant differences (15% and 13% efficacy, respectively). In addition to the decrease in efficacy caused by the cocoon in all the treatments, another possible explanation for this difference is that during the first application, the EPF consumes most of the carbon sources and proteins from the pupae and the formulation, but after seven dpa, opportunistic fungi such as <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. and <italic>Rhizopus</italic> sp<italic>.</italic> begin to appear (observations of urban samples). These fungi may have taken advantage of the components of the formulation and reduce the efficacy of the product.</p><p id="Par24">In conclusion, we achieved an efficiency of 51% with one application of EPF formulation in urban areas to control the pest during its winter diapause. Additionally, the formulation is useful in fruit crops because pollinators and antifungal chemical applications are not encountered in the field. Finally, possible annual applications in urban and rural zones contribute to the control of <italic>L. botrana</italic> in the country in combination with other IPM strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par25">To improve the formulation, it will be necessary to examine its components and different concentrations thereof to increase their efficacy. We will need to perform a series of urban trials over time to optimize the use of the EPF.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge the farmers, urban residents and the National Program of <italic>Lobesia botrana</italic>, SAG.
