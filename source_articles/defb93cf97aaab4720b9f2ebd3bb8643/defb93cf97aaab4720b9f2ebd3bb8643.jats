To eliminate storage and year effects, frozen F<sub>6</sub>, F<sub>10</sub>, F<sub>11</sub> and F<sub>15</sub> seeds were multiplied in one field, resulting in the respective F<sub>x.1</sub> generations. This eliminated generation and growing system effects on seed size for the F<sub>6.1</sub> F<sub>10.1</sub> and F<sub>15.1.</sub> Due to a severe winter kill affecting the F<sub>11</sub>, the generation effect persisted, leading to larger seeds and markedly different seedling traits in the F<sub>11.1</sub> compared to the F<sub>10.1</sub> and F<sub>15.1</sub>. Seedling traits were similar among parallel populations. Shoot length and weight increased in both systems until the F<sub>11.1</sub> across farming systems and remained constant thereafter. Over time<sub>,</sub> seminal root length and root weight of organic CCPs increased and total- and specific- root length decreased significantly compared to the conventional CCPs. Rooting patterns under organic conditions suggests better ability to reach deeper soil nutrients. In both systems, Q and YQ CCPs were more vigorous than Y CCPs, confirming genetic differences among populations. Overall, heterogeneous populations appear very plastic and selection pressure was stronger in organic systems.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>This research was in part funded through the German BMBF project INSUSFAR (Innovative approaches to optimize genetic diversity for sustainable farming systems of the future, Grant No: 031A350C) and by the EU H2020 project REMIX (Redesigning European cropping systems based on species MIXtures, Grant No: 727217).</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_45300.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Agriculture is facing the challenges of climate change, leading to higher variability and frequency of climatic extremes and increasing combined abiotic and biotic stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. To cope with these stresses, current farming systems are likely to require even more energy in the future (e.g. for irrigation systems and increased inputs) while facing reduced soil, water and air quality and overall system productivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. An alternative is to develop agricultural systems with an inherent capacity to adapt to environmental changes and that contribute to the protection of soil organic content and structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This requires a major rethinking of breeding methods and redesigning of farming systems. In this context, evolutionary breeding using composite crosses has been gaining attention for direct selection in a specifically targeted environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Composite cross populations (CCPs) are created by crossing a number of pure line varieties in all possible combinations. The progenies of the numerous crosses are then propagated as bulk populations under natural selection within specific farming environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Well-designed CCPs offer greater resilience to stressful and variable environments and provide for dynamic conservation of gene pools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The higher intra-crop diversity found in CCPs allows for greater capability for evolution and adaptation to local conditions and farming systems including mixed cropping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and may provide for a better response to continuously changing climatic conditions, pests and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. As such, increased within-field variation and within-crop diversity can reduce the effects of larger environmental variability, on the one hand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. On the other hand, CCPs could effectively contribute to soil improvement via diverse organic residues and rhizodeposits. Thus, plant genotypes play a role “as a determinant of the species and genetic composition of the saprophytic microbial community resident to the rhizosphere”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Specifically, wheat genotypes vary in their effects on microbial community composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, CCPs should help increase microbial community diversity in the rhizosphere and by this farming system sustainability.</p><p id="Par4">For successful organic cereal production, early vigour is of major importance to improve nutrient-use efficiency and weed competitive ability. Vigour may simply be described as rapid root and shoot growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Seminal roots developing directly from the germinating seed are responsible for initial absorption of water and nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. They remain functionally active throughout crop growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and are also involved in the plastic response to growing environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, fast shoot growth increases crop competitiveness to weeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Exploring the strategies of plant seminal root system modification to acquire soil resources potentially allows for estimation of generative plant growth and yielding ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, which in turn can assist in developing varieties with desired root traits for a particular environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Simulation studies have shown that deeper root systems are more likely to provide yield benefits in conditions where nutrients and water are scarce and heterogeneously-distributed within the soil matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Assessing root-related features on a large number of plants over various genotypes <italic>in-situ</italic> is, however, tedious and technically challenging. As an alternative, artificial techniques like hydroponics provide a sensitive way to study early root characteristics under controlled conditions, and the results can be correlated with root development <italic>in-situ</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In 2001, three winter wheat CCPs were created at the John Innes Centre (Norwich, UK) in co-operation with the Elm-Farm Research Centre (Newbury, UK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In autumn 2005, F<sub>4</sub> seeds of all three CCPs were received by the University of Kassel, Germany. At the University of Kassel, each CCP was maintained under differing organic and conventional farming systems in 2005/06 (F<sub>5</sub>). Since the F<sub>6</sub> (2006/07), each CCP was split into two parallel populations (I and II) within each farming system to determine the changes of the CCPs within the system and between systems. Populations were maintained in separated plots of &gt;150 m<sup>2</sup> in order to maintain an effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>) large enough to ensure genetic conservation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Morphological and agronomic studies with these CCPs (F<sub>5</sub> - F<sub>15</sub>) revealed that genetic variability is still high in the CCPs, even after 11 generations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and unpublished molecular analyses by our laboratory confirm continuous recombination events in the populations. This allows for changes in their genetic make-up over time through selection and recombination and enables adaptation to their growing conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The CCPs (F<sub>11</sub>) showed yield resilience in the face of a severe bare frost event in February 2012 that killed most parental varieties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Yield stability of the organically grown CCPs was higher than for genetically uniform varieties under organic conditions, but not necessarily under conventional conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In addition, in conditions of water-stress or drought the CCPs (F<sub>14</sub>, 2014/15) have out-yielded modern cultivars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The first indication of divergent evolution between organic and conventional CCPs for early vigour traits was shown by Bertholdsson <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> comparing seedlings of the F<sub>6</sub> and F<sub>11</sub> in a hydroponic system. The authors found differences in vigour traits due to the differing genetic composition of the CCPs, and due to organic and conventional farming systems. However, they used seeds that had been stored frozen for various lengths of time. The F<sub>6</sub> was harvested in 2007 and had been stored frozen at −20 °C for 6 years, while the F<sub>11</sub> (harvested 2012) was relatively fresh at the time of their experiment. In addition, there was a large difference in growing conditions, because the organic and conventional CCPs had been maintained in separate fields with variable soil quality. Furthermore, the effects of the winter kill 2012 were very strong on the CCPs of the F<sub>11,</sub> and we later found that the legacy effect was carried over to the next generation (F<sub>12</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Preliminary molecular analyses also confirmed changes in allele composition in the CCPs in the F<sub>11</sub> as a result of the winter kill (unpublished).</p><p id="Par7">By the F<sub>15</sub>, seeds stored frozen for 0 up to 10 years and grown under yearly changing weather conditions were available. Long-term seed storage influences seed vitality and, together with environmental differences during plant growth, may have implications for early vigour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">To eliminate the effects of storage time, soil, and environmental conditions, seeds of the organic and conventional CCPs of the F<sub>6</sub>, F<sub>10</sub>, (before winter kill) F<sub>11</sub> (after winter kill) and F<sub>15</sub> were multiplied for one year in a common field under the same management system, and early vigour traits of the ensuing fresh and stored seeds were compared using the same hydroponic system as used by Bertholdsson <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. with the F<sub>6</sub> and F<sub>11</sub> before. This study comprises both methodical and fundamental aspects. In the first, methodical part, the following questions were addressed: (a) To which extent may the result of comparative analysis based on stored seeds harvested in different years and environments be biased by differences in seed size, germinability and early seedling vigour? (b) Does one year seed increase under identical conditions eliminate the system and year effects, and to which extent? In the second part, the effects of parental genetics and farming system over time on the early vigour of the wheat CCPs were assessed.

This suggests that the organic farming system favoured the production of larger seeds. Seed size heritability is low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and variation in seed size tends to be a result of phenotypic plasticity, which is thought to be adaptive, especially as the result of environmental variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Seed multiplication under identical conditions, however, did not eliminate the year effects in the F<sub>11.1,</sub> grown from the F<sub>11</sub> that had been exposed to an exceptional frost event<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, carryover effects of the frost event in 2011/12 persisted for at least one additional year. Nevertheless, the large genetic variability in the CCPs effectively overcame this one-off climatic stress, as there were no more signs of frost effects on the seed size nor on early seedling traits in the F<sub>15.1</sub> (after frost event) and their trends were similar to that of F<sub>10.1</sub> (before frost event)<sub>.</sub> The frost event seriously reduced the effective population size for one year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and preliminary molecular analyses suggest that the changes due to frost disappeared within two years (unpublished).

However, CY I in particular, showed a different trajectory for all the measured seedling traits in every generation, compared to CY II, indicating that the CY I is more reactive to the growing systems than all other conventional CCPs and it seems less stable, compared to CY II. These results also suggest that the two conventional Y CCPs may have undertaken divergent evolution over time. This supports observations of divergent trajectories in the conventional Y CCPs by Weedon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> who compared the agronomic performance of all 12 CCPs across eleven generations (F<sub>5</sub> - F<sub>15</sub>). In general, variations among populations and between generations are attributed mainly to environmental stress, plant-plant competition and plant-pathogen co-evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The populations were all grown within less than 100 m from each other in each year and we have no explanation as to why the CY I and CY II populations diverge.</p><p id="Par30">Root systems and their adjustments are considered as a key aspect of a plant’s phenotypic plasticity in response to its growing conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Phenotypic plasticity, however, could itself be under genetic control and thus subjected to selective pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Diverse populations like CCPs could respond to variable growing environments by becoming both more plastic and genetically variable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The CCPs exposed to differing organic and conventional growing conditions were able to produce significantly higher root dry weight in the organic CCPs after only one generation of maintenance, demonstrating great plasticity and adaptability. Clear farming systems effects were observed both after four years (F<sub>10.1</sub>) and after nine years (F<sub>15.1</sub>), where seminal root length and root dry weight significantly increased in the organic CCPs in comparison to the conventional ones.</p><p id="Par31">The other key feature of root adjustments between organic and conventional CCPs were the changes related to the total root length and specific root length. Total root length affects the distribution of roots in the soil profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, whereas specific root length indicates root length for a given root mass, and is a key indicator of root thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Generally, finest roots, with diameter 0 to 0.25 mm and thinner or finer roots, with diameter 0.25 to 0.5 mm account for a substantial portion of the total root length and total root surface area. For crops under conventional systems, early vigour may not be that important, and as such investment in shallow roots is relatively cheap as mineral nitrogen is easily accessible in the topsoil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In our study, conventional CCPs in all the years had a high specific root length as a result of greater total root length and lower root dry weights. Root systems of this kind have a lower soil penetrating ability and a fast growth rate leading to quick loss of nutrients and incomplete exploration of deeper soil resources, as a result of adaptation to high rates of mineral nitrogen. In contrast, investment in expensive long-lived roots with slower metabolic rates is critical to organic farming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. This can be substantiated by our study, where the CCPs exposed to organic growing systems had very different rooting patterns over time. Longer seminal roots and a very low specific root length as a result of decreased total root length and higher root dry weights of the organic CCPs indicate longer, thicker, heavier and steeper main root systems. These traits may bring the crop root systems into greater contact with deeper soil layers with heterogeneous conditions of low nutrient supply, and where mineralization of organic materials is rather slow, due to low soil temperatures in spring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. These root features may also be optimal to invest in a relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for indirect nutrient uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. When comparing to either organically-bred or conventionally-bred varieties, we found that the three organic CCPs of the F<sub>15.1</sub> clearly stood out with lower specific root lengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. This suggests that adaptive processes within the organic CCPs have led to very specific changes that have not been achieved so far by breeding for organic farming systems using the conventional line breeding approach.</p><p id="Par32">Root growth positively influences shoot growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and as such, fast shoot growth in conditions where no herbicides are allowed can improve canopy formation and biomass production by exploiting available solar radiation, which in turn exerts greater weed competitive ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In addition, net primary productivity is increased, further enhancing the translocation flow of assimilates to the roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. These observed root traits on young plants may regulate the architecture of the plant systems at the adult crop stages, improving yielding ability in the organic systems. Greater seedling vigour in root and shoot growth enhances nitrogen uptake in wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, and rooting depth of winter wheat genotypes improves nitrogen uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Overall, heterogeneous populations appear very plastic and show an apparent adaptation to local growing environments.</p><p id="Par33">The differences on root vigour observed between OY and CY show that they respond very differently to the farming systems that they were grown in. From the F<sub>6.1</sub> to the F<sub>15.1</sub>, both organic and conventional CCPs produced for yield had lower early vigour than the Q and YQ CCPs indicating genetic effects of the parents on the performance of the CCPs. This also highlights that there is genetic variation for nutrient-use efficiency (i.e. utilizing available nutrients from soil or fertilizers more effectively) within the CCPs confirming the results of Bertholdsson <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The interaction with the growing system highlights that CCPs are capable of adapting to differing farming systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The tendency of the Q and YQ populations of the organic system towards greater vigour in root growth in comparison to the Q and YQ populations of the conventional system was further supported by field observations comparing the organic CCPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. It is, however, difficult to decide whether the observed differences are transitory or long-lasting. Generally, weather conditions were the same for each population in each generation, but site-specific environmental conditions varied such as soil quality (specifically challenging for the conventional CCPs until F<sub>12</sub>), disease loads and nutrient availability that might have affected the populations over time.</p><p id="Par34">Despite seed increase under the same conditions, the dramatic effects of the extreme frost event on the CCPs of the F<sub>11</sub> were carried through to the fresh seeds of F<sub>11.1.</sub> Only in the F<sub>11.1</sub>, were there no system differences for root traits that were very prominent in the other three generations. An overriding effect of the frost event was a very low ratio of root to shoot weights or nutrient uptake rates per unit mass. Such conditions with proportionately higher shoot growth than root growth, especially at an early stage may result in poor anchorage and suboptimal acquisition of soil resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, which in turn leads to inferior crop structure with a sparse canopy, limiting successional crop developmental stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. It is, therefore, not so surprising that the frost affected changes in root traits seem magnified in the organic CCPs, in which SRL was increased by the F<sub>10.1</sub>. In contrast, the conventional CCPs apparently invested more in above than below ground biomass with little changes in root traits. Nevertheless, this one-off climatic event did not change the entire genetic makeup of the populations, as evidenced by the again improved early root vigour in the organic F<sub>15.1</sub> (four years after the frost event) with trends were similar to the F<sub>10.1</sub> (before the frost event)<sub>.</sub></p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par35">This study highlights that wheat seeds stored for &gt;5 years appear unsuitable for directly studying important seedling traits.

The only exception were the two conventional Y populations that apparently have experienced separate random events in an early generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Selection pressure was overall stronger in organic farming systems. The evolutionary changes of organic CCPs over time resulted mainly in longer, thicker and a deeper main root systems that may be better adapted to conditions of limited nutrient supply that usually prevail from fall to late spring under organic management. In contrast, under conventional management, very little or no changes were evident. The differences between CCPs created from the Y or Q parents or the YQ intercross demonstrate the clear genetic effects of the parents on the performance of the CCPs Overall, the ability of CCPs to adapt their seedling characteristics, particularly when grown under an organic system, and their ability to buffer a single extreme climatic event demonstrate the high degree of resilience of the CCPs. Thus, CCPs as such, provide a useful breeding base for specifically targeted environments for improved agricultural production. In addition, however, when used as populations, resilience may be further enhanced by the fact that there is a moderate degree of heterosis within the CCPs that may lead to superior performance of newly crossed individuals enhancing the CCP performance. Hydroponics offers a cost efficient, quick, and thorough tool for root measurements that highly correlate with the results of field experiments, making it a valuable selection tool for breeders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par37">The wheat composite cross populations (CCPs) were created in 2001 by The Organic Research Centre, Elm farm and the John Innes Institute in the UK through a complete half-diallel cross of twenty wheat varieties.
