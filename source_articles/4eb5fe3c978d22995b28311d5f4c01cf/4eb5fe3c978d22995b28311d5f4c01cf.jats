However, arrays remain difficult to generate due to their reoccurring repeat sequences. Here, we report a modular, one-pot scheme called CRATES to construct CRISPR arrays and array libraries. CRATES allows assembly of repeat-spacer subunits using defined assembly junctions within the trimmed portion of spacers. Using CRATES, we construct arrays for the single-effector nucleases Cas9, Cas12a, and Cas13a that mediated multiplexed DNA/RNA cleavage and gene regulation in cell-free systems, bacteria, and yeast. CRATES further allows the one-pot construction of array libraries and composite arrays utilized by multiple Cas nucleases. Finally, array characterization reveals processing of extraneous CRISPR RNAs from Cas12a terminal repeats and sequence- and context-dependent loss of RNA-directed nuclease activity via global RNA structure formation. CRATES thus can facilitate diverse multiplexing applications and help identify factors impacting crRNA biogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">CRISPR array generation is difficult due to reoccurring repeat sequences.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">CRISPR-Cas systems represent RNA-directed immune systems whose programmable nucleases have become powerful tools for genome editing, gene regulation, imaging, and diagnostics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. One unique feature of the immune systems is their inherent ability to multiplex through CRISPR arrays. Arrays comprise alternating conserved ~36-bp repeats and invader-derived ~30-bp spacers that are transcribed into precursor CRISPR RNAs (pre-crRNAs) and processed into individual CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) (also generally called guide RNAs). Each crRNA then directs the nuclease to bind and cleave nucleic-acid targets complementary to the spacer and flanked by short defined sequences such as protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. As each crRNA would direct the nuclease to a distinct target, a single CRISPR array can orchestrate the simultaneous targeting of multiple sequences.</p><p id="Par4">The multiplexing capacity of CRISPR arrays was well recognized before the advent of CRISPR technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, yet multiplexing efforts originally revolved around engineered single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) utilized by the Type II Cas9 nuclease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These sgRNAs circumvented the need for either a tracrRNA or RNase III that both participate in crRNA biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, thereby allowing DNA targeting with only an sgRNA and Cas9. However, because an sgRNA represents the final version of the crRNA, multiplexing with a single DNA construct has instead required workarounds such as expressing individual sgRNAs from separate promoters or joining sgRNAs with intervening cleavage domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The more recent discovery that Type V Cas12a and Type VI Cas13 single-effector nucleases can process CRISPR arrays without accessory factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> renewed interest in synthetic CRISPR arrays and led to recent examples of using arrays for multiplexed genome editing and gene regulation in bacteria and eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. CRISPR arrays further offer notable advantages over sgRNA arrays, including compatibility with any CRISPR nuclease and repeat-spacer subunits that are much smaller (~66 bp) than those typically used in sgRNA arrays (~150–400 bp). CRISPR arrays thus hold widespread potential for multiplexing applications, including enhanced gene drives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, coordinate regulation of metabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, predictable gene deletions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, proximal CRISPR targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, multi-pathogen antimicrobials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, multiplexed base editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, combinatorial nucleic-acid sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and combinatorial screens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Despite their desirable features, CRISPR arrays remain to be widely adopted. A prevailing reason has been the challenge of efficiently generating arrays. For instance, groups could request commercial vendors to chemically synthesize arrays as linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) gene fragments, although the reoccuring repeats inherent to the arrays currently interfere with fragment construction. Separately, many established assembly techniques have been developed for sgRNA arrays, with Golden-Gate assembly the most common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, although none of the techniques have been extended to CRISPR arrays. Instead, the few available techniques for generating CRISPR arrays involve annealing shorter oligonucleotides into repeat-spacer subunits and using overhangs at the ends of each subunit to form the intervening assembly junctions (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. While these techniques have been used to assemble a handful of individual arrays harboring two to four spacers, they require multiple assembly steps or rely on overhangs derived from the existing repeat or spacer sequences. The lack of flexibility in selecting assembly junctions in particular heavily restrains the generation of large arrays or array libraries. What is needed is a strategy for assembling CRISPR arrays that can be performed in one pot and decouples the overhangs from the selected repeat and spacer sequences.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we address this challenge through the development of CRATES (<underline>CR</underline>ISPR <underline>A</underline>ssembly through <underline>T</underline>rimmed <underline>E</underline>nds of <underline>S</underline>pacers), a modular, one-pot assembly scheme for CRISPR arrays. CRATES takes advantage of the portion of crRNA spacers that does not participate in target recognition and often undergoes trimming as part of crRNA biogenesis for single-effector Cas nucleases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. By introducing a defined assembly junction into this region, compatible overhangs can be selected that are fully decoupled from the targeting portion of the spacer and the conserved repeat. We show that this strategy allowed the efficient construction of larger arrays, a 125-member library of three-spacer arrays, and composite arrays utilized by multiple nucleases. We also use the assembled arrays to elucidate factors relevant to the design of synthetic arrays and the evolution of naturally occurring arrays, including native terminal repeats in Cas12a arrays preventing the generation of an extraneous yet functional crRNA, and the contribution of global secondary structure to crRNA abundance and crRNA-directed nuclease activity. In total, CRATES is expected to streamline multiplexing with numerous CRISPR single-effector nucleases and facilitate the interrogation of the processing, function, and evolution of CRISPR arrays.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CRATES is a one-pot assembly scheme for CRISPR arrays</title><p id="Par7">We began with the Cas12a nuclease from <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> U112 (FnCas12a), whose crRNA spacers are known to undergo trimming at its 3′ end from 30 nts in the transcribed array to ~23 nts in the processed crRNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, recent crystal structures of the FnCas12a:crRNA ribonucleoprotein complex bound to target DNA showed that only the first 20 nts of the guide portion of the crRNA participated in target hybridization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. These insights led us to hypothesize that overhangs for the assembly of repeat-spacer subunits could be placed at the 3′ end of each spacer without interfering with crRNA-directed DNA targeting—a hypothesis we confirmed based on similar plasmid clearance activities in <italic>E. coli</italic> with or without a junction sequence (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The junctions used to assemble repeat-spacer subunits parallel those used for the assembly of multiple DNA fragments by Golden-Gate Assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> with one notable difference: rather than relying on overhangs generated using Type IIS restriction enzymes, we can create junctions comprising 5′ or 3′ overhangs of any length or sequence by annealing two short, ~66-nt oligonucleotides to form each repeat-spacer subunit. We term the resulting assembly scheme CRATES for <underline>CR</underline>ISPR <underline>A</underline>ssembly through <underline>T</underline>rimmed <underline>E</underline>nds of <underline>S</underline>pacers.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A modular, one-pot assembly scheme for CRISPR-Cas12a arrays based on spacer trimming. <bold>a</bold> Processing of the transcribed CRISPR array by the Cas12a nuclease.

The construct contained a total of six components: a constitutive promoter to drive transcription of the array, two Type IIS restriction sites for inserting multiple repeat-spacer subunits at one time, a GFP reporter construct that is excised as part of array assembly, a 3′ repeat so the final array begins and ends with repeats, and a terminator to halt transcription of the array. Repeat-spacer subunits were designed to contain 5′ and/or 3′ overhangs with highly dissimilar sequences previously validated for efficient modular assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, thereby diminishing the frequency of misassembly. We chose 4-nt overhangs given their use with assembly techniques based on Type IIS restriction enzymes, although other overhang lengths could be tested. The repeat-spacer subunits and the base construct were then assembled into an array in a one-pot reaction that cycles between digestion of the backbone with a Type IIS restriction enzyme and ligation by T4 DNA ligase in a thermocycler. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> depicts the assembly of a three-spacer array with four distinct junctions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>CRATES enabled efficient assembly of arrays and libraries</title><p id="Par9">We first explored how well CRATES could be used to assemble individual arrays containing different numbers of spacers. We designed arrays recognized by FnCas12a with up to seven spacers containing distinct 26-nt sequences and 4-nt junctions. Following the assembly reaction and transformation into <italic>E. coli</italic>, we counted the relative number of fluorescent or non-fluorescent cells, where non-fluorescent cells lost the GFP expression construct and therefore would be expected to contain assembled arrays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). We found that the total number of transformants decreased for arrays with more spacers, in line with lower efficiencies when assembling more fragments at one time. However, non-fluorescent colonies always outnumbered fluorescent colonies by a factor between 30 and over 1000. By contrast, only fluorescent colonies were observed in the absence of any added repeat-spacer subunits. Colony PCR of five random, non-fluorescent colonies yielded the correct band size 100% of the time (5/5) for arrays containing up to five spacers and 60% of the time (3/5) for arrays with seven spacers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Colony PCR of individual colonies yielded the expected band size, while Sanger sequencing confirmed that the arrays contained the expected sequence. In the case of the two negative clones, the smaller PCR products were in line with formation of arrays with a single spacer. CRATES therefore represents a simple and efficient approach to assemble large CRISPR arrays up to and potentially exceeding seven spacers.</p><p id="Par10">Given that the junction sequences are decoupled from the targeting portion of the spacers, we asked how well CRATES could be used to generate a library of CRISPR arrays. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we designed three-spacer FnCas12a arrays with five unique spacers that could occupy each location in an array, yielding a total of 125 different arrays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). After performing the assembly reaction in two independent experiments, we plated 10 μl of each batch of recovering transformants. Out of the 251 resulting colonies between the two runs, only one colony was green (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Furthermore, colony PCR screening of random white colonies showed that 95% (18/19) of the screened colonies harbored an assembled array (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Finally, we performed next-generation sequencing to determine the identity and abundance of the arrays in one of the libraries. We found that all arrays were present at relatively uniform abundance, with a 7.4-fold ratio between the highest-abundance and lowest-abundance arrays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Deeper analysis of the relative array abundances revealed that the slight variability in abundance can be mostly attributed to a lower stoichiometry or cloning efficiency of two spacers in the 3′ location (S3k, S3o), suggesting that adjusting the levels of the corresponding repeat-spacer subunits could further narrow the distribution of array abundances in the library (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). These results therefore show that CRATES can be used to create libraries of CRISPR arrays.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>CRATES can be used to efficiently generate a library of assembled CRISPR arrays in one pot. <bold>a</bold> Cloning scheme for the CRISPR array library.

In particular, the advantage of CRATES over prior assembly techniques (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) is that the junction sequences are decoupled from the repeat sequence, allowing us to readily use other repeat sequences when constructing arrays. We began with the Cas12a nuclease from <italic>Acidaminococcus</italic> sp. BV3L6 (AsCas12a), a homolog of FnCas12a exhibiting robust editing activity in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

As part of the assay, a plasmid with a targeting or no-spacer CRISPR array was transformed into cells harboring the AsCas12a plasmid and a plasmid containing the target sequence. Successful plasmid clearance resulted in a large reduction in the number of antibiotic-resistant colonies for the targeting array versus the no-spacer array. We designed three spacers against three distinct target sequences. CRATES was then used to construct either single-spacer arrays or a three-spacer array using the conserved repeat sequence associated with AsCas12a. Performing the plasmid clearance assay, we found that the single-spacer arrays cleared only their cognate target plasmid, while the array with all three spacers cleared all target plasmids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2A</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>CRATES can be used to generate CRISPR arrays that function with different Cas single-effector nucleases. <bold>a</bold> Multiplexed plasmid clearance by AsCas12a in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Three RuvC domains have been implicated in DNA cleavage, where single point mutations completely or partially disrupted cleavage in vitro in the first two domains (D917A, E1006A) or the third domain (D1255A), respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We initially tested different combinations of the impact of thse mutations on FnCas12a using the plasmid clearance assay in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3A</xref>). All mutations disrupted plasmid clearance, indicating that mutating even the third RuvC domain of FnCas12a could disrupt cleavage in vivo. We then measured gene repression in <italic>E. coli</italic> by expressing a single-spacer array targeting the <italic>lacZ</italic> promoter upstream of <italic>gfp</italic> on a plasmid (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3A</xref>). Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis revealed that, while all combinations of mutations led to a reduction in GFP levels compared to a non-targeting control, the E1006A mutant exhibited only partial repression activity in line with a similar observation reported recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we achieved multiplexed gene repression in <italic>E. coli</italic> with the triple mutant (D917A, E1006A, D1255A) when targeting three different promoters (<italic>araB</italic>, <italic>lacZ</italic>, <italic>lacIq</italic>) controlling <italic>gfp</italic> on different plasmids (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3B</xref>). To extend these findings to eukaryotic cells, we employed the FnCas12a double mutant (D917A, E1006A) fused to the VP64 activation domain in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> in line with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> to assess multiplexed targeting of a CYC1 promoter upstream of a chromosomal copy of <italic>yegfp</italic> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3C</xref>). In line with the synergistic impact of recruiting multiple copies of VP64 to the same promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, flow cytometry analysis showed that the three-spacer arrays consistently yielded more yEGFP-expressing cells with higher fluorescence than those targeted by single-spacer arrays, but only in the presence of VP64 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3C</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">Next, we asked if CRATES could be extended to generate arrays utilized by other CRISPR single-effector nucleases, given that the associated crRNA spacers also undergo trimming and do not rely on the full spacer for target recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. We first began with the Type II Cas9 nuclease from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (SpCas9), where the associated crRNA spacers are trimmed by ~10 nts from the 5′ end and only 20 nts are necessary for DNA targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. To account for the location of the guide region in the spacer utilized by the nuclease, we modified the base assembly construct by placing the repeat upstream rather than downstream of the GFP-dropout cassette. We also encoded the tracrRNA required for crRNA processing in the Cas9 expression plasmid, and we relied on the RNase III endogenous to <italic>E. coli</italic>. As expected, the plasmid clearance assay resulted in the single-spacer arrays only clearing their cognate target plasmid and the three-spacer assay clearing each of the three target plasmids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2B</xref>). We then transitioned to the Type VI single-effector nuclease Cas13a from <italic>Leptotrichia shahii</italic> (LsCas13a). This nuclease targets RNA, where target recognition leads to LsCas13a non-specifically degrading other RNAs in the vicinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. As the crRNA spacer for LsCas13a is trimmed on the 3′ end<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, we developed a base assembly construct similar to that for Cas12a. We then devised an RNA-sensing assay using an <italic>E. coli</italic> cell-free transcription–translation (TXTL) system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, where DNA encoding LsCas13a and the constructed CRISPR array were mixed with DNA expressing a target RNA and a non-targeted GFP reporter (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4A, B</xref>). The GFP transcript would then undergo non-specific degradation only when the processed crRNA is paired with its target, resulting in curtailed production of GFP. As expected, GFP expression in the RNA-sensing assay was reduced compared to a no-spacer array only when the spacer and its cognate target were both present (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2C</xref> and 4C).

Similar to Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, we relied on RNase III endogenous to <italic>E. coli</italic> for processing of the portion of the arrays used by SpCas9. As expected, the single-spacer arrays yielded plasmid clearance or GFP repression when matched with their nuclease and targeted plasmid, while one of the four-spacer composite arrays (Pc7/8/9/10) yielded plasmid clearance or GFP repression comparable to that of all single-spacer arrays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2D</xref>). Interestingly, the other four-spacer composite array with swapped SpCas9 spacers (Pc8/7/9/10) exhibited greatly reduced plasmid clearance of one target plasmid by SpCas9, suggesting that the sequence and context of the spacers in an array can impact the resulting crRNA-directed nuclease activity.</p><p id="Par16">As a separate demonstration, we asked if composite arrays could be used to direct the blocking of off-target sites with a catalytically dead nuclease as part of genome editing with a separate, catalytically active nuclease. We chose SpyCas9 for on-target cleavage and the FnCas12a triple mutant to block off-target sites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). We further selected one of the original examples of off-target cleavage by SpCas9 in human cells, with an on-target site in WAS CR-4 (P-on) and two known off-target sites in STK25 (P-off1) and GNHR2 (P-off2) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The target sites for dFnCas12a were chosen so the R-loop would extend through the NGG PAM recognized by SpCas9, thereby presumably preventing DNA recognition. Each site was further cloned upstream of the GFP reporter construct, and TXTL was used as a rapid means to assess blocking of the off-target sites but not the on-target site by FnCas12a. We also used CRATES to assemble a variant of the composite array in which the targeting SpCas9 sgRNA was placed upstream of a two-spacer FnCas12a array (Psg/b1/b2 and Psg/b2/b1). To perform the assay, we first added the dFnCas12a plasmid and a reporter plasmid along with either one plasmid encoding a composite array or two plasmids each encoding the sgRNA and a single-spacer FnCas12a array (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5C</xref>). We then added the plasmid encoding SpCas9 and measured GFP fluorescence over time (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5D</xref>). The protection efficiency was then calculated based on the rate of GFP production in comparison to that when expressing a no-spacer FnCas12a array and the targeting sgRNA (0% protection) or a non-targeting sgRNA (100% protection). We found that both tested composite arrays inhibited cleavage by SpCas9 at both off-target sites at efficiencies similar to those when expressing the SpCas9 sgRNA and single-spacer FnCas12a arrays separately (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2E</xref>). Critically, there was minimal protection of the on-target site. These results suggest that composite arrays can be used to block off-target sites and improve on-target specificity by Cas nucleases, although more testing is needed beyond this cell-free demonstration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary structure contributes to crRNA biogenesis</title><p id="Par17">Given the ease in constructing CRISPR arrays using CRATES, we asked if the resulting arrays could shed light on crRNA biogenesis and the resulting crRNA-directed nuclease activity.

The first observation parallels RNA-seq analyses of CRISPR arrays in their natural contexts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the relative abundances trended similarly between TXTL and HEK293T cells, suggesting that the underlying mechanism was independent of the cell expression system. An ensuing question is what explains the variability in crRNA abundance. Given the importance of a characteristic hairpin within the repeat as part of crRNA processing by Cas12a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that repeats in highly structured regions lacking a formed hairpin would yield poorly abundant crRNAs. To explore this possibility, we predicted the secondary structure of the transcribed, seven-spacer FnCas12a array using NUPACK (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6A, B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In line with our hypothesis, the least abundant crRNAs (S2, S3, S4, S5) were part of highly structured regions that often disrupted the characteristic hairpin recognized by FnCas12a in each repeat. By contrast, the most-abundant crRNAs (S1, S6, S7), were generally unstructured and formed the hairpin in each repeat. Similar trends were observed for RNA-seq analysis of the native nine-spacer array from <italic>F. novicida</italic> U112 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6C, D</xref>). Spacer S7 in this native array appeared to be an exception because the hairpin of the repeat is correctly formed and the spacer is mostly unstructured; however, the prediction of a 10-bp hairpin through the 3′ end of the spacer would be expected to inhibit processing based on our recent work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. These results therefore suggest that the global secondary structure of a transcribed array can help explain the variable abundance of the individual crRNAs for both natural and synthetic arrays. There were some differences in the final profile of crRNAs generated in TXTL versus HEK293T cells (e.g., different extents of processing), which likely reflects the associated cohorts of active ribonucleases as well as cell-free versus transient transient expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>crRNA activity can be sequence- and context-dependent</title><p id="Par19">Low-abundance crRNAs may yield reduced nuclease activity.

While these crRNAs could be titrating out available FnCas12a protein, removing the terminal repeat did not significantly change plasmid clearance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.48 for two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>n</italic> = 3) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). Therefore, other factors likely account for the context-dependent loss of crRNA-directed nuclease activity.</p><p id="Par21">Our analysis of the native and synthetic FnCas12a arrays suggested that the global secondary structure of the transcribed array impacted crRNA abundance, which may help explain the loss of plasmid clearance activity. We therefore predicted the secondary structure of the transcribed array using NUPACK. We found that only the array from PcF-2/3/1 formed a stable, imperfect hairpin bridging spacers S3 and S1 (base-pairing probabilities of ~0.3–1.0) that disrupted the characteristic hairpin in the intervening repeat (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). To evaluate whether the imperfect hairpin predicted to form within the transcribed array was responsible for poor clearance of the PtF-1 target plasmid, we introduced five different mutations into spacer S3 to destabilize the hairpin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). We then repeated the plasmid clearance assays using variants of PtF-1 that matched the mutated spacers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). In all cases, the mutations resulted in significantly improved plasmid clearance compared to the parental array (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001–0.053 for two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>n</italic> = 3), with four of the mutants fully restoring clearance activity. As a further confirmation, we introduced additional mutations to two of the mutants (m4, m5) predicted to regain a stable, imperfect hairpin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). For both of the resulting mutants (m4′, m5′), plasmid clearance was significantly disrupted compared to the corresponding mutant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002, 0.0042 for two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, n = 3) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). These findings strongly indicate that secondary structure formation within transcribed CRISPR arrays can interfere with crRNA processing and the ensuing cRNA-directed nuclease activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The 3′ repeat of FnCas12a arrays yields an extraneous crRNA</title><p id="Par22">The second striking observation from the RNA-seq analyses was a crRNA derived from the 3′ repeat and the immediately downstream sequence outside of the array. This crRNA was observed for the seven-spacer array expressed in TXTL and HEK293T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), as well as for the two three-spacer arrays expressed in TXTL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Aside from the complications of creating an errant crRNA that could titrate available nuclease, this phenomenon could also lead to unintended DNA targeting. Given that these issues would impact native CRISPR-Cas systems, natural terminal repeats in Cas12a arrays may be under selective pressure to accumulate mutations that prevent processing. Correspondingly, analysis of diverse terminal repeats from Type V-A CRISPR-Cas systems in 14 different bacteria revealed that 79% (11/14) of the native terminal repeats harbored mutations from the array’s consensus repeat sequence expected to disrupt the sequence or predicted secondary structure in regions critical for Cas12a recognition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

This product is unlikely to bind to Cas12a given the lack of a formed stem loop structure recognized by the nuclease. The absence of the standalone product in <italic>Francisella</italic> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6C</xref>) also likely reflects differences in RNA stability between bacteria and mammalian cells.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The native terminal repeats in Cas12a arrays prevent DNA targeting by the extraneous crRNA. <bold>a</bold> CRISPR-Cas12a terminal repeats often contain mutations expected to disrupt crRNA processing.

To test this directly, we inserted the corresponding target sequence with a canonical PAM into a plasmid and measured clearance with the three-spacer FnCas12a arrays (PcF-1/3/2) shown to generate an extraneous crRNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). As expected, this array led to significant clearance of the plasmid with the expected target in comparison to the plasmid lacking the target (<italic>p</italic> = 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> for two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>n</italic> = 4) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>).

These results thus show that the extraneous crRNA can actively direct targeting, and the native terminal repeat eliminates this activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par24">Here, we devised and validated a technique called CRATES for the efficient, one-pot generation of CRISPR arrays and array libraries. The technique relies on assembling modular repeat-spacer subunits using defined junctions within the trimmed portion of the CRISPR spacers. By specifying the sequence and 5′ or 3′ directionality of each overhang of the junctions, we could minimize pairing between non-adjacent repeat-spacer subunits, allowing the scalable production of larger CRISPR arrays. Furthermore, because the junctions are fully decoupled from the repeat sequence as well as the targeting portion of the spacer sequence, we could readily generate CRISPR arrays used by three different single-effector nucleases as well as a library of CRISPR arrays. The generated arrays are distinct from sgRNA arrays, as CRISPR arrays are much more compact and are not limited to Cas9.</p><p id="Par25">Given the numerous applications of CRISPR technologies that could benefit from multiplexing with CRISPR arrays, CRATES has the potential to be widely implemented. One poignant example is using libraries of CRISPR arrays for combinatorial genetic screens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. While CRISPR-based screens principally relied on a library of single sgRNAs, there are recent examples where libraries containing sgRNA pairs were used in human cells to identify synthetic-lethal genes as well as gene pairs that drive cancer proliferation or interact with tumor protein p53 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>). In both examples, the sgRNAs had to be cloned sequentially. CRATES therefore could build on these approaches through the efficient, one-pot assembly of array libraries that extend beyond two targets, allowing the combinatorial screening of pathways with genetic redundancy. The libary we generated as a proof-of-principle demonstration exhibited a reasonable distribution uniformity given that the relative abundance of the majority of arrays (~80%) were within a 3-fold range and all of the arrays were within a seven-fold range. However, futher optimization may be needed when scaling to larger libraries.</p><p id="Par26">CRATES also helped grant unique insights into factors influencing crRNA biogenesis and crRNA-directed nuclease activity. One insight was that FnCas12a could derive a fully functional crRNA from the terminal repeat in a CRISPR array. This observation was unexpected given that only spacers flanked by two repeats are normally expected to yield crRNAs. The more practical ramification is that the terminal repeat-derived crRNA could lead to unintended targeting. We provided evidence that terminal repeats for Cas12a arrays have been under negative selection to prevent formation of a crRNA, resulting in mutations within the terminal repeat that disrupt processing. A separate option is expressing Cas12a arrays without a terminal repeat (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. However, the 3′ repeat was shown to be important when deriving Cas12a crRNAs from eukaryotic mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and we recently showed that processing of the transcribed FnCas12a array was sensitive to adjacent stable secondary structures that was exacerbated in the absence of a 3′ repeat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. As this inhibitory effect was eliminated with a native terminal repeat, these mutated repeats could be readily used with synthetic Cas12a arrays as a simple solution to prevent extraneous crRNAs and adjacent, inhibitory structures. The more practical ramification is that the terminal repeat-derived crRNA could lead to unintended targeting, at least in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Future work should evaluate the activity of these crRNAs in other cellular contexts and whether a native terminal repeat or no terminal repeat better promotes multiplexed targeting by an array. We also note the accumulation of the trimmed repeat in HEK293T cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>), indicating more work is needed to understand crRNA biogenesis in eukaryotic cells.</p><p id="Par27">The second insight was the varying abundance of processed crRNAs and its connection to crRNA-directed nuclease activity and the predicted secondary structure of the transcribed array. While prior studies of natural CRISPR arrays reported varying crRNA abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, it remained unclear why the abundance varied and whether the crRNAs exhibited compromised nuclease activity. The loss of nuclease activity that we observed was striking given that it was only observed for one of the six possible configurations of a three-spacer array, suggesting a dependence on the spacer’s sequence and context. We also provided multiple lines of evidence for the role of global RNA secondary structure and misfolding of the hairpin recognized by Cas12a as part of crRNA biogenesis. Other factors such as cryptic promoters or RNase sites could be involved, and the influence of secondary structure is likely more complicated given coupling between transcription and crRNA processing and the folding of processing intermediates. However, the predicted secondary structure of the array was an indicator of crRNA abundance, at least in the few examples we tested. Finally, it remains to be seen how frequently a crRNA loses the ability to direct nuclease activity in the context of an array; prior work did not observe any effect on spacer order<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, although the number of tested arrays and spacer sequences has been limited. Future work thus could extend these insights to develop design tools for synthetic CRISPR arrays exhibiting uniform crRNA abundances.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p id="Par28">Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> provides a list of the key resources used in this work.
