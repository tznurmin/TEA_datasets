Vascular inflammation and leukocyte trafficking may contribute to AD pathogenesis, and a better understanding of these inflammation mechanisms could therefore facilitate the development of new AD therapies. Here we show that T cells extravasate in the proximity of cerebral VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> vessels in 3xTg-AD transgenic mice, which develop both Aβ and tau pathologies. The counter-ligand of VCAM-1 – α4β1 integrin, also known as very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) – was more abundant on circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and was also expressed by a significant proportion of blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and neutrophils in AD mice. Intravital microscopy of the brain microcirculation revealed that α4 integrins control leukocyte–endothelial interactions in AD mice. Therapeutic targeting of VLA-4 using antibodies that specifically block α4 integrins improved the memory of 3xTg-AD mice compared to an isotype control. These antibodies also reduced neuropathological hallmarks of AD, including microgliosis, Aβ load and tau hyperphosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that α4 integrin-dependent leukocyte trafficking promotes cognitive impairment and AD neuropathology, suggesting that the blockade of α4 integrins may offer a new therapeutic strategy in AD.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla (Italian Multiple Sclerosis

id="Par2">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting ~6% of the global population aged &gt;65 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Its clinical symptoms include progressive memory loss, impairment of daily activities, deterioration of language, visuospatial deficits, and mood changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Both the familial and sporadic forms of AD share common neuropathological features: the progressive accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in brain parenchyma and vasculature, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein, synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Current therapies are symptomatic and do not alter the course of AD, therefore new drugs are urgently needed to slow the progression of this disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Chronic low-grade inflammation is thought to play a key role in the development of AD neuropathology. Previous studies of inflammation in AD have focused mainly on the activation of microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, several recent studies have shown that a dysfunctional blood–brain barrier associated with vascular inflammation and leukocyte migration into the brain contribute to the pathogenesis of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In particular, we and others have shown that circulating leukocytes adhere to the endothelium in cerebral vessels and migrate into the brain parenchyma in AD patients and in transgenic animals with AD-like disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Our recent data show that neutrophils (the most abundant leukocytes in the human circulation) adhere in cerebral vessels and migrate into the AD brain. They also migrate into the brain parenchyma of 3xTg-AD and 5xFAD mouse models of AD at the onset of memory deficit, secreting IL-17 and producing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that may harm endothelial and neural cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can also adhere in cerebral blood vessels and migrate into the parenchyma of AD patients, with most T cells infiltrating the hippocampus and other limbic structures, the most severely affected areas in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Leukocyte migration from the circulation through the inflamed vascular wall is a multistep process mediated by adhesion molecules and chemoattractants. It involves a succession of events including: (1) tethering (capture) and rolling, which are mediated by adhesion molecules from the selectin, mucin and integrin families and the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily; (2) chemoattractant-triggered integrin activation via leukocyte G-protein-coupled receptors; (3) firm adhesion (arrest) mediated by activated integrins and their counter-ligands from the Ig superfamily; (4) crawling mediated by β1 or β2 integrins and their ligands; and (5) transmigration (diapedesis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Integrins are a large group of heterodimeric adhesion molecules composed of α and β subunits. The most important β<sub>1</sub> integrin expressed on leukocytes is α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin (CD49d/CD29), also known as very late antigen-4 (VLA-4). Integrin α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> plays a pivotal role during T cell trafficking in the chronically inflamed central nervous system (CNS) in multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, VLA-4 also contributes to the migration of monocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils during inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. CD49d (the α4 chain of VLA-4) can be expressed with either of two β chains, namely β1 (CD29) or β7, to form VLA-4 (integrin α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub>) or integrin α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>, respectively. Integrin α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> principally binds to VCAM-1 on the vascular endothelium and mediates leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation, whereas interactions between integrin α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> and its vascular ligand MAdCAM-1 (mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1) plays a more specific role in naive T cell homing in the high endothelial venules of Peyer’s patches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Targeting the α4 chain of VLA-4 has a therapeutic effect in patients with multiple sclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS, and in Chron’s disease, an autoimmune disease of the intestine, demonstrating that blocking key adhesion mechanisms controlling leukocyte migration can efficiently mitigate chronic inflammation in human diseases.</p><p id="Par5">Leukocyte migration in the CNS has been investigated almost exclusively in the context of stroke and multiple sclerosis. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling leukocyte trafficking in the AD brain are largely unknown. Here we investigated the role of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin in leukocyte–endothelial interactions in the cerebral microcirculation of 3xTg-AD mice, which develop both amyloid and tau pathologies. We also used an antibody to block the α4 chain of VLA-4 to determine its therapeutic effect on cognitive functions and the neuropathological hallmarks of AD. We found that VLA-4 contributes to the inflammatory response in 3xTg-AD mice and could therefore be targeted for AD therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>T cells accumulate near cerebral VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> blood vessels in 3xTg-AD mice</title><p id="Par6">The expression of endothelial adhesion molecules is necessary for the recruitment of circulating leukocytes to sites of inflammation. Among the vascular adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 has a pivotal role during chronic inflammatory responses by recruiting circulating T cells. Our previous studies have shown that endothelial adhesion molecules, including VCAM-1, are detected in the CNS vessels of 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, which express transgenes corresponding to three mutant human proteins: PS1 (M146V), βAPP (Swedish) and tau (P301L)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. To determine whether VCAM-1 expression is associated with the recruitment of circulating leukocytes, we stained brain sections prepared from 3xTg-AD mice for VCAM-1 and T cells. This confirmed higher vascular VCAM-1 expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice at 6 months of age compared to wild-type control mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and data not shown). Furthermore, we observed the presence of extravascular migrating T cells, with some cells near VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> vessels in the cerebral cortex and choroid plexi of 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting that vascular inflammation and VCAM-1 expression may contribute to T cell recruitment to the AD brain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>). We also observed the adhesion of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells inside VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> cortical blood vessels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Staining with an anti-CD4 antibody confirmed that the CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrating the brains of 3xTg-AD mice also express CD4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that VCAM-1 is significantly more abundant in the brain vessels of 3xTg-AD mice and may mediate T cell migration into the CNS in these animals. To assess T cell infiltration in the brains of wild-type and 3xTg-AD mice in more detail, we conducted flow cytometry experiments on brain homogenates. We observed an increase in the abundance of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at 6 and 9 months of age in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice compared to wild-type animals, with the results reaching statistical significance at the later time point (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). However, the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells migrating in the brain was similar in wild-type and 3xTg-AD mice at 6 months, but was significantly lower in 3xTg-AD mice than wild-type animals at 9 months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), suggesting that the role of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may diminish over time in 3xTg-AD mice.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Presence of T cells near VCAM-1<sup>+</sup> vessels in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice.

Here, we found that a therapeutic blockade of α4 integrins improves the memory in cognitive tests, suggesting this therapeutic approach interferes with disease progression and cognitive impairment. We also found that the blockade reduced the neuropathological hallmarks of AD, including Aβ accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation, further supporting the beneficial effect of drugs targeting α4 integrin. Recent data showing a correlation between tau pathology and T cell accumulation in post-mortem brain samples of AD patients support our data suggesting a role for T cell migration in AD pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Prolonged microglial activation may have a detrimental role in AD, and here we show that the blockade of α4 integrin inhibits this process in 3xTg-AD mice, highlighting the anti-inflammatory effect of anti-adhesion therapy. Our results agree with recent neuropathology studies in <italic>APP/PS1</italic> mice, a model of brain amyloidosis, showing that treatment with an anti-CD49d antibody reduces microgliosis, astrogliosis, CD4 immunoreactivity and synaptic changes, without altering the Aβ plaque load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However, we observed lower levels of intracellular Aβ accumulation during earlier stages of AD and determined how blocking α4 integrins affects cognitive functions using a more complex model, in which mice develop both amyloid and tau pathologies, thus more closely representing AD neuropathology in humans. We found that the therapeutic α4 integrin blockade clearly inhibited leukocyte–vascular interactions, indicating that anti-adhesion therapies may have a beneficial effect in AD. The blockade of LFA-1 integrin has also been shown to reduce memory decline and the neuropathological hallmarks of AD in transgenic mouse models, further supporting anti-integrin drugs as a new therapeutic approach in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">The α4 integrin subunit can pair with either the β1 or β7 subunits, so drugs targeting α4 integrin not only inhibit α4β1/VCAM-1 interactions but also α4β7/MAdCAM-1 binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Blocking the α4 chain of VLA-4 with natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, has a therapeutic effect in patients with multiple sclerosis and Chron’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Following initial promising results, natalizumab was approved in 2004 by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency as monotherapy for highly active relapsing–remitting  multiple sclerosis. The observational study on multiple sclerosis patients treated with natalizumab for up to 2 years demonstrated highly improved cognitive performance and a significant reduction of clinical symptoms, suggesting that the efficacy of natalizumab against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration may be also useful in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Our previous work showed that natalizumab also reduces the frequency and severity of seizures in a patient with multiple sclerosis and epilepsy, further supporting anti-leukocyte adhesion therapy as a promising therapeutic approach in patients with brain inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. However, natalizumab and other anti-integrin or immunosuppressive therapies can induce the viral brain disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with autoimmune disorders, especially in immunosuppressed subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. The fact that AD patients do not normally receive immunosuppressive therapy, and availability of improved tests to detect patients at risk of PML argues in favour of α4-targeted therapy in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Interestingly, an association between two polymorphisms (−269 C/A and +3061 A/G) in the <italic>ITGA4</italic> gene (encoding α4 integrin) and the risk of AD has been reported recently, providing further evidence that VLA-4 contributes to AD pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. The <italic>ITGA4</italic> +3061AG genotype is also associated with the development of multiple sclerosis, which is thought to be mediated by T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. This suggests that the AG variant may change the VLA-4 α4 subunit conformation, making it bind with higher affinity to its ligand VCAM-1, increasing the accumulation of T cells in chronic inflammatory diseases of the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis and AD. However, further studies are needed to understand the functional implications of <italic>ITGA4</italic> gene polymorphisms on leukocyte trafficking in the brain during chronic neuro-inflammatory diseases.</p><p id="Par22">In conclusion, our data show that α4 integrins control leukocyte–endothelial interactions and that a therapeutic blockade can significantly inhibit neuropathological hallmarks such as Aβ deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, as well as reducing memory decline in a 3xTg-AD model. Drugs that block VLA-4 may therefore represent a new therapeutic approach in AD, which can be rapidly translated to the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par23">The research involving animals was authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health, Department of Veterinary Public Health, Nutrition and Food Safety, Directorate General of Animal Health and Veterinary Medicine, as required by Italian legislation (D.
