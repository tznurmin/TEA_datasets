This study aimed at identifying whether an outer membrane protein with molecular weight of about 22 kDa (Omp22) holds the potentials to be an efficient vaccine candidate and combat <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection. Omp22 which has a molecule length of 217 amino acids kept more than 95% conservation in totally 851 reported <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains. Recombinant Omp22 efficiently elicited high titers of specific IgG in mice. Both active and passive immunizations of Omp22 increased the survival rates of mice, suppressed the bacterial burdens in the organs and peripheral blood, and reduced the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Opsonophagocytosis assays showed <italic>in vitro</italic> that Omp22 antiserum had highly efficient bactericidal activities on clonally distinct clinical <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolates, which were partly complements-dependent and opsonophagocytic killing effects. Additionally, administration with as high as 500 μg of Omp22 didn’t cause obvious pathological changes in mice. In conclusion, Omp22 is a novel conserved and probably safe antigen for developing effective vaccines or antisera to control <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infections.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep20724.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/srep20724" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep20724</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (<italic>A. baumannii</italic>) has recently emerged to be an important conditioned nosocomial pathogen that may cause pneumonia, septicemia, urinary tract infections, and meningitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It has been included in the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) hit list of the six most dangerous microbes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The most problematic issues with <italic>A. baumannii</italic> are rapid emerging of multidrug and extremely drug resistant strains and the slow development of new antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of nonantibiotic-based intervention strategies to combat this pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Vaccine is one of the most effective intervention strategies for infection control, and functioning through approaches that differ from that of antibiotics, it is likely to circumvent complex multidrug-resistant mechanisms of <italic>A. baumannii.</italic> The immunogen candidates, reported previously to have provided potential immune protection against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection, include iron-regulated outer membrane proteins (IROMP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, formalin-inactivated whole cells (IWCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, outer membrane complexes (OMCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, biofilm-associated protein (Bap)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, poly-N-acetyl-β-(1–6)-glucosamine (PNAG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, trimeric autotransporter protein (Ata)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, K1 capsular polysaccharide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and outer membrane protein A (OmpA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, of these candidates, IWCs, OMCs and OMVs have complex compositions and some of the identified subunit protein antigens such as OmpA have shown to be toxic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which maybe cause safety concerns with their use and thus prevent their further development to be a clinically applicable vaccine. It is important for effectively fighting against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection to identify safer antigen candidates that hold the capability of eliciting protective immunity and providing cross-protection against varied clinical <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains.</p><p id="Par3">Previous studies have shown that immunization with OMVs provided strong immune protection against infections of not only homologous strains but also clonally distinct clinical isolates of <italic>A. baumannii.</italic> OMVs contain highly immunogenic outer membrane proteins, which may significantly contribute to eliciting protective immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In this current study, we successfully identified an outer membrane protein (Omp22, with a molecular weight of 22.35 kDa) from OMVs as a potential vaccine candidate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Omp22 is highly conserved outer membrane protein in <italic>A. baumannii</italic></title><p id="Par4">The DNA fragments encoding for Omp22 were amplified from ATCC 17978 and 14 clinical isolates. Alignment analyses of nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences showed that the nucleotide sequences of Omp22 from all the strains had only one nucleotide mutation (T-A) at position 495; it was T in Ab1 and Ab3 isolated from the First Affiliated Hospital and Ab5, Ab8, Ab9, Ab10, Ab12, and Ab14 isolated from the Second Affiliated Hospital, while it was A in the other strains; the nucleotide change was a synonymous mutation for the amino acid sequence and maintained the related code translated into arginine (R) in all the strains. And thus, Omp22 protein is completely conserved among all the analyzed strains including ATCC strain and the 14 clinical isolates. Further, using NCBI BLAST, the amino acid sequence obtained in this current study was compared with previously reported <italic>A. baumannii</italic> Omp22 sequences in the data bank. Among the total 851 amino acid sequences, 781, 27, 33, 2, and 8 sequences showed correspondingly 100%, 99%, 98%, 97% and 95% conservation to our sequence (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In addition, PubMed BLAST search of the human proteome using the ATCC 17978 Omp22 sequence revealed that only 10 sequences had homology with Omp22 (E values ranging 0.41 to 9.9), and the largest number of consecutive identical amino acids were less than six. The results showed that Omp22 was highly conserved across a broad array of clinical isolates of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and shared almost negligible homology with human proteins.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Conservation analyses, protein preparation, antibody induction, and expression levels in clinical isolates of Omp22.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conservation analyses of Omp22 in reported <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains using NCBI BLAST.

Majority of the expressed Trx-Omp22 presented as insoluble inclusion bodies. Subjected to a protein purification procedure consists of denaturation, refolding, and affinity chromatography, refolded recombinant Trx-Omp22 protein was prepared with a relatively high purity of more than 96% which was roughly analyzed by density scan for the stained bands on the SDS-PAGE gel using an Image lab software (Bio-Rad) (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Serum samples collected from immunized mice were used for detecting specific antibody response. The results showed that the doses of 20 μg and 50 μg elicited low titers of specific IgG at one week after the second immunization, and 50 μg produced high titers of the specific antibodies after the third immunization and maintained at least for three weeks; the doses of 10 μg and 20 μg induced low levels even after the third immunization; and mice received 5 μg dose didn’t show specific antibody response (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">The Omp22 expression in clinical isolates Ab1 through 14 were analyzed by immune blotting using obtained antiserum from immunized mice to provide detection antibodies. The antiserum specifically reacted with all clinically isolates, showing a band with molecular weight around 22 kDa (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The result indicated that Omp22 was expressed at a similar level in clinical isolates except for Ab1 strain, which showed a dramatically reduced Omp22 expression in comparison with the others. In contrast, there was no reactive bands showing for the <italic>E,coli</italic> BL21(DE3) sample, suggesting that antiserum of <italic>A. baumanii</italic> Omp22 didn’t recognize any protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mice receiving Omp22 immunization shows an increased survival and reduced bacterial burdens in a sepsis model</title><p id="Par8">After the specific antibody responses were induced by immunization with recombinant Trx-Omp22, an intraperitoneal challenge of a clinical isolate Ab1 was performed. All the mice receiving only the adjuvant as control died within 24 h. The survival rates were 100%, 33%, 33%, and 0% for the mice receiving 50 μg, 20 μg, 10 μg, and 5 μg of Trx-Omp22, respectively. The results demonstrated that the protective effects found in the immunized mice were basically in an immunization dose–dependent manner (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Together with the finding that high doses of Omp22 elicited high titers of specific antibodies, the results might indicate an important role of the specific antibodies in providing immune protection against <italic>A. baumanii</italic> infection. Bacterial burdens in major organs and blood were also detected to reflect protective effects of immunization with Trx-Omp22. Mice receiving 50 μg proteins showed significantly reduced bacterial burdens in the lung, spleen, liver, kidney and blood by approximately 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>5</sup>-folds, when compared with those in the mice receiving only adjuvant (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2B,C</xref>).

The highly conserved proteins and predicted membrane or secretion proteins were chosen preferentially.

At last, the candidate proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Omp22 was one of those being efficiently folded into soluble form and purified with affinity chromatography of nickel-agarose. Since affinity purification requires the formation of Histidine-patch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, the results indicated that Omp22 might have properly folded and possessed nature immunogenic epitopes. Taken together, Omp22 was chosen and reported in the current study for the first time that it is a potent antigen candidate for developing an effective vaccine or preparing antisera to control <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infections. High conservation of Omp22 might provide effective protection against varied clinical <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains. And, extremely low homology to human proteins implies that the risk for Omp22-elicited antibodies to cross-recognize human proteins is theoretically almost negligible. We detected Omp22 level in 14 clonally distinct clinical isolates with multiple-drug resistance, 13 of which showed a similar expression level except for Ab1 which was clearly lower than the others (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).

The data demonstrated that Omp22 expression was basically stable in clinical isolates showing multiple-drug resistance and different drug resistant profiles; and, even if Omp22 was low expressed, antiserum was still able to mediate enough opsonophagocytic killing effects against <italic>A. baunmanii</italic> cells.</p><p id="Par19">Although many features of human sepsis are not recapitulated, bacterial infection models have provided important insights into mechanisms of the host response to pathogens. Inoculation of animals with bacterial flora has been a common tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, the transient introduction of high doses of bacteria to establish high bacteremia counts does not necessarily represent a reliable sepsis model, and as high doses as 10<sup>11</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> CFU of bacteria commonly administered do not typically colonize and replicate within the host, often due to rapid lysis by complement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. This may lead to a potential model of intoxication with endotoxins rather than a true model of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. And thus, this model has limitations for sepsis study, especially for investigating the mechanism or developing a clinically applicable medicine. In contrast, models permiting an experimental host to be efficiently infected at relatively low doses and presenting an evolution of sepsis from a focus of infection more accurately reflect the course of human sepsis and facilitate the extrapolation of animal data to clinical efficacy in septic patients. However, this model depends on careful choosing of bacteria and/or host and is not easy to obtain. In some studies, neutropenia or diabetic mice have been used to make mice susceptible to lethal infection caused by <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, in which lower doses of bacteria (1.4–2 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU) were used and mice survived longer while infection was established. Those models allow the development of pulmonary inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> or resembling a clinical risk factor of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection such as diabetes to some extend<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In the current study, a common protocol with a dose of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU of bacteria mixed with 10% porcine mucin was used. Generally, the control mice died within 24 hour or 48 hour as shown in our and other groups’ similar studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The reason may attribute to that, invaded <italic>A. baumannii</italic> cells are quickly cleared in normal mice; only when the administrated bacterial load is high enough to allow survival bacteria to release toxic material such as endotoxin and produce serious damage will the death of experimental animals occur. Considering <italic>A. baumannii</italic> is a conditioned pathogen and doesn’t invade into host cells in general, the most possible effective mechanism of a vaccine is producing specific antibodies to promote opsono-phagocytosis and thus reduce the survival and proliferation of infected bacteria and the release of harmful mediators, which is not dependent on directly targeting the immune pathogenesis of sepsis. From this perspective, the model is appropriate for antigen identification and vaccine assessment. Both active and passive immunization strategies effectively protected mice from lethal challenge of Ab1 strain, evidenced by increased survival of mice, suppressed bacterial burden and reduced accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines in immunized mice. As mentioned above, Ab1 strain presented a significantly low richness of Omp22 as compared to the other 13 isolates, which didn’t produce significant influences on eliciting effective immune protection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, we investigated the possible mechanism underlying specific <italic>in vivo</italic> clearance of infected bacteria after Omp22 immunization. Through <italic>in vitro</italic> opsonophagocysis assays with endogenous complement components inactivated or with phagocytes removed, we demonstrated that specific antibody/complements-mediated opsonophagocytic killing effects was probably responsible for the <italic>in vivo</italic> bactericidal effects. On this basis, we believed that the richer the target protein distribution on bacterial cells is, the more chances bacteria hold to be bound by specific antibodies and then cleared by immune system. And thus, we chose Ab1 which has a lower expression of Omp22 than the other isolates for assessing vaccine effectiveness in sepsis model, and expected that the isolates with higher Omp22 expression should also be effectively protected. To some extent, it is supported by the <italic>in vitro</italic> opsonophgocytosis assay that the killing activities mediated by Omp22 antisera on the other Ab isolates were at least not lower than that on Ab1. Furthermore, in the sepsis model passive immunization with Omp22 antisera effectively protected mice from lethal challenge of Ab4 and Ab14 which have higher Omp22 expression than Ab1.</p><p id="Par20">Both a tumor cell line and a normal cell line were used in the study to roughly test <italic>in vitro</italic> the possible toxicity of Omp22. The results that the cells incubated with as high as 80 μg/ml of Omp22 remained above 80% viability indicated that basically Omp22 is harmless and only a high concentration of the protein preparation presented mild suppressing effects on cell growth. And, it can not be excluded that the contaminants in the protein preparation exerted the effects. Previous studies reported that 20 μg/ml <italic>A. baumannii</italic> OmpA caused a 10% reduction in the conversion of MTT to formazan crystals in incubated A549 cells, and 40 and 80 μg/ml of OmpA produced a greater than 75% reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Further, a concentration of 3 μg/ml of OmpA resulted in approximately 50% cell death and 6 μg/ml produced approximately 100% cell death in human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma Hep-2 cells. The reported results also suggested that it was likely that using different cell lines could affect the concentration of OmpA necessary for inducing cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, whereas we displayed that Omp22 preparation only showed mild suppressive effects on cell growth in both A549 and 293FT cell lines.</p><p id="Par21">The biological functions of Omp22 remain unclear till now. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to suggest its protein classification and possible functions. Domain analysis revealed Omp22 might be an “outer membrane protein-related peptidoglycan-associated (lipo) protein”, with a glycine zipper on the position of 37–81 and a peptidoglycan (PG) binding domains similar to the C-terminal domain of OmpA (OmpA_C-like) on the position of 110–213 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM94">supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>In silica</italic> homology model of Omp22 was built, and it displayed that Omp22 did not fold into a classic porin-like protein structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM94">supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). As known, porin is tightly involved into drug-resistance mechanism of bacteria and easy variations in expression and structure of porin prevent it to be a promising vaccine candidate. Omp22 has an OmpA_C-like domain, and might interact with PG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, indicting that Omp22 might modulate the biogenesis of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> OMVs, because linkages between OMP and PG are directly responsible for OMVs production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM94">supplementary Figure 1C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. As shown, specific antibodies-mediated opsonophagocytosis or activated classic complement pathway may be common mechanisms of vaccination with Omp22 or the other outer membrane proteins. Since the function of Omp22 has not been identified yet, it’s unclear whether Omp22 vaccination performs through distinct mechanism from the other proteins. Considering <italic>A. baumannii</italic> is a conditioned pathogen and in general it does not invade host cells, cellular immune or blocking interaction between bacteria and host cells by neutralizing antibodies will not be considered in this case. However, it should not be excluded that specific antibodies induced by a vaccine take effects by blocking virulence factor.</p><p id="Par22">It is not clear if using a single protein will be sufficient in clinics. <italic>A. baumannii</italic> IWC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, OMVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and OMC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> have been shown to be extremely effective in animals, due to included multiple antigenic components and immune stimulators. OMCs may have better safety than the other two, however, it still has many useless and even harmful components for eliciting specific protective immune in human. It’s quite promising to identify effective and safe antigen candidates and their combination to replace the applications of OMCs. Worth to be noted, using gene recombinant technology, an interested protein can be prepared in quantity to booster specifically its protective immune responses, while it might present only in a low richness in nature OMCs preparation and thus fail to induces effective immune response. It has been proven that a single protein, such as OmpA, Bap, and Ata, is effective in preventing <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection in animal models. However, there may be limitations for a single protein to be successfully applied in clinics. The immunogenicity of a subunit protein might be weak in human when administered alone and thus require often to be combined with an adjuvant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, conjugated to polysaccharide or protein carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, or formulated in controlled-release systems. A single protein may fail to provide sufficient protective effects against pathogen infection due to the limitation of included effective antigenic epitopes. The expression level and even amino acids sequence might change in varied clinical strains, and thus targeting to a single protein may have limited broadly protective effects and combination of homologous proteins from varied strains is required. Taken together, it’s likely that combining several proteins is required for constituting a clinically effective vaccine.

Briefly, A549 cells (a human lung epithelial cell line) and 293FT cells (human embryonic kidney cells) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U penicillin/ml, and 100 μg streptomycin/ml at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For the cell viability assays, solutions containing 0, 20, 40, or 80 μg/ml of purified Trx-Omp22 were prepared in the medium. The concentrations of both the A549 and 293FT cells were adjusted to ~1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml (100 μl/well), incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and then 20 μl of MTS reagent was added to each well. After an additional incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the optical density at 490 nm (OD<sub>490</sub>) was determined for each well.

The bacterial burdens in the blood and major organs (lung, spleen, liver, and kidney) of the mice were measured 12 h after challenging with <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. The levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum were detected. The mice were monitored continuously for seven days to determine the survival rate. Specific IgG responses in serum were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Briefly, OMVs prepared from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> ATCC 17978 were used to coat microplates at 5 μg of total protein per 100 μl in each well.

The pooled Trx-Omp22 antiserum, adjuvant control serum and naïve serum were serially diluted to final concentrations of 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 with culture medium (10 μl/well). A subset of sera was subjected to heat treatment at 56 °C for 30 min to inactivate the endogenous complement components. The test sera, bacteria, and macrophages were mixed and incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking. Finally, the mixtures were diluted and plated for bacterial counting.
