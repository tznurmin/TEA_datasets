IL-1β, one of the inflammatory cytokines released from myeloid cells in tumor microenvironment, plays an important role in development and progress of tumor. The activation of inflammasome is a critical step to secrete mature IL-1β through stepwise reactions to activate capspase-1. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in macrophages regulated the metastatic potential of tumor cells. NLRP3 inflammasome was activated by ATP in bone marrow-derived primary mouse macrophages. The metastatic potential of mouse melanoma cell line (B16F10) was determined by migration and invasion assays with transwell system. ATP-treated wild-type macrophages increased the migration and invasion of melanoma cells. However, NLRP3- or caspase-1-knockout macrophages exhibited greatly diminished ability to promote the migration and invasion of melanoma cells. In addition, treatment with celastrol, an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome, reduced the potency of macrophages to stimulate migration and invasion of melanoma cells. The results demonstrate that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages by genetic deficiency or a pharmacological inhibitor is linked to suppression of the metastatic potential of tumor cells. The results would provide a novel anti-cancer strategy to modulate tumor microenvironment by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome and consequently reducing IL-1β production.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi"

microenvironment favors tumor cells to promote tumor growth, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. One of the main features of tumor microenvironment is inflammation accompanied with the activation of immune cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. IL-1β is one of the critical cytokines to promote tumor growth and metastasis by acting on its receptor, IL-1R, and to culminate in the secondary activation of immune cells and the expression of immune cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. IL-1β requires maturation process of cleavage from pro-IL-1β transcribed via inflammatory signals and is secreted to extracellular matrix to act on its receptor on cellular membrane. Caspase-1 is the intracellular enzyme responsible for cleavage of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β. The activation of caspase-1 occurs upon the activation of inflammasomes which induces the degradation of pro-caspase-1 (pro-form) to caspase-1 (active form)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, the regulation of inflammasomes by pharmacological inhibitors is considered as an efficient strategy to reduce IL-1β levels in various inflammatory and immune diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a protein complex composing of the NLRP3, an adaptor protein, and pro-caspase-1. NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by recognizing a diverse set of inflammation-inducing stimuli that include pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by the DAMPs leads to the activation of intracellular signaling pathways such as increase in potassium efflux, production of reactive oxygen species, and lysosomal damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In particular, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the representative DAMPs that are endogenous substances derived from the host to activate NLRP3 inflammasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. ATP is released from damaged and dying cells to extracellular matrix, therefore, accumulated in high levels in inflamed site and tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These suggest that ATP accumulated in tumor microenvironment would activate NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in the increased secretion of IL-1β from immune cells.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we investigated whether the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages resulted in the regulation of metastatic potential of cancer cells. The results would provide an effective strategy to prevent tumor progression by modulating cytokine expression in tumor microenvironment.

Cellular mechanism by which ATP activates NLRP3 inflammasome includes the activation of the purinergic P2X7 receptor and the recruitment of pannexin-1 to the receptor, resulting in the opening of a large pore and the following increase of potassium efflux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

Once tumorigenesis is initiated by autonomous aberration of cells, the interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment, particularly immune cells, is critical to govern tumor evasion. Much effort has been devoted to decoding the functions of the adaptive immune system in tumor immunity surveillance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, however, the contribution of innate immune pathways to this process is less understood. Among the effectors of the innate immune system, gonad-encoding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) trigger inflammatory responses when detecting invading microorganisms or danger-associated molecules. Many PRRs, including members of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) and the HIN200 families, work by combining macromolecular complexes called inflammasomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This signaling scaffold induces innate immunity by activating protease caspase-1, which cleaves the immune and metabolic matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In particular, it induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18, resulting in inflammation and pyroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Guo <italic>et al</italic>. showed that IL-1β enhanced the growth and metastasis of tumor cells and the recruitment of myeloid cells to tumor tissue sites in breast cancer mouse models, suggesting that tumor microenvironment produces IL-1β to promote the metastatic potential of tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Late-stage human melanoma cells constitutively secrete IL-1β through spontaneous activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, promoting inflammatory environment, macrophage chemotaxis, and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our results demonstrate that IL-1β produced by macrophages stimulates the metastatic potential of melanoma cells, such as migration and invasion properties, showing the essential role of myeloid cells in the production of IL-1β in tumor microenvironment through activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in myeloid cells by a pharmacological inhibitor such as celastrol resulted in the decreased metastatic potential of melanoma cells. These results suggest the importance of NLRP3 inflammasome in the tumor microenvironment in the regulation of tumor metastasis. Therefore, the results further provide a beneficial strategy for preventing tumor metastasis by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome in immune cells and thereby reducing IL-1β levels in tumor sites.</p><p id="Par17">Interestingly, the NLRP3 inflammasome plays different roles in the tumorigenesis of melanoma in a stage-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Silencing ASC expression resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest, reduced cell viability, and downregulation of tumorigenesis in metastatic melanoma while silencing ASC expression in primary melanoma led to increased cell viability with enhanced tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, Drexler <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that ASC exhibited different impacts on tumorigenesis depending on the different cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Mice had more tumors than control group when ASC was specifically deficient in keratinocytes, suggesting that ASC may be a tumor-suppressor in keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

In contrast, similar to our results showing the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in myeloid cells in enhancing the metastatic potential, mice with a specific deficiency of ASC in myeloid cells developed reduced skin cancer incidence, showing its pro-inflammatory role in myeloid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">The influence of the NLRP3 inflammasome appears controversial in colitis-associated colon cancer. Unlike our results and those of Drexler <italic>et al</italic>., the NLRP3 inflammasome expressed in hematopoietic cells exerted a protective role against colitis-associated cancer as the increased tumor burden correlated with the downregulation of IL-1β expression at the tumor site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Caspase-1 deficiency resulted in enhanced tumor formation in the azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate colitis-associated colorectal cancer mouse model through the regulation of colonic epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, but not through the regulation of inflammatory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">The anti-inflammatory properties of celastrol have previously been reported. Celastrol inhibited lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced the activation of immune cells, mediated through the suppression of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We previously reported that the inhibitory effects of celastrol on LPS-induced inflammation were mediated by blocking LPS binding to TLR4/MD2 complex in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In this study, we show that celastrol suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome induced by ATP or nigericin. Celastrol inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome induced by another activator, uric acid crystals (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) although the inhibitory potency was weak. Interestingly, celastrol did not suppress the activation of other inflammasomes such as AIM2 nor NLRC4 inflammasome in primary mouse macrophages (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Decrease of cell viability was observed by ATP treatment possibly due to increase of pyroptosis accompanied by NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). However, treatment of celastrol in addition to ATP did not significantly enhance cell death (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Furthermore, celastrol did not show any dose-dependent effect on cell viability (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). It is reported that inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome by celastrol is possibly mediated through the down-regulation of reactive oxygen species production and NF-κB activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In addition, the induction of autophagy was suggested as the mechanism by which celastrol inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

The inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome by celastrol in macrophages results in the suppression of tumor metastatic potential.
