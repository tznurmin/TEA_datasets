A demonstration of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 restoration significantly decreased CSC proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and sphere formation in NSCLC. LncRNA MBNL1-AS1 functioned as a sponge of miR-301b-3p, which inverted the inhibitory role of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 in CSC proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and sphere formation in NSCLC. LncRNA MBNL1-AS1 positively regulated TGFBR2 which was a target gene of miR-301b-3p.

NSCLC metastatic progression is correlated with the high mortality rates associated with NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Early diagnosis of NSCLC has become a clinical essential in planning and providing effective treatment, which markedly improves the overall survival rate of patients with NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the prognosis of patients suffering from NSCLC remains to be unfortunate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In recent years, the theory of cancer stem cells (CSCs), that cancers are maintained by subpopulations of tumor cells with features of stem cells and progenitors, has served as a focus of in-depth investigations in cancer research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A research reported the principal involvement of CSCs in tumor progression, recurrence, and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. CSCs due to their high tumorigenicity can be observed in multiple human cancers, with great significance in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Targeting CSCs has been therapeutically proven as a curative strategy for NSCLC treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], while the specific mechanisms still remain as a topic of research. Thus, it is necessary to develop new treatment strategies against CSCs as a mode of better clinical intervention in NSCLC.</p><p id="Par35">Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), comprising of over 200 nucleotides in length, with vital functionality as precarious modulators of cancer biology with significant impacts on cell proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. MBNL has been proven as a participant in the modulation of selective splicing of pre-mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. MBNL1 plays a vital role in the initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) by reducing the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. LncRNA MBNL1-AS1 has been elucidated to be downregulated in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Existing literature has implicated the functionality of various miRNAs like miR-504 as facilitators along the progression of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], thereby shedding light on the urgency for identification of novel valuable therapeutic targets for NSCLC. A clinically proven correlation has been implicated by miR-301b with vasoconstriction in pulmonary hypertension by regulating a target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The participation of miR-301b-3p was proven to be vital in myogenic differentiation by targeting Rb1-inducible coiled-coil 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Wu et al. have confirmed the presence of an aberrantly expressed miR-301b along the progression of lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, microarray analysis from the current study revealed and verified the transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGFBR2) as a target of miR-301b-3p. The TGFBR2 belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase family and the TGF-β receptor subfamily, and cases of disrupted TGF-β pathway have been demonstrated to stimulate tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Accumulating evidence from a previous study revealed that TGFBR2 depletion also implicates along the progression of carcinogenesis of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. With the abovementioned literature serving as a hypothesis, we obtained NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues to explore and develop tumorigenicity assay in nude mice in order to verify the conceivable effects of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 on the cellular processes of NSCLC CSCs via miR-301b-3p and TGFBR2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par36">The study was performed with the approval of the Ethics Committee of The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital.

Subsiding the DEG screening, the heat maps of the 50 DEGs were drawn (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), which were representative of a significantly downregulated lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 in NSCLC tissues. Moreover, lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 expression was higher in the cytoplasm with respect to LncATLAS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). LncRNA MBNL1-AS1 was speculated to affect the NSCLC disease by absorbing miRNA. Thus, we predicted the miRNAs that were regulated by lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 in the RAID database, which highlighted 33 miRNAs. On comparing various parameters among the 33 miRNAs and differential miRNAs in GSE102286, 4 crucial intersected miRNAs were chosen for subsequent experimentation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), including hsa-miR-301b-3p, hsa-miR-30d-5p, hsa-miR-218-5, and hsa-miR-30a-5p. The expression profiles of the 4 miRNAs in GSE102286 are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d, which revealed that miR-301b was upregulated, whereas the other 3 miRNAs exhibited a contradictory trend, while lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 was aberrantly downregulated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Therefore, our team of researchers speculated the functionality of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 as a molecular sponge of miR-301b-3p to influence NSCLC. Then, the target genes of miR-301b-3p were predicted in the mirDIP, miRDB, miRSearch, RNA22, and miRTarBase databases. After comparing the results with DEGs in GSE33532 in order to obtain the intersected gene, TGFBR2 was selected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). TGFBR2 was downregulated in NSCLC based on GSE33532 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f).

Firstly, following the instructions of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), oe-lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 was transported into A549-SP<sup>+</sup> with or without miR-301b-3p mimic. CCK-8, clone formation assay, scratch test, and transwell assay displayed that lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 elevation suppressed the cell viability, IC50 value, migration, and invasion of A549-SP<sup>+</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a–e), whereas miR-301b-3 rescued A549-SP<sup>+</sup> from lncRNA MBNL1-AS1.

RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were performed to determine the TGFBR2 mRNA and protein levels in 56 NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues, which showed that the TGFBR2 mRNA and protein levels were lower in the NSCLC tissues than the adjacent normal tissues (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Moreover, the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated with reduced luciferase activity in A549-SP<sup>+</sup> co-transfected with miR-301b-3p-mimic and TGFBR2-wt (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> a and c). Simultaneously, RNA pull-down showed an elevated mRNA level of TGFBR2 enriched in bio-miR-301b-3p (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d), suggesting that miR-301b-3p could specifically bind to TGFBR2. In order to further verify whether lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 regulates the TGFBR2 expression by competitively binding to miR-301b-3p, the miR-301b-3p-inhibitor, miR-301b-3p-mimic, and oe-lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 plasmids were introduced into the cells following the instructions of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

The current study was performed with an aim to explain the suppressive role of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 in NSCLC in an attempt to further elucidate the underlying mechanism associated with miR-301b-3p-targeted TGFBR2. The key observations of the current study were primarily centered around the protection of CSC cells from the degrading nature of proliferation, invasion, drug resistance, and sphere formation in NSCLC by activating TGFBR2 via a blockade of the miR-301b-3p upon restoration of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 expression.</p><p id="Par64">Initially, the current study revealed that lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 is downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cells. The dysregulation of lncRNA expression has been acknowledged as an implication in the tumorigenesis of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Upon detection of the expression of several lncRNAs, the lncRNA HMlincRNA717 and lncRNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) were clinically proven to be poorly expressed in NSCLC and associated with an inferior prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our findings were consistent with the findings of an existing research, which demonstrated the lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 to be poorly expressed in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, the current study disclosed the functionality of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 as a molecular sponge of miR-301b-3p, due to its persistently high expression in NSCLC tissues and cells. A previous study demonstrated the liberating property of lncRNAs on various RNA transcripts by functioning as ceRNAs to implicitly regulate miRs, and lncRNAs participate in ceRNA networks and mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA crosstalk, which is implicated in human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

An aberrant expression of miRNAs has been observed in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including various human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Shi et al. indicated an overexpression of miR-301a in NSCLC tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

The results of biological analysis and relevance analysis further verified TGFBR2 as a target gene of miR-301b-3p, which has a positive correlation with lncRNA MBNL1-AS1. A previous study speculated a consistently poor expression of TGFBR2 in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

An existing research confirmed a stimulated proliferation in combination with suppressed apoptosis of the skeletal muscle cells upon lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 upregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].
