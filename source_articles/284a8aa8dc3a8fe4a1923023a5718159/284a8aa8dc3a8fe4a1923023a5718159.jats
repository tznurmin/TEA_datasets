Options to study these functions with direct relevance to the human condition remain severely limited when using conventional cell cultures, microfluidic systems, organoids, animal surrogates or human studies. To replicate <italic>in vitro</italic> the tissue architecture and microenvironments of native intestine, we developed a 3D porous protein scaffolding system, containing a geometrically-engineered hollow lumen, with adaptability to both large and small intestines. These intestinal tissues demonstrated representative human responses by permitting continuous accumulation of mucous secretions on the epithelial surface, establishing low oxygen tension in the lumen and interacting with gut-colonizing bacteria.

syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, have attracted considerable attention from biologists, microbiologists, immunologists and pharmacologists, as millions of people suffer from these maladies worldwide leading to significant gastrointestinal morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. A lack of correlated human physiological responses renders living animals unsuitable models to study the causal factors and treatment cascades of human intestinal infections and disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The current state-of-the-art in tissue engineering of human intestine <italic>in vitro</italic>, despite a promising alternative to animal models and an exceptionally powerful tool for <italic>in-situ</italic> visualization and continuous monitoring of the infectious processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, has fallen short in demonstrating the elaborate tissue architecture and complex mucosal barrier functions of native intestines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> formation of the double-layered mucus, of which the outer layer provides a habitat for commensal microbes and the inner layer dictates the first line of immune defense against invading pathogens, remains a particular challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Mucus production has been readily achieved using mucus-secreting cells, but this implementation holistically involves a trade-off between functions of tight junctions and those of mucus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Microfluidic-based mechanical stimulation methods, though proven capable of triggering increased mucus secretion from epithelial cells, are mainly addressed to the two-dimensional (2D) planar cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Another pressing challenge for bioengineering models of human intestine lies in <italic>in vitro</italic> generation and dynamic control of an <italic>in vivo</italic>-like, oxygen-restricted luminal microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. 2D culture approaches to date, with limited geometrical tunability, variously rely on pre-gassed culture media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and therefore negate the formation of natural oxygen gradients which are critical in driving functional outcomes, e.g. the reciprocal interaction between intestinal microbiota and altered epithelial responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Cystic organoids, while resembling the intestinal crypt-villus microtopography, develop fully enclosed luminal spaces and therefore hinder crosstalk between discrete mini-niches which thereby limits utility in studies of intestinal pathology, e.g. chronic infections that affect various sites along the gastrointestinal tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Regenerated intestine can be pursued by implanting intestinal organoids units into mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, as more of an <italic>in vivo</italic> intestine model.</p><p>Here we report our progress towards the construction of a novel three-dimensional (3D) <italic>in vitro</italic> model of human intestine, using silk protein as a scaffolding material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, mimicking both the structure and function of native intestine. These modular intestine constructs feature a 3D geometrically-engineered hollow lumen lined with a monolayer of highly polarized epithelial cells, which are further supported and nourished by the surrounding myofibroblasts dispersed in the porous scaffold bulk. The resulting <italic>in vitro</italic> models properly represent the characteristic functions of human intestine, especially to maintain a continuous mucus double layer covering the epithelial surface and a progressive proximal-to-distal reduction in oxygen tension through the intestinal lumen. Sustained cultivation of the intestine system for months, together with the scalable and integrative nature of the tissue engineering techniques, could deepen understanding of human intestinal infection, disease and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Compartmentalized human intestinal tissue on 3D silk protein scaffolds</title><p>Our approach to establish a porous silk scaffold system for intestine engineering and the cell seeding strategy are summarized in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a–c</xref>. and the online methods. Smooth wires and threaded rods (screws) were employed during the scaffolding to generate non-patterned and patterned hollow channel compartments within the silk bulks to house the epithelial cells. We engineered intestine models by culturing human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells) on the surface of silk scaffold lumens and primary human intestinal myofibroblasts (H-InMyoFibs) within the scaffold bulk space. Enterocyte-like Caco-2 and Goblet-like HT29-MTX cells are routinely used in the establishment of intestinal model systems for nutrient/drug absorption and host-pathogen interaction studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, while H-InMyoFibs are fibroblasts that secrete cytokines and growth factors to support the growth, differentiation and expansion of the human intestinal epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells (3:1, Supporting Information Fig. 1, a ratio reflects the native intestine population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>) were injected into the hollow channels allowing the luminal attachment and growth. The primary human intestinal myofibroblasts (H-InMyoFibs) were delivered into the porous scaffold bulk space to support the growth of the epithelial cells. After cell seeding, we first performed F-actin staining on the scaffolds to visualize the general spatial distribution of cells in the engineered intestinal tissues at day 10 post cell seeding (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>) and then used specific biomarkers to discriminate between the epithelial cells and H-InMyoFibs seeded on the different compartments of the scaffolds (lumen lining vs bulk sponge, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f–m</xref>). The staining results using cell-specific biomarkers indicated that the design of the scaffolds (non-patterned or patterned lumens) and cell seeding strategy (lumen lining epithelial cells vs. bulk sponge seeded H-InMyoFibs) successfully localized different cell lineages within the scaffold compartments as planned; intestinal epithelial markers (ZO-1, E-caherin and villin) were detected in the hollow channel surface (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f,g</xref> and Supporting Information Fig. 2) and a myofibroblast marker (SM22α) was detected in the scaffold bulk (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1l,m</xref>). Cells grown on scaffolds formed columnar structure (Supporting Information, Fig. 3). Fully polarized epithelial cells were also demonstrated by the high packing density of microvilli with continuous brush borders across the cells (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h,i</xref> and Supporting Information Fig. 4) and the apical alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j,k</xref>). H-InMyoFibs in the scaffold bulk were processed for Calcein-AM staining (live cell staining) to determine cell seeding efficiency and proliferation in the bulk (Supporting Information Fig. 5). The H-InMyoFibs were evenly dispersed and began to spread in the bulk space after 24 hours (Supporting Information Fig. 5a). The pores of the scaffolds supported H-InMyoFibs for at least 8 weeks (Supporting Information Fig. 5b–d) and the deletion of H-InMyoFibs in the co-culture systems resulted in shorter-term growth and differentiation of the epithelial cells based on the analysis of scaffolds containing only the Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells (Supporting Information, Fig. 6).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Human intestines on 3D porous silk scaffolds.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>) Schematics of the fabrication process for building silk-based porous scaffolds for 3D human intestine engineering. Silk scaffolds with hollow channels were prepared using a sequential six step process involving silk regeneration, cylindrical PDMS mold casting, insertion of Teflon-coated wires or Nylon screw across the cylinder, application of the silk solution, lyophilization and β-sheet induction. Upon completion of this process, the Teflon-coated wires or Nylon screw was removed, leaving a 3D, porous scaffold with a 2 mm diameter of non-patterned or screw-patterned (patterned, ridge like features with a height of 400 μm) hollow channels spanning the length of the scaffold and a bulk space that contained interconnected pores surrounding the channel.

Epithelial cells grown on 2D transwells with the same initial number of cell seeding and the support of H-InMyoFibs were used as controls. We carried out our analyses of the thickness of mucus layer on day 21 post seeding, as mucus production identified in both transwell and 3D scaffold systems increased from day 10, reaching a peak on day 21. We first detected the expression of MUC2, a structural component of the intestinal mucus layer, by immunostaining to localize the mucus layers. At day 21, full coverage of MUC2 on the epithelia with tight junctions was found in co-cultures on both transwell inserts and scaffold lumens. The 3D constructs showed an increase in luminal MUC2 fluorescence intensity compared to the transwells (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a–c</xref>). Next, Alcian blue staining of cross-sections of these constructs was used to measure the thickness of the mucus layers. The intestinal epithelial cells on the 3D scaffolds 21 days post seeding resulted in a cell monolayer coated with a compact inner layer and a loose outer layer of mucus (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). The mucus layers were approximately 11 and 17 μm thick in the 3D non-patterned and patterned scaffolds, respectively (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). In contrast the mucus layer was only about 4 μm thick in the 2D system without a clear distinction between the inner and outer layers (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>3D silk scaffolds increase the thickness of the mucus layer of the intestinal epithelial cells.</p><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) Confocal microscopy images of immunostaining of MUC-2, ZO-1 and DAPI of Caco-2/HT29-MTX cultured on 2D transwells (<bold>a</bold>) and non-patterned (<bold>b</bold>) and patterned (<bold>c</bold>) 3D silk scaffolds 21 days post cell seeding.

To explore if the cells in the 3D lumen would generate a different oxygen profile in the lumen than the cells grown on the open, exterior growth surface in transwells, an oxygen probe was used to quantify oxygen levels (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In the 2D cultures on transwell inserts (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), an oxygen tension of 13% was maintained with the confluent epithelial monolayer. In contrast, the intestinal epithelial cells lining the interior surfaces of the 3D scaffolds experienced decreased oxygen levels that mimicked <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. Oxygen diffusion into the cell cultures, driven by this vertical oxygen gradient was dictated by the oxygen consumption kinetics and metabolic activities of the cells, based on cell-free transwell controls. The 3D models of human intestinal tissue (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,c</xref>) exhibited depth-graded oxygen profiles in the luminal direction. In <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, a region of microaerobic conditions (pO<sub>2</sub> between 5% and 2%) was identified at depths ranging from 2 to 5 mm into the non-patterned intestinal lumen, bordered by a nanaerobic region (pO<sub>2</sub> ~ 1%) at the depth of 5 to 6 mm. Patterned scaffolds and the resulting intestinal lumens (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) added a new dimension to the oxygen profiles. A highly oxygen-deficient, anaerobic condition (pO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 0.1%) was found at a depth of 2 to 6 mm in the patterned lumens.

After about 4 weeks the cultures on transwells started to disintegrate and detach due to cell overgrowth and multilayer formation.

In addition, the overall expression levels of all markers from cells on 3D scaffolds were significantly higher than on transwells across all time points; patterned scaffolds generated relatively higher levels of all markers when compared to the non-patterned 3D scaffolds.

All steps and processes of intestinal tissue modeling can be scaled and automated related to the system designs. This robust protein scaffolding method differs substantially from existing <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches in its profound reflection of the 3D compartmentalized structure and complex multicellular organization of the native tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Physical characteristics of different intestine regions, including lumen dimension, shape and surface features, can be instantiated to improve the model’s site specificity and biological relevance. On the other hand, cellular diversity of the 3D culture can be further expanded, e.g. to encode a hierarchy of innate immune responses, by using different cell configurations (Supporting Information text 1 and 2).</p><p>The construction of a central hollow lumen, with emphasis on its tunable surface topography, enabled us to reconstruct a 3D-supported, intestinal epithelial interface <italic>in vitro</italic>. For instance, these 3D intestine constructs exhibited continuous mucus accumulation, with thickness ranging between 10 and 20 μm, which constitutes an indispensable prerequisite for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of human intestinal host-microbial interplay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, this mucus-protected 3D epithelium monolayer, with the apical surface facing inward towards the lumen space and the basal surface associated with underlying myofibroblasts, autonomously established a microenvironmental gradient of oxygen tension, decreasing from proximal to distal regions in an <italic>in vivo</italic>-like fashion. This bioengineered 3D system, therefore, facilitated ready access to the full range of luminal oxygen conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>, under either physiological stresses or pathological stimuli. The depth-graded oxygen profiles reflect a kinetic limitation in oxygen transport as a result of the competition between the oxygen consumption of cells and the diffusion of oxygen into culture media. The dramatically lower pO<sub>2</sub> in the 3D patterned system may be due to the increased epithelial cell mass per unit of length of the lumen. At the high-oxygen end of the spectrum, for example, microaerophilic conditions can be created and controlled in the surface-engineered, small intestinal lumen by dynamically perfusing the scaffolds to enhance the oxygen supply to the villus epithelial surfaces. Instead, at the fully anaerobic end, 3D tissue scaffolds with plain lumens could be cultured in a hypoxic chamber or the luminal channel can be perfused with culture media pre-equilibrated with strict anaerobic conditions.</p><p>More closely representing a multitude of <italic>in vivo</italic> human intestinal responses, our 3D intestine tissue constructs have been shown to potentially support the <italic>in vitro</italic> luminal colonization of intestinal bacteria, highlighting the potential to recapitulate <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of the gut microbiota dominated by anaerobic bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

One limitation of this system is that the tissue functions tend to decrease after a few weeks post cell seeding; perfusion of these 3D scaffolds by a bioreactor system may help to achieve dynamic flow and enhance intestinal functional performance over longer time frames. We envision that the new 3D intestine model presented here, readily integrable into a series of human organ mimics, will shed new light on the interconnected and interdependent roles of intestinal functions in a broad context of human well-being.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Cell lines</title><p>The Caco-2 (CRL-2102) cell line was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and HT29-MTX cell line was obtained from the Publich Health England Culture Collections (Salisbury, Great Britain).

Total bound Yptb were detected within scaffolds using <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>-specific rabbit antisera with a goat anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Constructs with LGG were stained with BacLight™ Red Bacterial Stain (Invitrogen) and DAPI. These specimens were then scanned by confocal microscopy as mentioned above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Intestinal epithelial cells on the transwell inserts or on the luminal surface of scaffolds were detached with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen Mini mRNA Extraction kit. RNA was reverse-transcribed using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Six nanograms of cDNA were used for real-time PCR amplification for each well, using primer sequences shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">table S1</xref>. For each gene tested we performed three experimental replicates and four biological replicates.
