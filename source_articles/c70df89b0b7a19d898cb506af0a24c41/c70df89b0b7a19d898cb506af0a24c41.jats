Blood stage fitness costs often accompany the evolution of drug resistance, with the expectation that relatively fitter parasites will be more likely to spread in populations. With the recent emergence of artemisinin resistance, it is important to understand the relative competitive fitness of the metabolically active asexual blood stage parasites. Genetically distinct drug resistant parasite clones with independently evolved sets of mutations are likely to vary in asexual proliferation rate, contributing to their chance of transmission to the mosquito vector.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">An optimized in vitro 96-well plate-based protocol was used to quantitatively measure-head-to-head competitive fitness during blood stage development between seven genetically distinct field isolates from a hotspot of emerging artemisinin resistance and the laboratory strain, NF54. These field isolates were isolated from patients in Southeast Asia carrying different alleles of <italic>kelch13</italic> and included both artemisinin-sensitive and artemisinin-resistant isolates. Fluorescent labeled microsatellite markers were used to track the relative densities of each parasite throughout the co-growth period of 14–60 days. All-on-all competitions were conducted for the panel of eight parasite lines (28 pairwise competitions) to determine their quantitative competitive fitness relationships.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Twenty-eight pairwise competitive growth outcomes allowed for an unambiguous ranking among a set of seven genetically distinct parasite lines isolated from patients in Southeast Asia displaying a range of both <italic>kelch13</italic> alleles and clinical clearance times and a laboratory strain, NF54. This comprehensive series of assays established the growth relationships among the eight parasite lines. Interestingly, a clinically artemisinin resistant parasite line that carries the wild-type form of <italic>kelch13</italic> outcompeted all other parasites in this study. Furthermore, a <italic>kelch13</italic> mutant line (E252Q) was competitively more fit without drug than lines with other resistance-associated <italic>kelch13</italic> alleles, including the C580Y allele that has expanded to high frequencies under drug pressure in Southeast Asian resistant populations.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This optimized competitive growth assay can be employed for assessment of relative growth as an index of fitness during the asexual blood stage growth between natural lines carrying different genetic variants associated with artemisinin resistance. Improved understanding of the fitness costs of different parasites proliferating in human blood and the role different resistance mutations play in the context of specific genetic backgrounds will contribute to an understanding of the potential for specific mutations to spread in populations, with the potential to inform targeted strategies for malaria therapy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Competitive growth</kwd><kwd>Fitness</kwd><kwd>Artemisinin resistance</kwd><kwd><italic>kelch13</italic></kwd><kwd>Population genetics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">P01 AI127338</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">R37 A1048071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferdig</surname><given-names>Michael T.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Timothy J.

Fitness costs can manifest as reduced in-host growth rate that can lead to declining frequencies of drug-resistant pathogens in populations when drug pressure is removed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Competitive growth is one indicator of the relative fitness of co-infecting parasite lines. For pathogens including HIV, fungi, and bacteria, the gold standard for measuring fitness in vitro and in vivo relies on labeling methods to assay the relative growth success of the competing lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While both cooperative and competitive interactions can occur between co-infecting conspecific pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] head-to-head growth outcomes usually reflect the innate proliferation rates of each of the competing genotypes.</p><p id="Par20">Competitive growth assays have been used to determine the fitness relationships among drug-resistant <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> lines. For example, a quantitative PCR method was used to track the interactions and competitive outcomes of mixed infections containing a chloroquine-sensitive (CQ-S) and a CQ-resistant (CQ-R) line in the absence of CQ; the CQ-S parasite line consistently outcompeted the CQ-R line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Clinical artemisinin resistance (Art-R), manifests as a delayed clearance of parasites from a patient’s blood following drug treatment and is defined as a parasite clearance half-life ≥ than 5 h after drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Parasites isolated from these patients have been studied using competitive growth assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and a few focused laboratory experiments have demonstrated a cost of Art-R mutations in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lines grown in the absence of drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The broad diversity of the genetic variants associated with Art-R and their relative effects on fitness have not been thoroughly investigated. The delayed clearance phenotype (clinical Art-R) is associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encoded by <italic>kelch13</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As of 2016, 124 independent non-synonymous substitutions in <italic>kelch13</italic> had been identified: 46 mutations unique to Southeast Asia, 62 found in sub-Saharan Africa, and 16 found in both regions. Not all of these mutations have been associated with clinical resistance; only those mutations found in Southeast Asia or both regions have been linked, in vivo or in vitro, to resistance-related phenotypes. These mutations typically encode changes in the propeller domain of the protein coded by <italic>kelch13</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In spite of the many mutations in <italic>kelch13</italic> and independent origins of Art-R in Southeast Asia, only one of these mutations (C580Y) is expanding in frequency and replacing other <italic>kelch13</italic> mutations along the Thailand–Myanmar border and in Cambodia, Vietnam, and southern Laos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Notably, some Art-R parasites on the Thailand–Myanmar border and in Cambodia do not carry coding mutations in <italic>kelch13</italic>, indicating that factors other than, and/or in addition to, altered <italic>kelch13</italic> contribute to this resistance phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Technology advances are allowing researchers to monitor and observe the emergence and spread of Art-R in real time, an approach that was not available for tracking the worldwide sweep of CQ-R from a few independent origins decades before. Commensurate with this capacity to observe emerging drug resistance is the opportunity to anticipate and act to limit the devastation that would ensue if artemisinin-based drug combination therapies fail worldwide. Understanding the genetic basis of relative fitness and propensities of different forms of Art-R parasites to spread will be one component of a multi-pronged strategy to retain this valuable drug that has in part, underpinned the remarkable decline in malaria deaths over the past 15 years.</p><p id="Par23">To date, experimental competitive growth studies of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites in vitro have been limited to a few pairwise competitions to discern growth relationships among a few (two or three) parasite lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] due to the volume requirement required to determine the ratio of the competing parasite lines. Typically, the ratio of each line in an in vitro competition assay is determined by pyrosequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] amplicon sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], or quantitative PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These methods are accurate and can easily distinguish competing parasite lines, however they can be cumbersome, time consuming, and costly. These methods require relatively large volumes of either a DNA template, usually obtained via a blood DNA extraction, or enough parasitized red blood cells for analysis, which requires a large culture volume. Decreasing the volume of culture needed in order to distinguish between competing parasite lines would allow for a much higher throughput and require less time and reagents.</p><p id="Par24">This optimized method uses straight-from-blood PCR for microsatellite genotyping; increasing the throughput and efficiency of competitive growth assays compared to previous methods. Here, a 96-well plate-based in vitro competitive growth assay is used to compare eight parasite lines (28 head-to-head competitions) to quantify the relative fitness relationships of a series of field-isolated Art-R and Art-sensitive lines. This tool expands the capacity to precisely catalogue fitness relationships that can facilitate a broader genetic-based approach to understanding, predicting, and preventing the spread of drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Parasite culture</title><p id="Par25">Cryopreserved stocks of cloned parasite lines were thawed and grown in complete media (CM) [0.5% Albumax II (Gibco), 10 μg/ml gentamycin (Gibco), 7.5% sodium bicarbonate (Corning), and incomplete media (ICM) (Gibco)] at 5% haematocrit in O<sup>+</sup> red blood cells (RBC).

Briefly, parasites were grown to 40 ml cultures at 5% hematocrit and schizonts were synchronized using a MACS magnet column (Miltenyi Biotec) into 10 ml cultures. Once schizonts had burst and merozoites had reinvaded, 2 ml of culture was transferred to 6 wells of 12-well cell culture cluster plates (Corning) at 2% hematocrit and 2% parasitaemia. Half of the wells were treated with 700 nM dihydroartemisinin (DHA) (Sigma) and the other half of the wells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (ThermoFisher). After 6 h all cultures were washed with ICM three times and transferred to a new plate to ensure complete removal of the drug. After an additional 66 h, slides were made on all cultures and 5000 RBCs were counted per culture. Proliferation was measured by the percent parasitaemia in the DHA treated culture over the percent parasitaemia in DMSO treated cultures. Two biological replicates each with three technical replicates were carried out for NHP4026, NHP4076, NHP4333, NHP1337, and NF54.

Each competition was established in both formats (culture flasks at 5 ml volumes and in 96-well plates, each well with a total volume of 200 μl), each with three technical replicates. Each competition consisted of two genetically distinct parasite lines each at 0.5% parasitaemia for a total of 1% parasitaemia at the start of the assay. Every IDC, cultures were diluted to 1% parasitaemia in the 5 ml flasks, or to 50 μl volume in the 96-well plate repetitions, and fresh RBCs and media were added. Samples from each culture were collected and stored at − 80 °C at the time of each dilution.

Cryopreserved stocks of all eight parasite lines were thawed (which took about 2 h) and only grown to 10 ml of culture, which took approximately two life cycles.

The total time from thawing to assay initiation was approximately 10 days. Alternatively, the remaining culture (not used to set up the first biological replicate) can be grown for an additional cell cycle and set up in the 96-well plates with three technical replicates as long as the culture remains synchronized (at least 80% of the parasites in culture were in the early ring stage of the life cycle); this accommodates biological replicates in the study design.</p><p id="Par37">After competitive growth assays were set up in 96-well plates, they were maintained in the plate for 20–60 days (until one parasite line reached 95% of the population).

To differentiate between the two competing parasite lines, samples were collected from diluting the parasitaemia each life cycle and stored at − 80 °C until they were analysed. To increase efficiency, samples were analysed in large groups every 10 days to monitor the progress of each competition (samples were taken every 2 days, so 5 samples were analysed per competition from 28 competitions for a total of 140 samples every 10 days). Straight-from-blood PCR eliminated any need for DNA extractions, which saved time and greatly decreased the amount of whole culture needed for each PCR reaction (only 1 μl is needed). Setting up 140 reactions for PCR took approximately 1 h and running on a thermocycler took 1 h. Diluting the PCR and preparing the 140 samples to run on the CEQ took approximately 1 h. Samples were loaded and run on the CEQ (took about 8 h to run 140 samples); the run time depends on the number of samples and the specific fragment analysis machine being used.

In other cases, such as for the mid-range NHP1337 (C580Y, Art-R) versus NHP4302 (<italic>kelch13</italic>-wt, Art-R) the winning parasite did not always fully replace its competitor over 60 days.</p><p id="Par50">This study is the first to use a panel of seven isolates and the NF54 strain and conduct all-on-all pairwise competitions between them. This yielded transitive outcomes and an unambiguous ranking of competitive growth success, creating a robust and reproducible phenotype that has potential to be modeled and predicted. The transitivity of the competition outcomes could be in part due to direct differences in the proliferation rates of the individual lines. However, it is unlikely such simple growth relationships are the only factors at play. For example, non-linear growth relationships resulting from kin discrimination, wherein parasites recognize genetically dissimilar parasites and adjust to surrounding cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], quorum sensing, a mechanism by which parasites use signal molecules to elicit changes in gene expression that affect behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], as well as parasite communications mitigated by release of exosome-like vesicles capable of delivering molecules and genes from infected RBCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] can all be revealed by these growth relationships.</p><p id="Par51">Different competitive fitness levels of cultured parasites show the impact of different natural genotypes (i.e. drug resistance genes in their natural genetic backgrounds) on relative in vitro growth rates. This measure of fitness, while assessing relative costs of resistance to physiology and growth, does not directly measure the transmission of sexual stages to the mosquito vector. However, the experimental rigor afforded by this assay makes in vitro competitive growth a useful surrogate for biological fitness (transmission) that may predict tendencies of drug resistant isolates to spread in natural populations. With the emergence of Art-R parasites, tools to anticipate and counteract their expansion are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The high competitive fitness of NHP4026 reported here is intriguing because this is the slowest-clearing parasite line out of the seven isolates and the NF54 strain that were tested (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The Art-R status was confirmed using the standard in vitro ring-stage survival assay (RSA) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>) of this parasite that lacks a <italic>kelch13</italic> coding SNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Slow-clearing <italic>kelch13</italic> wild-type parasites have been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]; however, based on reports of increasing prevalence Art-R associated <italic>kelch13</italic> polymorphisms, it would have been expected that <italic>kelch13</italic> SNPs that are Art-R (NHP4333, NHP1337, NHP4076) would be more fit than <italic>kelch13</italic> wild-type resistant lines, with <italic>kelch13</italic> wild-type susceptible parasites being the most fit of all. However, strikingly different outcomes were observed than were expected.</p><p id="Par53">All three <italic>kelch13</italic> Art-R mutant lines in this study outcompeted two Art-susceptible lines (NHP4302 and NHP3032) from the same geographic region; these Art-R lines also outcompeted a further <italic>kelch13</italic> wild-type, Art-R line, NHP4373. These results demonstrate that <italic>kelch13</italic> status of each parasite line alone does not predict relative fitness outcomes and point to the importance of understanding the components of their genetic backgrounds, co-segregating compensatory mutations which have varying capacities to abrogate the fitness costs observed of Art-R mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, wild-type <italic>kelch13</italic> Art-R parasites were both the most and least competitively fit parasites in this pilot study. It is interesting to consider whether our in vitro observation of a highly fit Art-R <italic>kelch13</italic> wild-type parasite (NHP4026) is being observed in the field. The relative frequency of wild-type <italic>kelch13</italic> is decreasing areas of Southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], however data is lacking regarding the resistance status of these parasites. Because there is no marker for non-<italic>kelch13</italic> Art-R, this form of resistance would escape easy detection.</p><p id="Par54">The <italic>kelch13</italic> mutations examined in this paper include a line with a C580Y-encoding SNP in the propeller domain, which is where most SNPs reside in Art-R parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The C580Y line used for this study is less competitively fit than the parasite isolates carrying E252Q and G538V, a finding that diverges from the general prediction that C580Y would prevail because this <italic>kelch13</italic> mutation has expanded dramatically in frequency and distribution under drug pressure in Southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A possible explanation for the less competitively fit C580Y line relative to the E252Q and G538V lines is a suboptimal genetic background of this lineage.</p><p id="Par55">The E252Q mutation lies outside of the K13 propeller region, consistent with the highest fitness cost being associated with mutations in the propeller domain, which could potentially explain why the E252Q line is more competitively fit relative to the parasite isolates carrying the C580Y and G538V. Many different haplotypes including C580Y <italic>kelch13</italic> have been associated with Art-R in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], but only one C580Y haplotype lineage, which emerged in 2008 in Western Cambodia, has outcompeted other haplotypes and spread to Thailand and southern Laos, indicative of a selective sweep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This particular C580Y line was isolated from a Thai patient in 2007, from a time and place in which C580Y mutants were very rare amongst artemisinin-resistant parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. E252Q was the predominant SNP at the time that the samples utilized in this study were collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], however, since 2010, the prevalence of C580Y and other SNPs has surpassed E252Q in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This could suggest that this particular C580Y line isolated in 2007 had not yet accumulated the necessary compensatory mutations (i.e. genetic background) required for competitively fitness.</p><p id="Par56">Distinct population genetic structures distinguish these regions across a relatively small geographic area; consequently, it is likely that the different genetic backgrounds have played important roles in the fitness and spread of Art-R parasites. The Thailand–Myanmar border region from which parasites for this study were isolated differs from the Cambodia–Laos–Thailand cluster of Art-R populations and also those from the China–Myanmar region. Therefore, it is also possible that the relatively low competitive fitness of the C580Y line in our study could be due to its lineage (<italic>kelch13</italic> haplotype along with its genome-wide background) that differs from the one that has spread across Western Cambodia and Thailand.</p><p id="Par57">Regardless of the exact reason for the fitness cost of the C580Y line used in this study, several recent studies have corroborated the findings from this study. A recent study comparing experimentally modified isogenic lines that differed only for the <italic>kelch13</italic> mutation determined that C580Y carries a greater competitive fitness burden than R561H compared directly in the same genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, using a similar approach, but in a different genetic background than that used by Nair et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], Straimer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] demonstrated that C580Y conveys significantly less fitness cost compared to either R539T or I543T. These seemingly conflicting study results could potentially be explained by the presence or absence of compensatory mutations in the genetic backgrounds.</p><p id="Par58">Genome-wide association studies are demonstrating the importance of gene combinations and complex genetic architecture of Art-R with the assumption that compensatory mutations are co-evolving with resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, discerning secondary resistance loci and loci involved in artemisinin partner drug resistance from fitness loci will require direct measures of fitness as outlined here. As an alternative, measuring fitness and drug phenotypes in the progeny of experimental genetic crosses between unique parasite lines can quantify the contribution of causal and compensatory loci to drug resistance phenotypes and fitness. This optimized in vitro competitive growth assay will allow us to use this approach to determine the genetic basis of the highly competitively fit NHP4026 parasite, including the components of fitness compensation pathways. The transitive nature of this phenotype measured using the optimized competitive growth assay will allow us to determine the relative fitness phenotypes of each of the recombinant progeny of a recent genetic cross involving NHP4026 × NF54-HT-GFP-luc to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The optimization of this assay to 96-well plates and the transitive nature of the phenotype makes population and linkage studies feasible, for example to dissect (and compare) genetic backgrounds of independently evolved Art-R <italic>kelch13</italic> lineages.</p><p id="Par59">Finally, the competitive growth experiments in this study were carried out in the absence of artemisinin drug pressure; future competitive growth studies will also include artemisinin drug pressure. This approach could highlight the extent of competitive release, in which resistant isolates, ordinarily outcompeted by sensitive parasites, overcome the fitness deficit in the presence of drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], as well as the possibility that set of fitness relationships among Art-R parasites varies depending on the presence of drug.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par60">Through the design and application of an optimized in vitro competitive growth assay, differences in competitive fitness of seven genetically distinct <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lines from Southeast Asia, both artemisinin-sensitive and resistant, were elucidated. It was determined that a <italic>kelch13</italic> wild-type, resistant line had the highest competitive fitness and that regional differences in the genetic structure of parasite populations may account for differences in the fitness of <italic>kelch13</italic> SNP associated resistant lines, as the results showed the C580Y resistant line to be the least fit Art-R <italic>kelch13</italic> SNP line. This methodology will allow the high-throughput implementation of competitive growth experiments to help understand the spread of artemisinin-resistant markers in populations and guide targeted therapy against infections.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge members of the Ferdig lab for helpful discussions.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>ART and KMV contributed equally to this work.

DNA samples amplified using primers for microsatellite markers were analysed with CEQ fragment analysis to determine the experimentally observed “measured” relative density ratio of each parasite in each of the known mixtures. The “measured” ratios were compared to the known (expected) “calculated” relative density ratios and plotted to create a standard curve for two parasites. This was repeated for a total of three repetitions. The standard curve (with a slope of 1.010 ± 0.01551 and an r<sup>2</sup> value of 0.9914) shows that this method of microsatellite marker analysis using fluorescent primers and fragment analysis can accurately measure a wide range of parasite densities. It also determined that DNA from a second parasite cloned line does not have any significant impact on the ability to quantify the relative density of parasite DNA from the first parasite cloned line.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3" xlink:title="Supplementary information"><media xlink:href="MediaObjects/12936_2019_2934_MOESM3_ESM.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Additional file 3.</bold> Consistency of competition outcomes between biological replicates of NHP4026 versus NF54. The throughput of this optimized competitive growth assays makes it much easier to set up technical replicates, and it also makes it easier to set up biological replicates. Four separate competitions (four biological replicates) of the NF54 versus NHP4026 competition were set up with three technical replicates per biological replicate. Dotted lines at y = 0.05 and y = 0.95 show when the winner of the competition was declared, and the competition was ended. (A) In every biological replicate, NHP4026 outcompeted NF54. The only differences between the biological replicates were the starting ratios (due to variability in counting parasitaemia to start competitions) and the day in which one isolate reached 95% of the population, ending the competition. Biological replicate 1 (NHP4026_1 and NF54_1) took ~ 54 days to complete, biological replicate 2 took ~ 20 days to complete, while biological replicates 3 and 4 took ~ 32 and ~ 38 days, respectively.

The improved throughput of this optimized 96-well plate assay allows thawing, synchronization, and set up of one biological replicate with three technical replicates of competitions between eight parasites (28 competitions) in approximately 10 days. Additional biological replicates can be set up using left over culture grown for an additional life cycle from the first biological replicate or new cultures can be thawed and set up in competitions in approximately 10 days. The time and reagents required for maintenance of plates is greatly reduced by the reduced volume compared to flask methods, allowing for multichannel pipetting for the dilution of parasitaemia and the decreased space required to store plates compared to flasks. The analysis of samples is made simpler and quicker by allowing samples to be easily stored until researchers want to analyse the samples, not requiring a DNA extraction, only using 1 μl of whole culture for the PCR, and a simple dilution and sample preparation to run samples on the CEQ for fragment analysis. While each competition might take a variable amount of time to win (when one parasite line reaches 95% of the population), all-on-all competitions of 28 parasites with three technical replicates and analysis can be done in 31–73 days.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM5" xlink:title="Supplementary information"><media xlink:href="MediaObjects/12936_2019_2934_MOESM5_ESM.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Additional file 5.</bold> Consistency between 5 ml and 96-well plate competition assays.
