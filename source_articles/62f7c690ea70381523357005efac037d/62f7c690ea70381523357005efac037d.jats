However, the antibiotic-resistant infections that are difficult to treat are becoming more and more common. The emergence of these strains is currently a global health crisis. Over 2 million people are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria annually in the USA alone, resulting in 23,000 deaths annually, on average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The wide spread use of antibiotics in the intensive care unit (ICU) is an important factor in the emergence of nosocomial infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Impairment of the host defenses is a key element in the pathogenesis of infection by these bacteria. However, the effects and the mechanisms of antibiotic-mediated changes in the host defense against bacteria invasion in critical patients are currently still unclear.</p><p id="Par6">The human gastro-intestinal tract is colonized by trillions of microorganisms which encompass hundreds of different species of bacteria and viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The intestinal epithelial cells express pattern recognition receptors that protect against antagonistic microbial invasion and maintain epithelial barriers in the presence of commensal microflora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A major downstream effect of toll-like receptor signaling is the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Paneth cells also limit bacterial penetration to the small intestinal antimicrobial barrier through synthesizing different antimicrobial peptides and proteins, such as enteric α-defensins (known as cryptdins in mice), lysozyme, RegIIIβ, RegIIIγ, RELMβ (resistin-like molecules β), and CRP-ductin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that is best known for mediating the carcinogenicity xenobiotic ligands. Recent study suggests that Ahr also plays an important physiological role in the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The expression of Ahr is critical for the maintenance, survival, and functioning of Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Ahr cooperates with Rorγt to induce the transcription of interleukin-22 (IL-22), which is essential for the clearance of <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Indole-3-aldehyde, a tryptophan catabolite produced by the microbiota, stimulates the ILCs through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor to induce the ILCs to produce IL-22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The regulatory mechanisms of the gut-lung axis and the role of the Ahr receptors of the intestinal mucosa in innate lung immunity have remained elusive.</p><p id="Par7">Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses via the regulation of leukocyte function and apoptosis. Overproduction of IL-6 results in immunological and hematological disorders. In addition, IL-6 induces inflammation by promoting T cell activation, adhesion molecule expression, and influencing leukocyte recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The majority of patients in the ICU are treated with strong antibiotics, which can have pervasive and long-term effects on the intestinal microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In an earlier study, we have demonstrated that antibiotic treatments reduced the total bacteria counts in the terminal ileum, but increased the translocation of injected pathogenic <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> due to a reduction in the mucosal bacterial killing activity and the expression of nondefensin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently, we also showed that dead <italic>L. salivarius</italic> or FOS feeding reversed antibiotic-induced lung defense impairment through the intestinal ROS/MyD88 pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The gut microbiota has been proven to enhance primary alveolar macrophage (AM) function and plays a protective role in the host defense against pneumococcal pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We hypothesize that Ahr ligands or dead <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> could be used to strengthen the lung defense against <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA)-induced pneumonia in ICU patients through ROS production and NF-κB activation from the intestine. Here, mice were used as a model in antibiotic treatment with or without PA-induced pneumonia to study the effects and mechanisms of the antibiotic treatment on lung defense mechanisms. There are three main objectives in this study: (1) To determine the effects and mechanisms of antibiotic treatments on lung defense mechanisms. (2) To determine whether Ahr ligands could reverse the inhibitory effects of antibiotics on lung defense. (3) To examine the involvement of Ahr and IKKβ of the intestine in the regulatory mechanisms of the gut on lung defense. In ICU patients, oral supplementation of Ahr ligands to reverse lung defense impairment caused by antibiotic treatments can potentially be a useful therapeutic treatment in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par8">We obtained specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6J mice from the National Laboratory Breeding and Research Center (NLBRC, Taipei, Taiwan).

Here we demonstrated that combined antibiotic treatments led to the impairment of the innate lung immune defenses against infection by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. There are multiple effects that account for this impairment. First, the antibiotic treatment increased the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia-induced bacterial counts in the lung tissue. Second, the antibiotic treatment induced the reduction of phagocytic activity, physiological activity, and peroxynitrite production of the AMs. Third, the antibiotic treatment increased ICAM and IL-6 expression in the lung. Altogether, our data suggest that antibiotic treatments reduces lung defense against pneumonia caused by PA through the reduction of phagocytic activity, physiological activity, and peroxynitrite production of the AMs. Our results highlight the possibility that broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment increases <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia in critically ill patients by reducing lung immune defense mechanisms.</p><p id="Par43">Recent breakthroughs in the understanding of the importance of the gut microbiome in both the maintenance of health and disease etiology have critical implications for respiratory and critical care medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Intestinal microbes not only contribute to the local host defenses against infections, but also modulate systemic immune responses (especially the lung) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) regulates both innate and adaptive immune responses by detecting a variety of small synthetic and natural chemicals, which act as its ligands. Tryptophan metabolites feeding stimulates intestinal mucosa immunity via the aryl hydrocarbon receptors (Ahr) and IL-22 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our results suggest that Ahr ligand supplementation enhanced the lung immune defense mechanism by increasing intestinal ROS and peroxynitrite production of AMs. The Ahr ligands supplementation has three main effects. First, it reverses the antibiotic treatment-induced reduction in Ahr expression of the intestinal mucosa. Second, it increased the peroxynitrite production, physiological activity, and phagocytic activity of the AMs. Third, it increased the ROS production of the intestinal mucosa. Moreover, it also reversed the antibiotic-enhanced ICAM and IL-6 expression and PA pneumonia-induced bacterial counts of the lung. Finally, IKKβ depletion in the gut abolished the stimulatory effects of Ahr ligands and dead <italic>L. plantarum</italic> feeding on Ahr expression of the intestine and peoxynitrite production of AMs. These results suggest that Ahr ligand supplementation reverses the antibiotic treatment-induced lung immune defense impairment through activating IKKβ/NF-κB in the intestine.</p><p id="Par44">ROS levels in the gut have been suggested to be closely related to the intestinal barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our finding of decreased DCFDA levels in the intestinal mucosa in the antibiotic treatment only group suggests that antibiotic treatment decreased the ROS levels in the gut. Tryptophan, indole, and dead <italic>L. plantarum</italic> feeding in mice receiving antibiotic treatment significantly increased the DCFDA levels in the intestinal mucosa. Superoxide and nitric oxide are essential components in the synthesis of microbicidal compounds (e.g., peroxynitrite), in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our finding of decreased peroxynitrite production of AMs in the antibiotic only treatment group suggests that antibiotic treatment reduces phagocytic activity of AMs by decreasing the peroxynitrite production of the AMs. Taken altogether, antibiotic treatment impairs lung immune defense through decreasing ROS production in the gut mucosa and the peroxynitrite production of AMs, and through the subsequent reduction of the phagocytic activity of the AMs. Moreover, oral feeding with tryptophan, indole, and dead <italic>L. plantarum</italic> in mice receiving antibiotic treatment significantly increased the peroxynitrite production and phagocytic activity of the AMs. These results indicate that the Ahr ligands enhance the lung immune defense mechanism by increasing the intestinal ROS production and peroxynitrite production of the AMs. Our study demonstrates clearly a gut–lung axis in the antibiotic model, and establishes a likely mechanism for pulmonary immunomodulation through the intestinal mucosa-mediated signaling pathways. The increasing ROS production of intestine, peroxynitrite production, activity, and phagocytic activity of the AMs brought on by Ahr ligands supplementation further provides support for the regulatory mechanism of the gut on the immune defense system in the lung.</p><p id="Par45">We observed that antibiotic treatment significantly increased the plasma IL-6 levels as compared to that in the control group. Tryptophan, dead <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, and indole feeding in mice receiving antibiotic treatment significantly decreased the IL-6 levels in the plasma. Previously, we have found that combined antibiotic treatment after thermal injury induced a substantial tenfold increase of IL-6 levels in the blood compared with the burn group. Oral supplementation with dead <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the antibiotic treatment group significantly decreased IL-6 levels in the blood compared with thermal injury with antibiotic treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These results suggest that IL-6 plays an important role in the regulatory mechanisms of gut on lung immunity.

However, antibiotics only, antibiotic with tryptophan, and antibiotic with dead <italic>L. plantarum</italic> treatments did not change plasma IL-6 levels in <italic>Vil</italic>-<italic>Cre/Ikkβ</italic><sup><italic>F/Δ</italic></sup> mice. These results indicate that the IKKβ of the intestine is critical in inducing plasma IL-6 levels during antibiotics treatment.</p><p id="Par46">The involvements of the intestinal IKK activity/NF-κB activation on the lung defense and its related mechanisms have not been well characterized. We used <italic>Vil</italic>-<italic>Cre/Ikkβ</italic><sup><italic>F/Δ</italic></sup> mice in antibiotic treatment experiment to examine the involvement of intestinal IKK activity/NF-κB activation in the lung defense mechanism. Previously, we have demonstrated that germ-free mice showed a significant decrease of NF-κB binding activity of intestinal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our present data showed that antibiotic treatment significantly decreased binding activity of NF-κB and Ahr expression of the intestinal mucosa. Both results suggested that binding activity of NF-κB of the intestinal mucosa is closely related with microbiota in the intestine. IKKβ depletion in the gut abolished the stimulatory effects of Ahr ligands on Ahr expression of the intestine. These results suggest that IKKβ/NF-κB activation plays an important role in microbiota-induced Ahr expression of the intestinal mucosa. <italic>Vil</italic>-<italic>Cre/Ikkβ</italic><sup><italic>F/Δ</italic></sup> mice demonstrated a significant increase in PA pneumonia-induced bacterial counts in the lung, and a significant decrease of the phagocytic activity of AMs compared to <italic>Ikkβ</italic><sup><italic>F/Δ</italic></sup> mice.

These results indicate that the intestinal IKK activity/NF-κB activation of the intestine are crucial for the maintenance of peroxynitrite production, phagocytic activity of AMs, and lung defense against bacterial infection. Ahr can bind the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated β cells (NF-κB), thereby activating the expression of NF-κB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The antibiotics only, antibiotics with tryptophan, or antibiotics with dead <italic>L. plantarum</italic> treatments did not change the protein expression of Ahr and RELMβ of the intestinal mucosa, or the peroxynitrite production of AMs in <italic>Vil</italic>-<italic>Cre/Ikkβ</italic><sup><italic>F/Δ</italic></sup>. These results suggest that antibiotic treatment reduces Ahr expression of the intestine and subsequently the lung defense mechanism through the IKKβ of the intestine. Ahr ligands increased peroxynitrite production of the AMs and lung defense against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection through IKKβ/NF-κB activation in the intestine. Altogether, we demonstrated that NF-κB activation in the intestine plays an important role in the lung immune defense mechanisms. Stimulation of IKKβ/NF-κB activation of the intestine with Ahr ligands could be a new therapeutic strategy in enhancing lung defense mechanisms in patients receiving antibiotic treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">Our study contributes to a better understanding by highlighting the inhibitory effect of antibiotic treatment on lung defense mechanism and the stimulatory effect of Ahr ligands on lung immunity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Antibiotic treatment decreases the intestinal Ahr expression, ROS production, and NF-κB activation in the intestinal mucosa. The decrease in intestinal NF-κB activation results in the reduction of ROS production and peroxynitrite production of the AMs. This further reduces the phagocytic activity of AMs and lung defense against infection by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Ahr ligands and dead <italic>L. plantarum</italic> treatments increase Ahr expression, ROS production, and IKKβ/NF-κB activation of the intestinal mucosa, peroxynitrite production, and the phagocytic activity of AMs. Ahr ligands reverse the antibiotic-induced lung defense mechanism through the induction of intestinal IKKβ/NF-κB activation and intestinal ROS production.
