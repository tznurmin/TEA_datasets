It was the first organism found to produce biological ice nuclei (IN), being able to freeze supercooled water with exceptional efficiency at temperatures above −10 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The IN activity of this organism originates from a large protein situated at the cell’s outer membrane, which forms multimeric clusters that structure water into an ice-like array promoting its phase change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Homologs of this protein, called InaZ, have since been identified in other ecologically similar species also active as IN. This trait has been linked to the increased susceptibility to frost damage above −5 °C of plants harboring populations of these bacteria on their leaves, a significant concern to agriculture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The particular ability of <italic>P. syringae</italic> and similar organisms to form efficient IN has been long suggested to possibly influence atmospheric processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Glaciation, the freezing of the droplets that compose clouds, is an important mechanism leading to precipitation (including hail formation), and is largely determined by IN particles present in suspension in the air. Due to the reduced vapor pressure over ice crystals than supercooled liquid water, frozen particles can accumulate water and grow to sizes large enough to start the precipitation process inside the cloud<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This is known as the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process, and its significance is evidenced by observations such as that the ice phase of clouds is the main source of rain in continental areas across the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. An additional mechanism that can amplify the influence of IN is the Hallett-Mossop process, the rapid multiplication by orders of magnitude of secondary ice crystal fragments caused by the riming and splintering of primary ice surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Since this occurs predominantly between −3 and −8 °C, temperatures where biological IN are the major active nuclei present in the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, this has been proposed as another potential contribution that organisms like <italic>P. syringae</italic> can have for the precipitation cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In addition to cloud glaciation, microbial cells can also exhibit activity as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in warm clouds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These aerosol particles are essential for the condensation of water vapor into the liquid droplets that make up clouds. Interestingly, besides their IN activity, studies with bacteria of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus have also shown their ability to produce biosurfactants that can act as highly efficient CCN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Further research of microbial life in the atmosphere also includes the effects of cells on cloud chemistry, particularly in relation to the metabolism of organic compounds in its aqueous phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Multiple works have reported the presence of cultivable <italic>P. syringae</italic> and other ice nucleating bacteria in rain and snow samples (Morris, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and Šantl-Temkiv, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, for example). Recently, Stopelli, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> isolated with selective culture media IN-active <italic>P. syringae</italic> from snow collected at an altitude of 3,580 m at Jungfraujoch, Switzerland. Furthermore, these organisms have also been isolated directly from clouds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Members of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus were the most frequently identified bacterial isolates from cloud water samples collected at an altitude of 1,465 m at the puy de Dôme summit in France between 2007 and 2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A number of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains were also isolated from clouds and rain at the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, although those did not present IN activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These evidences point to the widespread distribution of these bacteria in the atmosphere and support their relationship with clouds and the precipitation cycle.</p><p id="Par6">Besides <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, a concentration of about 10<sup>4</sup> total bacterial cell numbers per cubic meter of air is estimated to be found typically over land, though this figure may significantly change with the altitude, weather, season, and the underlying ecosystem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Particles with the size of bacteria have a relatively long residence time in the air, on the order of days, during which they have the potential to cross long distances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Effective dispersal trough this medium is, however, conditioned to cell survival as aerosols, which is a considerable challenge in this situation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The viability of aerosolized bacteria can be severely limited by atmospheric factors. Particularly, dehydration and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light have been found to be the major barriers for successful aerial transportation of microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Even inside clouds, cells are still subjected to UV, and additionally to low temperatures, freezing, and chemical stresses such as low pH and oxidizing species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. An important means of escape from this situation may be through precipitation, which can be facilitated by the IN activity of the biological particle, as mentioned above. Both field measurements and laboratory studies have shown that cells with this activity can be preferentially precipitated from clouds in this manner, more so than non-nucleating particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In this way, ice nucleation could be a valuable feature for the surviving airborne bacteria to return to the ground and again be able to multiply and propagate.</p><p id="Par8">A few previous studies explored the response of <italic>P. syringae</italic> to simulated solar radiation in the context of atmospheric survival. Attard, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> reported a reduction in viability and a somewhat small impact in IN activity of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains after prolonged exposure to UV-A light. In contrast, Joly, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> measured no loss of viability for two <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains exposed to a source emitting UV-B, but with a much reduced UV-A output compared to the proportion in which this wavelength range is present in the solar spectrum. IN were not evaluated in this work. Here, we improve upon these findings with a more detailed investigation of the effects of different UV ranges at a series of fluences on cell survival and ice nucleation.</p><p id="Par9">Two strains of <italic>P. syringae</italic> were used in this study: pv. <italic>syringae</italic> IBSBF 281<sup>T</sup> (pathovar type strain) and pv. <italic>garcae</italic> IBSBF 158, previously reported to be IN-active by Gonçalves and Massambani<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In addition to UV, the strains were also tested against desiccation at different relative humidity (RH) values (33% and &lt;5%), a still much less understood factor for these bacteria in this context. In this manner, the aim of the experiments was to simulate particularly important<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> individual conditions that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> would be exposed to in the high atmosphere that could constrain their dispersion through the air. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that both tested stress factors, solar light and dehydration, can also be found at different degrees on their natural plant surface habitat. We compared the effects of distinct UV radiation sources: narrow-band UV-C and UV-B lamps, commonly used in photobiological studies, and UV-A + UV-B from a solar simulator. Previously, microorganisms have been shown to exhibit significantly different responses to these UV sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, making this a novel, relevant exploration of <italic>P. syringae</italic> resilience. Additionally, a strain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, another Gram-negative gamma-proteobacterium like <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, but non-ice nucleation active and not a common inhabitant of plant surfaces, was used for comparison. With its status as a model organism, while not being expected to present substantial tolerance to environmental stresses present outside its usual habitat in the mammalian gut, <italic>E. coli</italic> is widely used for distinguishing the resistance of bacteria, often as a non-tolerant reference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

This range of Solar radiation (&lt;280 nm) does not reach Earth’s lower atmosphere (the troposphere), being completely absorbed at the stratosphere. Despite that, the 254 nm wavelength produced by low-pressure mercury lamps is widely used to assess the effects of UV on bacteria in laboratory studies.

In agreement to that, Wang, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> measured a more severe DNA damage in plants at an altitude of 1,700 m than at 300 m.

Thus, the survival curves presented for UV-B and “environmental” UV cannot be directly compared on the basis of the measured fluences, considering the Vilber Loumart radiometer’s probes read a spectral range, not a single wavelength.</p><p id="Par22">Joly, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> exposed two <italic>P. syringae</italic> isolated from cloud water for 10 hours to total final fluences of 85.7 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> of UV-A and 27 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> of UV-B at 5 °C.

UV-B measurements (if significant) were not provided, but the final calculated UV-A exposure was of almost 5,000 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>.

Taking the UV-B as the most biologically relevant radiation range for comparison, <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains can be expected to tolerate hours of direct sunlight exposure, even without attenuating factors such as association to cell clusters, mineral particles or organic fragments. Certainly, those factors can become increasingly important for survival at higher altitudes and for longer periods.</p><p id="Par24">The IN activity of 281 was not reduced for cells irradiated for two hours under the solar simulator.

These authors discuss how dead bacteria could maintain their IN activity as long as cell integrity is not disrupted, preserving the large ice nucleation protein aggregates on the cells’ outer membranes. In fact, this is what was observed for cells completely inactivated by UV-C exposure, with again only a relatively small effect measured for 158 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">Summarizing the UV results, our work reveals that the biological response to commonly used laboratory UV sources is a poor representation of what is found with the solar spectrum, and that while UV can be a serious limitation to the dispersal of <italic>P. syringae</italic> through the atmosphere, these bacteria are adapted to endure periods of complete exposure to sunlight.

Similarly to the UV (see Supplementary Discussion), DNA repair and antioxidant systems should be valuable features for bacterial survival under this condition. In the environment, tolerance to desiccation could possibly be achieved by activation of the aerosolized bacteria as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), enabling hydration of the cells from water vapor harnessed from the air.

The experiments were conducted in a manner so as to minimize these artifacts, exposing cells as thin layers to rapidly equilibrate with the RH controlling agents, but masses of natural bacterial populations are probably better adapted to endure this stress. Monier and Lindow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> have previously shown that cells grown as aggregates over leaf surfaces present an increased desiccation tolerance with larger cells clusters, but artificially generated aggregates did not exhibit such effect. An explanation for that is the lack of locally-produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which are formed by cells grown together as groups, but would not be extensively produced under the laboratory culture conditions used. In addition to this point, the osmotic shock of rehydration after desiccation under the tested laboratory conditions could be a significant stress by itself. As reported by Kosanke <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, a slow rehydration protocol can increase the survival of dried bacteria. Despite this effect being relatively minor when compared to the large range of survivals measured in this work, it could have also played a role in the results obtained.</p><p id="Par28">Despite its low tolerance to desiccation, the IN activity of 281 was relatively well preserved after desiccation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The measured decrease by roughly 30 times in IN concentration can possibly be attributed to cell membrane disruption during dehydration affecting the IN protein clusters. Its hydrated controls maintained the full typical IN concentration of this strain (about 10<sup>−1</sup> per cell). In contrast, the IN activity of the more desiccation tolerant strain 158 was unexpectedly reduced even in the hydrated controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) when compared to its typical IN concentration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The large aggregates of InaZ proteins that form at the cells outer membranes, which are essential for forming efficient IN active at relatively high temperatures such as −5 °C, are known to be particularly heat sensitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Even though the temperature of 20 °C at which the hydrated and desiccated cells were kept at during these experiments were not expected to be detrimental to biological IN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, further tests with 158 were performed at 4 °C (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref><bold>)</bold>. This could not recover the typical IN concentration for this strain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), signifying some other mechanism contributes to the instability of the nuclei in this case where the cells are not actively growing and their metabolism, including protein synthesis, is probably reduced.

Precipitation events may increase further rain by seeding the atmosphere with suspended biological particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, and the likely enhanced survival and IN preservation when compared to dry, desiccating conditions may be a key step enabling this cycle. Further studies will be necessary to make clear how the biological response of bacterial cells to environmental stresses can have further consequences to the ecosystem they inhabit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Strains, media, growth conditions, and survival quantification</title><p id="Par30">The tested <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> belonged to the strains IBSBF 281<sup>T</sup> (=NCPPB 281, ATCC 19310; pv. <italic>syringae</italic> type strain; isolated from <italic>Syringa vulgaris</italic>) and IBSBF 158 (pv. <italic>garcae</italic>; isolated from <italic>Coffea arabica</italic>, where it causes the brown spot disease on leaves).

This coating was previously applied as a 2% solution of paraffin in xylene, with the solvent removed by heat over a hot plate. The tray was covered with a transparent acrylic lid sealed on the borders by a ring made of EVA foam sheet and held in place by binder clips. This set was then positioned almost totally immersed in a low temperature circulating bath (Neslab LT-50, Newington, USA) filled with 96% ethanol. Temperature was monitored with a submerged mercury thermometer. From −2 °C, the bath temperature was reduced in 1 °C stages, which were held for at least 5 minutes. At each stage, the number of frozen drops was scored. IN concentration was calculated with the following equation adapted from Vali<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, as commonly used for microbiological studies (e.g., Joly, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>): c(T) = [ln (N) − ln (N − N(T))]/A, where “c(T)” is the number of cumulative active IN per cell at temperature “T”, “N” is the number of drops tested, “N(T)” is the number of frozen drops at temperature “T”, and “A” is the number of cells per drop (determined by CFU counting from initial population). All experiments were replicated at least 4 times. Measured IN activity values are presented as means of the replicates, with error bars representing standard deviations. To determine significant differences, Mann-Whitney U tests and Bonferroni corrections were performed with PAST (v3.21) software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> (<ext-link xlink:href="http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/" ext-link-type="url">http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>UV irradiation experiments</title><p id="Par32">UV-C irradiation was done with a Philips TUV-20W low-pressure mercury lamp with main emission line at 254 nm. UV-B was provided by a set of mercury lamps (two LightTech Narrow Band UV-B 20 W and one Philips TL 20 W/01 RS) with main emission line at 312 nm. A solar simulator (Oriel Sol-UV-2, Bozeman, USA) with a 1,000 Watt xenon arc lamp was used for the “environmental UV” irradiation experiments. This source’s output covers partially the UV-B and UV-A ranges with a spectrum similar to the one found at directly Sun-exposed environments on Earth (with negligible UV-C), except most of the visible light is removed by an optical filter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Irradiation intensities and fluences were measured by a radiometer (Vilber Loumart RMX-3W, Marne-la-Vallée, France) with photocells specific to wavelength ranges centered in 254 nm at the UV-C (CX-254), 312 nm at the UV-B (CX-312), and 365 nm at the UV-A (CX-365).</p><p id="Par33">For the UV-C and UV-B assays, cultures were diluted 100-fold in saline solution to a final volume of 8 ml in autoclaved 7 cm diameter glass petri dishes (without the lids). The samples were irradiated under orbital shaking while the fluences were monitored in real time by photocells placed next to the dishes. Aliquots taken at fluence intervals were diluted and plated for survival quantification by enumeration of CFU. For the “environmental” UV experiments, the samples were irradiated on top of a frozen foam block, also under shaking, so as to control their temperature to near 0 °C. This was done during these more prolonged exposures to avoid evaporation and to prevent excessive heating – which can itself affect the cells’ IN by leading to the disaggregation of the ice nucleation protein clusters on the cells’ outer membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The intensities were measured beforehand as 75.5 W/m² for the UV-A and 48.7 W/m² for the UV-B, at the ranges read by the radiometer (centered on 365 and 312 nm). Aliquots from the exposed samples were then taken after determined time intervals, corresponding to UV-A and UV-B fluences which could be calculated afterwards from the intensity values.</p><p id="Par34">Separate experiments were performed to test the effects of UV over the cells’ IN. Longer exposures were used in these assays since preliminary trials showed no effects of smaller fluences on IN activity. With the solar simulator, samples were exposed for 120 minutes at the same UV intensities as before, equivalent to a total 545 kJ/m² of UV-A and 348 kJ/m² of UV-B (at the ranges read by the radiometer), twice as much as the largest fluence of the survival tests. In this case, the diluted cultures were exposed as 2 ml volumes in 3 cm diameter dishes, allowing more samples to be placed below the source’s focus at the same time. The control samples, “0 min”, were aliquoted from the dishes before the beginning of the experiments and stored until the end of the irradiation when their IN activity was quantified parallel to the “120 min” samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Desiccation experiments</title><p id="Par35">Desiccation assays were performed with 10 μl volumes taken directly from the cultures and deposited in the internal wall of horizontally positioned autoclaved 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. The tubes were then placed inside sealed recipients containing either silica gel beads or water-saturated MgCl<sub>2</sub>. These treatments were used to provide controlled relative humidity (RH) values below 5% and of about 33%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. A &lt;5% RH is typical for very high altitudes, considering water vapor sources at the ground surface. Hydrated controls were prepared by adding 10 μl from the cultures to a total 1 ml in tubes with saline solution (10<sup>−2</sup> dilution). All samples were stored for 6 days inside an incubator at 20 °C. During this, the temperatures were monitored with mercury thermometers and were found to remain stable. At the end of this period, the dried samples were resuspended with 1 ml saline solution (10<sup>−2</sup> dilution in relation to the cultures). Along with the hydrated control cell suspensions, these tubes were diluted for survival determination by plating and for IN quantification. Survival was calculated relative to initial controls aliquoted from the cultures, plated before the beginning of each experiment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was sponsored by the Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education – CAPES, the São Paulo Research Foundation – FAPESP (Projects 2016/06160-8 and 2012/18936-0), the Microsfera project (407816/2013-5) of the Brazilian Antarctic Program (ProAntar), the Brazilian National Council of Technological and Scientific Development – CNPq (CNPq 424367/2016-5), INCT-Criosfera (CNPq 028306/2009), and the University of São Paulo – USP, through the Brazilian Research Unity in Astrobiology – NAP/Astrobio.
