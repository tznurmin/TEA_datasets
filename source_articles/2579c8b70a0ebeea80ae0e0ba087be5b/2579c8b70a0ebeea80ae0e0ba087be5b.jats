In this study, we conducted superovulation, IVF, and knock out and knock in using IVF rat embryos. We found that superovulation effectively occurred in the synchronized oestrus cycle and with anti-inhibin antiserum treatment in immature rats, including the Brown Norway rat, which is a very difficult rat strain to superovulate. Next, we collected superovulated oocytes under anaesthesia, and offspring derived from IVF embryos were obtained from all of the rat strains that we examined. When the <italic>tyrosinase</italic> gene was targeted by electroporation in these embryos, both alleles were disrupted with 100% efficiency. Furthermore, we conducted long DNA fragment knock in using adeno-associated virus and found that the knock-in litter was obtained with high efficiency (33.3–47.4%). Thus, in this study, we developed methods to allow the simple and efficient production of model rats.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MEXT |

(<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>) was first used as a laboratory animal in Europe during the 1850s and it was the first mammalian species to be domesticated for scientific purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The size and simple handling of rats are major characteristics that may have motivated the selection of rats for early animal experiments in studies of breeding, behaviour, psychology, nutrition, endocrinology, genetics, and other research. Moreover, comprehensive database platforms related to laboratory rats have been developed, such as the National BioResource Project-Rat in Japan and Rat Genome Database in the USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Rats have contributed greatly to the development of therapeutic agents and regimens as human disease models, but their use in gene modification research is not as advanced as that of mice because of difficulties conducting fundamental developmental engineering techniques such as superovulation, <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF), and pluripotent stem cell manipulation. Superovulation is one of the most important techniques for the effective production of genetically modified rats. However, only an average of 2.2 oocytes per rat can be recovered using superovulation methods, even in the valuable inbred Brown Norway (BN) strain, where over 90% of its genome sequence has been determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Mouse reproduction techniques such as IVF and embryo manipulation were established in the 1970s, while the development of gene knock-out (KO) mice using embryonic stem cells occurred before 1990; both are critical tools for understanding gene functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, the first generation of gene KO rats were obtained via homologous recombination in 2010, which was almost 20 years after the production of KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Recently developed synthetic sequence-specific nucleases (gene editors), such as zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR/Cas) system, and engineered mega-nucleases have all been used to genetically modify the rat genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Several studies have reported the successful production of rat offspring by IVF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, but all of the rats with genomic modifications produced via micromanipulation, electroporation, and the genome editing via oviductal nucleic acids delivery system (GONAD) were derived by <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization (mating) rather than IVF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, which reflects the difficulty of efficiently producing rats using IVF.</p><p id="Par3">In this study, we successfully developed methods for the efficient and simple (free of micromanipulation) production of KO and knock-in (KI) rats using superovulation and for obtaining IVF-derived oocytes in several rat strains, including BN. These methods facilitate the production of genetically modified rats by researchers who require model rats.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Oestrus cycle synchronization and inhibin suppression enhanced superovulation in several rat strains</title><p id="Par4">Superovulation techniques must be established for a wide range of rat strains in order to develop effective reproduction techniques. In previous studies, superovulation was generally induced in rats using pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, it is well-known that the usual superovulation treatment is not effective in some strains. Taketsuru <italic>et al</italic>. reported that for BN—which is a representative strain and its genomic sequence has been determined as that for the rat—only 2.2 ± 1.4 oocytes could be obtained from sexually mature females (8–13 weeks of age) using the conventional treatment (PMSG–hCG injection)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To overcome this problem, we evaluated the previously reported treatments that are known to accelerate superovulation, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., oestrus cycle synchronization (administration of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)) and passive immunoneutralization of endogenous inhibin (administration of anti-inhibin serum (AIS)), in immature female rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. When superovulation was induced by injecting PSMG-hCG into immature BN rats, 14.3 ± 3.9 oocytes were collected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which suggests that the immature BN rats ovulated more effectively than the adult BN rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. When AIS was applied simultaneously with PMSG and hCG (AIS/PMSG–hCG) in immature BN rats, 19.9 ± 4.5 oocytes were collected. After oestrus cycle synchronization was induced by LHRH treatment and the injection of both PMSG and hCG (LHRH-PMSG-hCG), 22.3 ± 3.7 oocytes were collected. Moreover, superovulation after synchronizing the oestrous cycle with LHRH and inhibin suppression (LHRH-AIS/PMSG-hCG) allowed us to collect 42.0 ± 3.7 oocytes from immature BN rats. No significant differences were detected, but oestrus cycle synchronization had positive effects on superovulation in the Wistar, F344, Long-Evans (LE), and Sprague Dawley (SD) strains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Thus, treatment with LHRH and AIS to stimulate superovulation was employed in our subsequent experiments.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Changes in the number of oocytes collected from oviducts of BN females that superovulated after the injection of LHRH, AIS, PMSG, and hCG.

Several studies have shown that the cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs) need to be collected immediately after sacrificing female rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, the oviductal ampullae were removed under anaesthesia to avoid prolonged manipulation after sacrifice. To evaluate the effect on the IVF rate of reduced glutathione (GSH), which is an enhancer of fertilization by frozen–thawed sperm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, the COCs were placed in a drop of human tubular fluid (HTF) medium with or without GSH and then inseminated with pre-incubated sperm (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The IVF rate was evaluated based on the whole stained mount and it varied in the range of 55.2–98.3% among the rat strains examined.

In this study, we obtained four major findings. First, we achieved superovulation in several rat strains, including BN, which usually yields a low number of oocytes. Second, these oocytes are suitable for producing offspring by IVF. Third, KO rats could be obtained efficiently from IVF embryos by electroporation. Finally, the IVF embryos were effective for generating KI rats by AAV transfection. These simple and efficient methods for producing model rats will contribute greatly to their development as human disease models.</p><p id="Par11">BN is one of the most important inbred rat strains and the genome sequence of the rat was obtained from the BN strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, the average number of natural mating derived BN offspring is low and superovulation is also difficult in this strain, thereby making it unsuitable for model animal production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Indeed, Taketsuru <italic>et al</italic>. reported that it is very difficult to induce superovulation in sexually mature BN rats. However, several studies have demonstrated that efficient superovulation can be achieved using immature females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In the mouse, it was confirmed that the number of oocytes can also be increased by synchronizing the oestrus cycle and treating with AIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In rats, it is known that synchronization can be achieved by administering LHRH rather than progesterone, and even in immature rats, the timing of ovulation can be adjusted using LHRH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that the frequency of ovulation increased when we used immature BN rats. Moreover, the administration of both LHRH and AIS synergistically increased superovulation in BN rats. However, treatment with LHRH had only slight positive effects on ovulation in the Wistar, F344, LE, and SD strains.</p><p id="Par12">Clearly, successful IVF has been achieved in rats in previous studies and this technique is feasible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, despite the large number of reports of successful genome editing, all were achieved using fertilized embryos obtained from natural mating, thereby strongly suggesting that it is difficult to obtain suitable offspring via IVF. Aoto <italic>et al</italic>. stressed the importance of collecting oocytes as soon as possible after euthanasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, in this study, we obtained offspring by IVF from the strains where the oocytes were collected under anaesthesia, and we were subsequently able to successfully achieve highly efficient genome editing in IVF embryos obtained in this manner. However, although the fertilization rate was very high, the birth rate was less than 30%, so we recognize that this IVF technique needs to be improved further for the availability of frozen–thawed IVF embryos. Modifying the zona pellucida using GSH is known to be effective in mice but the effects differ among strains of rats. Thus, it may be necessary to identify the optimal conditions for each rat strain in terms of the GSH concentration and processing time.</p><p id="Par13">The elimination of <italic>Tyr</italic> has been used frequently for determining the feasibility of genome editing in many animal species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

In the present study, when we disrupted the <italic>Tyr</italic> gene in IVF embryos using the same gRNA, 89 of the 89 offspring obtained were albino (=100%), and we confirmed that all of the pups examined (46/46) were biallelically mutated. A high genome editing efficiency using IVF embryos was also demonstrated based on the targeted disruption of the <italic>Rosa26</italic> site and the <italic>Tyr</italic> of Crlj:WI, where knock in led to biallelic indel mutations in all non-KI offspring (Tables <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>, Figs <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6e</xref>).

As a result, this condition was much more effective for IVF embryos than naturally fecundated embryos. In previous studies, genome editing was conducted with embryos obtained by <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization, so these embryos experienced a developmental time lag after their fertilization in each female. Moreover, the GONAD method has a restriction of oocyte collection because the cumulus cells must be loosened to some extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.
