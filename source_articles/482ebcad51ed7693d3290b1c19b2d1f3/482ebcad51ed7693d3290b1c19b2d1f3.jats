Combination therapies offer the best chance of disease control; however, the design of successful combination strategies requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underpinning CVA21 efficacy, in particular, the role of CVA21 anti-tumor immunity. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the ability of CVA21 to induce human anti-tumor immunity, and identify the cellular mechanism responsible.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This study utilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells from i) healthy donors, ii) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients, and iii) patients taking part in the STORM clinical trial, who received intravenous CVA21; patients receiving intravenous CVA21 were consented separately in accordance with local institutional ethics review and approval. Collectively, these blood samples were used to characterize the development of innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses following CVA21 treatment.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">An Initial characterization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, collected from cancer patients following intravenous infusion of CVA21, confirmed that CVA21 activated immune effector cells in patients. Next, using hematological disease models which were sensitive (Multiple Myeloma; MM) or resistant (AML) to CVA21-direct oncolysis, we demonstrated that CVA21 stimulated potent anti-tumor immune responses, including: 1) cytokine-mediated bystander killing; 2) enhanced natural killer cell-mediated cellular cytotoxicity; and 3) priming of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, with specificity towards known tumor-associated antigens. Importantly, immune-mediated killing of both MM and AML, despite AML cells being resistant to CVA21-direct oncolysis, was observed. Upon further examination of the cellular mechanisms responsible for CVA21-induced anti-tumor immunity we have identified the importance of type I IFN for NK cell activation, and demonstrated that both ICAM-1 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells were key mediators of this response.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">This work supports the development of CVA21 as an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of both AML and MM. Additionally, the data presented provides an important insight into the mechanisms of CVA21-mediated immunotherapy to aid the development of clinical biomarkers to predict response and rationalize future drug combinations.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Oncolytic viruses</kwd><kwd>Coxsackievirus A21</kwd><kwd>Plasmacytoid DC</kwd><kwd>Innate immunity</kwd><kwd>Adaptive immunity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">A13244 and C16708</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund </institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">KKL1071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Errington-Mais</surname><given-names>Fiona</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Yorkshire Cancer Research</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002653</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">L374RA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Errington-Mais</surname><given-names>Fiona</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40425_2019_Article_632.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine &amp;

Moreover, a recent clinical report demonstrating that OVT can improve the efficacy of the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint antibody, pembrolizumab, increases their potential clinical applicability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) can utilize two distinct mechanisms to induce their anti-tumor effects, namely: 1) direct cytotoxicity (oncolysis) following replication and lytic killing of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and 2) induction of anti-tumor immunity, which can be mediated by innate and adaptive immune mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Specifically, OVs alter the tumor microenvironment through the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a reduction in immunosuppressive factors, such as VEGF and IL-10. Furthermore, OVs enhance natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and stimulate the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) through the release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), with OVs providing the immunological “danger” signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. TAAs are subsequently processed by antigen-presenting cells (APC) and presented to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, or cross-presented to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, to promote an adaptive immune response, including immunological memory, against the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite numerous efforts to enhance the direct lytic potential of OVT, including suppression of host immune responses, the induction of anti-tumor immunity has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for long-term clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The <italic>Kuykendall</italic> strain of coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21) was manufactured to clinical grade (CAVATAK®) by Viralytics Ltd. and was recently acquired by Merck/MSD. CVA21 has been tested in a number of clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and, like Imlygic®, CAVATAK® has yielded promising results in the treatment of melanoma and other solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; a Phase I clinical trial (STORM; Systemic Treatment Of Resistant Metastatic disease) of intravenously administered CAVATAK® in combination with pembrolizumab is ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. CVA21 may cause mild upper respiratory tract infection in immunocompetent adults and approximately 15% of the population possess pre-existing antibodies against CVA21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. CVA21, an enterovirus belonging to the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and utilizes Decay Accelerating Factor (DAF) to bind to host cells and Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1) for internalization. Thus, overexpression of ICAM-1, observed on many malignantly transformed cells, can serve as a predictor of tumor cell susceptibility to CVA21-mediated oncolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the inability of CVA21 to infect mouse cells has limited testing of its immunotherapeutic potential in immune-competent pre-clinical animal models.</p><p id="Par28">Currently, OVT remains relatively under-investigated in the context of hematological malignancies with the majority of studies focusing on their direct lytic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As such, the role for OV-induced immunotherapy, in potentially immunocompromised patients, is less clear. To date, preclinical studies have evaluated a small selection of OVs for the treatment of AML, including myxoma virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], reovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; however, disappointingly, only one OV, VSV genetically modified to express IFN-β and sodium iodide symporter genes, has progressed to early clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. By contrast, the role for OVs in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) is more established with multiple clinical trials ongoing or completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Both AML and MM are in need of novel therapeutic interventions which are safe and well-tolerated, such as OVT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, we examined the immunotherapeutic potential of CVA21 against AML, which was relatively non-permissive to CVA21 infection and oncolysis, and MM, which was sensitive to CVA21-induced oncolysis. This study provides pivotal insight into: 1) the potential for CVA21-induced anti-tumor immunity against hematological malignancies; 2) the immunotherapeutic properties of CVA21; and 3) the cellular requirements for CVA21-induced anti-tumor immunity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture and patient samples</title><p id="Par29">All cell lines were grown according to ATCC/ECACC recommendations and ICAM-1-expressing KG-1 cells (ICAM-1/KG-1) were generated using lentiviral transduction.</p><p id="Par30">Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), obtained from healthy volunteers or leukocyte apheresis cones (National Health Service Blood and Transplant), were isolated using Lymphoprep™ (Fresenius-Kabi AS, Halden, Norway) density-gradient centrifugation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. PBMC were used at 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and PBMC-conditioned medium (CM), collected 48 h after CVA21 treatment, was stored at − 20 °C prior to use. For type I IFN neutralisation, PBMC were pre-incubated for 30 mins with polyclonal antibodies prior to addition of CVA21 for 24 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For ICAM-1 blockade, PBMCs were either treated with 10 μg/mL LEAF™ purified anti-human ICAM-1-blocking antibody, a mouse IgG1-isotype control antibody (both BioLegend), or left untreated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the PBMC were exposed to CVA21 for 24 h, before evaluation of NK cell activation and cytokine secretion.</p><p id="Par31">Blood samples were obtained from patients diagnosed with AML or patients taking part in the STORM Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02043665/Keynote-200/VLA009A) following additional informed consent.

Indeed, we did observe a modest increase in ICAM-1 expression on cells treated with CVA21-treated PBMC-CM (up to 4-fold – data not shown). Therefore, to explore this possibility we used TNF-α, a known up-regulator of ICAM-1, and re-examined CVA21-direct oncolysis and assessed viral replication following TNF-α treatment. These results demonstrated that both THP-1 and Kasumi-1 cells remained resistant to CVA21-direct oncolysis despite a greater than 10-fold increase in ICAM-1 expression (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S3B and C); moreover, plaque assays confirmed that there was no increase in CVA21 titre, compared to input virus, 72 h post-infection (data not shown). In addition, we also examined viral replication (by plaque assay) in CVA21-resistant THP-1 and Kasumi-1 cells following treatment with PBMC-CM (to increase ICAM- expression); similarly, no increase in viral titre was observed 72 h post infection (data not shown).</p><p id="Par48">By contrast, KG-1 cells became susceptible to CVA21-direct oncolysis in accordance with increased ICAM-1 expression (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S3D and E); suggesting that death of KG-1 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) could, in part, be mediated by increased ICAM-1 expression following treatment with CVA21 treated PBMC-CM, which incorporates a range of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α. Interestingly, complimentary studies carried out using ICAM-1 transduced KG-1 cells (ICAM-1/KG-1), to remove possible off-target effects of TNF-α, examined CVA21 susceptibility in the presence of anti-viral type I IFN-α2 (at levels comparable to those identified in CVA21-treated PBMC-CM); these studies demonstrated a small increase in cytotoxicity following IFN-α treatment alone (as observed in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S3A) but a significant abrogation of CVA21-direct oncolysis (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S3F). Therefore, overall we believe that the inherent resistance of some cell lines to CVA21 (despite high levels of ICAM-1), the abrogation of CVA21-direct oncolysis by type I IFN-α (present in CVA21-treated PBMC-CM), and the direct cytotoxic potential of CVA21-induced cytokines, are more suggestive of bystander cytokine killing and indicate that the inflammatory changes stimulated by CVA21 treatment could contribute to CVA21-induced immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>CVA21-mediated activation of NK cells and potentiation of cellular cytotoxicity</title><p id="Par49">We have previously shown that OV-induced type I IFN-α can increase the anti-tumor properties of NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], therefore given that CVA21 stimulated IFN-α in vitro (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), and activated NK cells in vivo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d), we examined the ability of OV-activated NK cells to eradicate CVA21-sensitive and CVA21-resistant cells.

Interestingly, these data demonstrate that tumor-specific CTLs were produced for both parental-KG-1 and THP-1 cell targets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C), indicating that CVA21-induced oncolysis (particularly for THP-1 cells) was not a pre-requisite for the generation of long-term anti-tumor immunity, as previously observed for reovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>CVA21 maturation of mDC</title><p id="Par53">Given the efficient CTL priming demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, it was postulated that CVA21 would induce DC maturation following co-culture with CVA21-infected cell targets, and thus provide the necessary antigen presentation and co-stimulation to support efficient CTL priming. Surprisingly, upon phenotyping of mDC following treatment with CVA21 alone, or CVA21-loaded targets, limited mDC maturation was observed; CVA21 was unable to directly stimulate mDC maturation and only modest maturation (a small but significant increase in CD86 expression) was observed upon co-culture of mDC with CVA21-treated ICAM-1/KG-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Therefore, the importance for mDC during the course of the CTL priming assay was examined. To investigate this, we compared the ability of CVA21 to prime tumor-specific CTLs in the presence or absence of ex vivo generated, tumor-loaded, mDC. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b shows that CTLs primed with or without mDC were comparable in their capacity to lyse relevant tumor cell targets, demonstrating that CVA21-treated tumor cells can support CTL priming, irrespective of the presence or absence of mDC. Importantly, the CTLs generated in the absence of mDC retained their tumor specificity as CTL degranulation was only observed upon recognition of relevant, but not irrelevant, cell targets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Collectively, these data confirmed that in vitro generated mDC were not required for successful CTL priming, and suggested that all cellular components required for adaptive CTL priming, by CVA21-treated tumor cells, were present in the peripheral blood. This finding is of particular importance in the context of hematological malignances as CVA21-loaded tumor cells may co-exist, in the blood, with immune cell components that are necessary for effective CTL priming.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>mDC are not necessary for priming of AML-specific CTL. <bold>a</bold>. mDC were treated with CVA21 or CVA21-treated ICAM-1/KG-1 cells for 48 h and expression of the activation markers, CD86, CD80 or HLA-DR, was examined (n = 4). <bold>b</bold>.

Therefore, to identify potential biomarkers of CVA21 response we sought to further characterize the molecular and cellular determinants required for CVA21-mediated immune activation. Our preliminary studies suggested that CVA21 was unable to directly activate isolated NK cells (data not shown), therefore, in the context of PBMC, we initially examined the role of anti-viral type I IFN for the induction of CVA21-mediated NK cell anti-tumor immunity. Using monoclonal type I IFN-blocking antibodies, we confirmed that NK cell activation was mediated by type I IFNs, as NK cell CD69 upregulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a) and increased NK cell degranulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b), following CVA21 treatment of PBMC, was not observed when type I IFN signaling was inhibited.

Ex vivo treatment of primary AML blasts with CVA21 identified a number of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 8 of 16) whose blasts were susceptible to CVA21 killing (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S4A), whilst CD45<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic non-malignant cells remained unharmed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S4B). Initially, to explore whether CVA21 efficacy was dependent on direct oncolysis we examined the association between CVA21-induced death and ICAM-1 expression on malignant AML blasts; interestingly, no correlation was observed (Pearson’s r = 0.122, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S4C). Furthermore, no detectable viral replication was observed in nine out of the 10 samples tested, with only low-level viral replication observed in one sample (data not shown). Whilst disappointing in terms of the capacity of CVA21 to directly infect and lyse AML cells, these data were in accordance with our in vitro cell line data (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S2B and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S3C) which suggested that AML cell lines were relatively non-permissive to CVA21-direct oncolysis.</p><p id="Par56">Given the capacity of CVA21 to induce innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), it was therefore postulated that the immunotherapeutic properties of CVA21 could be responsible for death of primary AML blasts. In support of this we have demonstrated that: patient-derived, CVA21-treated PBMC-CM was cytotoxic against AML cell lines (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S4D); IFN-α, which stimulates immune cell activation but abrogates CVA21-direct oncolysis, was induced in CVA21 treated AML patient samples (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S4E); patient NK cells were activated by CVA21 to increase CD69 expression (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S4F); and that NK cell activation correlated with IFN-α production (Pearson’s r = 0.74, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0009; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Figure S4G). Furthermore, ICAM-1 expression on non-malignant CD45<sup>+</sup> immune effector cells within patient samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e) significantly correlated with the efficacy of CVA21 (death of patient AML blasts) in these primary patient samples (Pearson’s r = 0.67, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>f). Therefore, within a mixed cell population, comprising patient AML blasts with autologous non-malignant CD45<sup>+</sup> immune effector cells, the susceptibility of AML cells to CVA21 treatment was determined by ICAM-1 expression on immune effector cells, not the malignant AML compartment. Thus, whilst the exact immune mechanisms responsible for CVA21 cytotoxicity towards AML blasts have not been defined, these data support a role for CVA21-induced immunotherapy for CVA21 efficacy in AML patient samples, and demonstrated the importance of ICAM-1 in mediating this immune response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are essential for induction of CVA21-mediated anti-tumor immunity</title><p id="Par57">As ICAM-1 was identified as a key mediator of CVA21 anti-tumor immunity, we next sought to identify the immune cell component responsible for CVA21 recognition, and downstream immune activation. Initially, we identified both monocytes (CD14<sup>+</sup>) and pDC as cell populations which expressed significantly more ICAM-1 than NK cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A), therefore, we hypothesized that these two cell types may act as key regulators of CVA21-mediated anti-tumor immunity. To test this, we first examined IFN-α production (a key mediator of NK cell activation; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) from PBMC depleted of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, pDC, or both (CD14<sup>+</sup> cells and pDC), along with isolated CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and pDC. Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B demonstrates that pDC, in isolation, secreted large amounts of IFN-α following CVA21 treatment, and that IFN-α secretion from PBMC was abrogated following pDC depletion. By contrast, CD14<sup>+</sup> depletion had no significant effect on IFN-α levels following CVA21 treatment, and isolated CD14<sup>+</sup> cells did not secrete IFN-α in response to CVA21 treatment. To further examine the role of monocytes and pDC for anti-tumor immunity, we repeated PBMC-CM toxicity, NK cell activation and degranulation assays, as well as T cell priming experiments but depleted CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, pDC, or both, from the whole PBMC population. Interestingly, CVA21-treated PBMC-CM remained toxic to kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells in the absence of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells; however, when PBMC were depleted of pDC, the cytotoxicity of CVA21-treated PBMC-CM was reduced to levels comparable with untreated PBMC-CM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C). Moreover, the absence of IFN-α following pDC depletion (but not monocyte depletion), abrogated CVA21-induced NK cell activation with regards to both CD69 up-regulation, and enhanced NK cell degranulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D). Furthermore, CTL priming assays (performed without the addition of autologous mDC) also revealed the importance of pDC, as the absence of CD14<sup>+</sup> did not significantly decrease the production of tumor-specific CTLs; however, removal of pDC significantly reduced levels of tumor-specific CTL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E). Taken together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, the critical role of pDC in orchestrating CVA21-induced innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses and confirm the immunotherapeutic potential of this agent.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>pDC orchestrate innate and adaptive CVA21 anti-tumor immunity. <bold>a</bold>.

The results presented here demonstrate the potential for efficient OVT against both AML and MM, despite AML cells being relatively resistant to CVA21-direct oncolysis. We have demonstrated that CVA21 can potentiate: 1) innate anti-tumor immunity, mediated both by cytokine-induced bystander killing and activation of NK cells; and 2) adaptive anti-tumor immunity against known TAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Mechanistically we have also demonstrated the importance of ICAM-1 on immune cell components, identified pDC as key orchestrators of CVA21-induced immunotherapy, and established that everything required to boost CVA21 immunity is available in the blood, which may be of particular significance in the hematological disease setting. Importantly, a role for CVA21-induced immunotherapy was also revealed for tumor cells which were both sensitive and resistant to CVA21-direct oncolysis, potentially widening the clinical applicability of this agent. Whilst we do not fully understand the mechanism/s by which CVA21 acts to boost CTL responses in less permissive tumor cells, it is possible that viral attachment to cell surface DAF (which is expressed by THP-1 and Kasumi-1; data not shown) or ICAM-1 which is expressed, albeit at low levels, facilitates immune activation and subsequent priming of CTLs. Access to blood samples from cancer patients taking part in the STORM (VLA009A) clinical trial (a Phase I dose escalation study of i.v. CVA21) enabled us to explore immune changes that occur in the blood following intravenous delivery of CVA21. These studies showed that interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) were induced 3 days after the first CVA21 infusion; moreover, at day 3 CD69 expression on NK cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was also increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d-f) but decreased by day 22. Transient expression of CD69 on NK cells, associated with an IFN response, has previously been reported for reovirus, a dsRNA oncolytic virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Currently, the exact function of CD69 on lymphocytes remains unclear although CD69 has been implicated in both cell adhesion/migration and nutrient uptake. For example, CD69 expression can influence the migration and retention of lymphocytes within lymphoid tissue, and facilitate cell-to-cell interactions with APC via Gal-1. Additionally, CD69 contributes to the stability of LAT-1 (required for amino acid transport) on the plasma membrane of lymphocytes to facilitate nutrient uptake to sustain the activation and proliferation lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The transient nature of CD69+ lymphocytes in the blood of patients after CVA21 treatment was not unexpected as CD69 is considered an early marker of lymphocyte activation which can be induced quickly but also declines rapidly following stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Unfortunately, as tumor biopsies were not available during this study it is unclear whether CD69+ lymphocytes persist in CVA21 treated patients, at sites other than the blood (i.e. lymph node and/or tumour), or whether CD69 was downregulated on lymphocytes as a mechanism of immune control once adaptive/humoral immunity had been appropriately triggered.</p><p id="Par59">The dependence on pDC for detection and initiation of an immune response, resulting from abundant secretion of IFN-α, is in contrast to other OVs, namely reovirus, where monocytes were identified as key detectors in the peripheral blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and could ultimately be used to inform patient stratification and predict responsiveness to CVA21 therapy. For example, personalized medicine approaches could be considered targeting patients with normal to high pDC levels, or patients with high expression of ICAM-1 on immune cell subsets and/or malignant blasts. Both of which could be easily assessed by flow cytometry on peripheral blood samples. Interestingly, pDC are increased in the bone marrow of MM patients, and whilst they are believed to contribute to immune cell dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment, engagement of pDC pattern recognition receptors (PRR), namely TLR-9, can restore pDC function and promote T cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] - a concept worth considering in the context of CVA21 engagement of alternative PRRs.</p><p id="Par60">Whilst the direct lytic potential of CVA21 against primary AML was disappointing, the capacity of CVA21 to modulate anti-tumor immunity in the absence of lytic killing remains encouraging for patients with a more competent immune system, such as patients with MRD (minimal residual disease) or early relapse, when disease burden may be low; patients in remission have a reconstituted immune response with functional NK and T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, to maximize OVT, the development of novel combination approaches should be prioritized. For example, combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as valproic acid (VPA), could be evaluated to: 1) increase the expression of NKG2D ligands on malignant blasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and boost the cytotoxic effect of NK cells following OVT, or 2) synergise with OVs to increase viral replication and oncolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In addition, hypomethylating agents, such as decitabine, can increase the expression of TAAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], therefore combination of CVA21 with different epigenetic modulators may be advantageous to boost both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par61">In summary, we have shown that CVA21 can trigger anti-tumor responses against hematological malignancies. Moreover, pDC are central to detection of the virus in the circulation, and to subsequent priming of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. For successful anti-TAA human CTL priming by CVA21-infected tumor cells, PBMCs suffice as a source of APC and responder T cells; therefore, in the context of hematological malignancies treated by systemic OVT, all the cellular components necessary for virus-mediated immunotherapy (including the tumor cells as an antigen source, as well as responder immune cells) are readily accessible. Overall, these data support the testing of intravenous CVA21 for the treatment of AML and MM, particularly in patients with a low disease burden and, potentially, in combination with other immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, the capacity of CVA21 to boost immunotherapeutic responses, despite relative resistance to CVA21-direct oncolysis, broadens the clinical applicability of this agent.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Richard Ingram (University of Leeds) for contributing the HL-60 cell line, Dr. Euan Polson and Dr. Verena Kuchler (University of Leeds) for contributing the ICAM-1 lentivirus vector, and Prof. Graham Cook for providing Taqman probes.
