Humans are also susceptible to these parasites, and domesticated and wild ruminants, particularly livestock, represent important sources of zoonotic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In mammals, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. mainly affect the gut, causing gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhoea. Approximately 90% of human infections are caused by <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium hominis</italic>, although over 20 species can infect humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In immunocompetent patients, cryptosporidiosis is a self-limiting infection of the small intestine that causes watery diarrhoea and can last up to ten days, whereas the infection can become a chronic and life-threatening disease in immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Transmission occurs <italic>via</italic> the faecal-oral route through the ingestion of oocysts contaminating food or water. Oocysts are highly resistant to environmental conditions, chlorination and other sterilisation treatments, and contamination of water plants can therefore cause massive outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It follows that the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation consider protozoa of the genus <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> to be one of the most significant food-borne parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">In livestock husbandry, <italic>C. parvum</italic> is a major cause of severe diarrhoea among neonate calves and lambs, resulting in substantial costs for farmers. A recent study on diarrhoea conducted on calves younger than one month reported that <italic>C. parvum</italic> is responsible, as the sole agent, for 37% of diarrhoeal infections and for 20% of co-infections with other intestinal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">In recent years, infections by <italic>C. parvum</italic> and <italic>C. hominis</italic> have emerged as significant causes of infantile diarrhoea. An extended case-control study, referred to as the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], has shown a high prevalence of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. among children in developing countries, ranking these protozoa among the four pathogens responsible for the majority of diarrhoea cases in children younger than five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The prevalence of these parasites is higher in infants aged less than 11 months and, in this age range, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. is the second most common cause of death associated with diarrhoea, after rotavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">The susceptibility of neonates and children to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. is not completely understood. In the nursing period, the innate immune response of enterocytes, which is usually triggered by the stimulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), is almost completely inhibited so as to favour the establishment of commensal flora in the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Given that the immune response to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. begins with TLR4 stimulation and the consequent activation of the NF-kappa B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the temporary inhibition of the innate enterocyte response could promote the proliferation and dissemination of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. in the neonatal intestine.</p><p id="Par35">At present, nitazoxanide is the only drug approved for cryptosporidiosis by the US Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA), but this drug cannot be used in children younger than one year and is ineffective in immunodeficient patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">A vaccine for cryptosporidiosis is not yet available, and immune protection of neonates is difficult to achieve because of their early-age immune status. However, various <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. proteins, particularly those considered to be virulence factors, have been proposed as possible vaccine candidates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">In this context, the passive immunisation of neonates might be an alternative to a conventional vaccine. Indeed, passive immunity provided through hyperimmune bovine colostrum has been shown to establish an appreciable level of protection in human patients with AIDS-associated cryptosporidiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. More recently, the protective role of maternal anti-<italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> antibodies has been demonstrated in two natural contexts. A survey of a child cohort in Bangladesh reported that the presence of anti-<italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> IgA in breast milk protects neonates from cryptosporidiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A second study, conducted in an endemic area of Tanzania on a cohort of breastfeeding mothers and their infants (0 to 6 months), has shown that the infection rate increases with a reduction in maternal milk ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">This study investigates the feasibility of an immunological preventive treatment to impede or reduce cryptosporidiosis in newborn mammals. As a preliminary step, two recombinant antigens, SA35 and SA40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], were inoculated in adult mice to achieve the onset of a specific immune response. A group of female mice were then immunised by mucosal delivery of the same antigens prior to and during their pregnancies in parallel with a control group treated only with the adjuvant. The offspring of these mice were then infected with two different doses of <italic>C. parvum</italic> oocysts (1 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 5 × 10<sup>3</sup>) and the parasite burden was measured by flow cytometry, microscopic count and a quantitative PCR assay. Our results indicated that neonates born from immunised mothers had a reduced parasitic load compared to the neonates born from the control mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Parasites and reagents</title><p id="Par39"><italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> oocysts (isolate code ISSC6) were collected from faeces of experimentally infected calves and purified by centrifuging with sucrose and Percoll<sup>®</sup> (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) density-gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>-crude extract (CCE) was obtained as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Here, we explored the protective effect of anti-<italic>C. parvum</italic> maternal antibodies transferred to newborns through the placenta during gestation and through the colostrum in the first days of life. To this end, two recombinant peptides (SA35 and SA40) were first immunologically characterised by IP injection in adult mice to evaluate their potential as immunogens. Both peptides, separately and in a mixed formulation, induced specific IgG and IgA responses. SA35 and SA40 peptides have been previously described as immunodominant antigens involved in the maintenance of T-cell response in healthy <italic>C. parvum</italic>-sensitised individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is important to note that the amino acid sequences of SA35 and SA40 peptides do not show similarities with mammalian proteins, but, by contrast, are also highly conserved in other <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> species and particularly in other human pathogens (data not shown). Therefore, it is most likely that antibodies for SA35 and SA40 also react with the strictly related proteins of <italic>C. hominis</italic> and <italic>C. ubiquitum</italic>. In this study, it has been demonstrated that IP immunisation with these recombinant peptides is able to support an effective cell-mediated immunity in response to specific stimuli: CCE-, SA35- and SA40-induced specific proliferation in splenocytes from all immunised adult mice. However, maximum proliferative responses to CCE were obtained in splenocytes from mice following IP immunisation with SA35 or the SA35/40 mix (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The induced cell populations showed a higher percentage of cells expressing CD3+ and CD4+. Moreover, splenocytes from mice immunised with SA35 showed a significant reduction in the percentage of regulatory cells (CD4+/CD25+) compared to the control group, whereas the others did not (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Overall, the three antigen formulations (SA35, SA40 or SA35/40 mix) induced IFN-γ, IL-12 and, to a lesser extent, IL-4 in immunised mice (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). What is noteworthy is that stimulation with the homologous antigen resulted in the highest level of production of these cytokines even when the splenocytes also responded to stimulation with CCE (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Experimental studies and clinical cases have demonstrated that activation of CD4+ lymphocytes and production of IFN-γ are crucial for parasite clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Indeed, IFN-γ production is one of the essential functions of CD4+ cells in response to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. With regard to humoral response, all three antigenic formulations (SA35, SA40 or SA35/40 mix) induced specific IgG, IgG1 and secretory IgA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The production of these transferable antibodies is a fundamental requirement in conferring protective immunity for neonates. Therefore, the antigenic SA35/40 mix was used for mucosal immunisation of female mice in order to evaluate the protective effect on their offspring. The efficacy of this treatment was assessed on the basis of infection of littermates born from females immunised using two different doses of oocysts, 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 5 × 10<sup>3</sup>. The comparison between <italic>C. parvum</italic>-infected littermates born from immunised mothers and their respective controls, i.e. <italic>C. parvum</italic>-infected littermates born from mothers immunised only using a mucosal adjuvant, showed that maternal protection is highly effective with the lower infective dose (5 × 10<sup>3</sup>), since there was a 96% reduction in parasitic burden (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p id="Par66">In adult females, mucosal immunisation with the SA35/40 mix leads to a long-lasting (33 weeks) humoral response at systemic and intestinal level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Moreover, splenocytes from BALB/c mothers specifically proliferated in response to CCE and the resulting population showed an increase in the percentages of CD3+/CD4+ and CD30+ cells (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par67">The experimental infection of neonate mice born from immunised mothers showed that when neonates were infected with a massive dose of oocysts (1 × 10<sup>5</sup>), the protective effect on the progeny is measurable but ineffective (−23% of excreted oocysts). Conversely, a drastic reduction (96%) in oocyst emission was observed when neonates were infected with a lower dose (5 × 10<sup>3</sup> oocysts), which still represents a huge amount given the small weight (about 1 g) of newborn mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>); in fact, this dose is comparable to a dose of 30 × 10<sup>7</sup> oocysts in a 60 kg human. These oocyst numbers were tested in the first instance to allow a quantitative analysis of excreted oocysts and of all parasitic forms using flow cytometry, although the 5 × 10<sup>3</sup> dose yielded parasite amounts below the sensitivity threshold for the instrument. To overcome this technical limitation, IFA/microscopic counting and qPCR were used to evaluate the minimal quantity of parasites in infected mice. Moreover, DNA samples for qPCR were prepared using an <italic>ad-hoc</italic> automated method in order to reduce handling errors.</p><p id="Par68">Cell-mediated immunity showed unexpected signs of activity in splenocytes harvested from litters from immunised mothers, as there was an increase in the percentage of CD3+-CD4+ cells as well as CD30+ cells (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Similarly, T-cell responses were identified after maternal vaccination in newborn mice of a <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> model, although there was no parallel increase in antibody response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Recent studies indicate that during pregnancy, maternal molecules such as inflammatory cytokines, as well as microbial products, are transferred <italic>in utero</italic> to the foetus and this influences the foetal immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Thus, neonatal hosts may compensate for an insufficiency in adaptive immune responses by having a heightened capacity to mount certain types of innate immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">Attempts at passive immunisation through administration of hyperimmune colostrum have been performed in humans and in other mammals. Indeed, hyperimmune bovine colostrum was given to AIDS patients with prolonged cryptosporidiosis, resulting in a reduction in diarrhoea and an improvement in symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In livestock, passive immunisation with recombinant antigens has shown a certain efficacy in protecting passively immunised calves and kids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. More recently, heterologous protection was also successfully tested through administration of hyperimmune ovine colostrum in neonate mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Unlike previous studies, this study combined the use of a mixture of two defined antigens extensively characterised as immunogens. A further peculiarity of this study is the mucosal immunisation of females to confer protection for their progeny.</p><p id="Par70">Maternal immunisation protocols for other pathogens have been applied successfully to prevent neonatal infectious diseases in various contexts. With regard to livestock, a vaccine for rotavirus, coronavirus and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Rotavec-Corona<sup>®</sup>, MSD) is commonly used to immunise heifers and preparturient cows. This treatment induces a higher titre of specific antibodies for these pathogens in colostrum and milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and has significant efficacy in reducing diarrhoea in neonate calves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In humans, maternal immunisation with tetanus toxoid has been the first example of effective prevention for neonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and it has been extensively applied as part of the WHO Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (MNTE) program. Successful immunisations have been also achieved with influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and with the acellular pertussis antigen vaccine that protects infants from clinical pertussis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Therefore, maternal immunisation can be an effective strategy to limit neonatal cryptosporidiosis before the development of a mature immune system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par71">The SA35 and SA40 peptides enhance humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to <italic>C. parvum</italic> in adult mice.
