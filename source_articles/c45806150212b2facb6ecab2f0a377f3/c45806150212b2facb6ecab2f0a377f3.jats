Henn. and its major active substance hypocrellin exert unique curative effects on skin diseases, diabetes, and cancers. The wild <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> is endangered due to its harsh breeding conditions and long growth cycle. It is one of the effective ways to utilize the resources sustainably to produce hypocrellin by fermentation of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>. PB90 is a protein elicitor isolated from <italic>Phytophthora boehmeriae</italic> to induce the useful metabolites production in fungi. In this work, PB90 was selected to promote the synthesis hypocrellin by <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>. To evaluate the effect of PB90 on <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, it was found that the induced cells showed decreased biomass, increased cell wall permeability, rapid induction of secondary metabolites, and significant increase of some enzyme activities, which confirmed a strong activation of phenylalanine/flavonoid pathways. Studies on signal molecules and gene expression level in <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> treated with PB90 have found that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO) are necessary signal molecules involved in the synthesis of hypocrellin in elicited cells, and increased their signal levels through mutual reaction. We have showed for the first time, the response mechanism of hypocrellin biosynthesis from <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> to PB90, which may be not only establish a theoretical foundation for the application of PB90 to the mass production of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, but can also motivate further research on the application of PB90 to the conservation and sustainable utilization of other medical fungi.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hypocrellin</kwd><kwd><italic>Shiraia bambusicola</italic></kwd><kwd>PB90</kwd><kwd>Nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>Hydrogen peroxide</kwd><kwd>Permeability</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">ZR2016CL01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>28</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13568_2019_Article_867.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Microbiology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Microbial Genetics and Genomics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par18"><italic>Shiraia bambusicola</italic> P. Henn. is a fungus that grows on bamboo branches and is mainly distributed in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces in China, as well as in Japan and Sri Lanka (Zhao and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> is a kind of precious medicinal fungus with mild nature and taste. This rare traditional Chinese medicine can promote blood circulation, remove blood stasis, dredge channels and collaterals, eliminate phlegm, relieve cough, and invigorate spleen to replenish qi (Zhao and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>; Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>). Hypocrellin, the main active ingredient of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, is a photosensitive-pigment perylenequinone with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>), photosensitive tumor-cell-killing ability (Jia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>), anti-microvascular disease, and antidiabetes properties (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>). Research on the nature and utilization of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> relies mainly on field collection. The yield and quality are greatly influenced by climate, distribution, and harvest season. The direct use of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> fermentation to produce hypocrellin is an ideal way to solve the growing shortage of crude natural-drug resources. Hypocrellin biosynthesis has the advantages of low investment, low equipment requirements, simple and safe operation, and mild reaction conditions. Most artificial cultures of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> use synthetic medium and are cultured at 28Â Â°C in liquid or solid medium. Most scholars have focused on the production of hypocrellin (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Lei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>; Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>) and anthraquinone compounds (Cai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>) by <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, separating active substances and optimizing the culture medium composition and culture conditions. In addition to the common optimization process, hypocrellin synthesis from <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> has been found to be promoted by the elicitor <italic>Trametes</italic> sp. (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>), surfactant Triton X-100 (Lei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>), ultrasonic wave (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>), and light (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>). Through these steps, hypocrellin yield has been found to increase several times to tens of times. Indeed, different components of the medium and environmental conditions greatly influence hypocrellin synthesis from <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>. Nevertheless, many problems in hypocrellin biosynthesis are still encountered, for example, optimize contents are repeated (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Lei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>; Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>), the hypocrellin synthesis mechanism is unknown (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>), the status of strains used is unclear, and the active metabolite content is low (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>). This series of problems hinders the commercial production of hypocrellin and can be solved by exploring ways to improve hypocrellin yield.</p><p id="Par19">Most secondary metabolites are not directly involved in the growth and development of fungus. Thus, secondary metabolite synthesis is strictly controlled in fungus growing under normal conditions (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). In cell culture, the synthesis of many secondary metabolites is part of the cellular defense response to pathogen attack (Ishihara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>). Therefore, the use of fungal elicitors is one of the most effective strategies for increasing the productivity of useful secondary metabolites in cell culture (Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2015</xref>). Specific fungal elicitors can increase the accumulation of secondary metabolites in plant cells and have thus been successfully applied in plant-cell-suspension cultures with potential for commercialization (Simic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Indeed, the use of elicitors to promote the rapid and large-scale synthesis of useful secondary products by fungal cells has become a new important method (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). PB90 is a protein elicitor (molecular weightâ=â90Â kDa) isolated from <italic>Phytophthora boehmeriae</italic> (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2003</xref>). The infiltration of PB90 into tobacco leaves reportedly induced hypersensitive responses and systemic acquired resistance (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>). In tobacco and Chinese cabbage, PB90 treatment strongly enhanced the pathogen-related accumulation of PR-1 and the expression of chitinase (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). Treatment of PB90 stimulated hypericin production and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) generation in <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> cells and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was essential for PB90-induced hypericin production (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). These results suggested that PB90 may induce plant defense responses and accumulation of secondary metabolites, and so on. However, few researchers have studied the effect of PB90 on fungal metabolites, and no one has studied the effect of PB90 on the secondary metabolites of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>. The accumulation of many secondary metabolites is widely believed to be a defense mechanism of cellular against pathogenic attacks (Zhai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016</xref>). Thus, obtaining useful elicitors from microorganisms can effectively improve the productivity of useful secondary metabolites in cell cultures. To examine the effect of PB90 on the secondary metabolites of cultured fungal cells, we measured hypocrellin yield in <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> after PB90 treatment. Results showed that PB90 was an effective elicitor of increasing hypocrellin yield in <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>. The effects on <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> biomass, cell wall,metabolites, signal molecules, and related genes were also examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Strains, chemicals and culture medium</title><p id="Par20"><italic>Shiraia bambusicola</italic> BZ-16X1 was collected and identified by the Institute of Fungal Resources, Binzhou University, China.

In addition to antidiabetic properties, hypocrellin can induce apoptosis and radiosensitize tumor cells. It has anti-inflammatory and phototherapy effects on skin diseases (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>; Jia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>). Fungal cell culture produces active metabolites with various complex structures due to the enormous commercial value of active metabolites, limited supply, or endangered status of parental species, and this has been the focus of researchers (Knapp and KovÃ¡cs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>; Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2016</xref>). Cell culture of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> provides an alternative for hypocrellin production. Most secondary metabolites are not directly involved in the growth and development of fungus. Thus, secondary metabolite synthesis is strictly controlled in fungus growing under normal conditions (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). In cell culture, the synthesis of many secondary metabolites is part of the cellular defense response to pathogen attack (Ishihara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>). Therefore, the use of fungal elicitors is one of the most effective strategies for increasing the productivity of useful secondary metabolites in cell culture (Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2015</xref>). Inducers prepared in pathogens can be used to improve secondary metabolites of cells. PB90 is a novel protein inducer secreted by <italic>P. boehmeriae</italic>. PB90 treatment reportedly triggered a highly sensitive reaction in tobacco plants (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). In addition to hypersensitivity reactions, secondary metabolite accumulation is another common response of cells to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. However, few researchers have studied the effect of PB90 on fungal metabolites, and no one has studied the effect of PB90 on the secondary metabolites of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>. Results of our study showed that the production of hypocrellin was significantly increased in <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> cells treated with PB90. Production reached approximately 2.5-fold within 24Â h after treatment, thereby indicating that PB90 can induce the production of hypocrellin in <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> cells. Therefore, it is suggested that PB90 might be a new potential inducer that can improve secondary metabolite production of fungal cells.</p><p id="Par38">The induction effect of the elicitor on cell growth depends on the type, concentration, and cell growth stage of the elicitor at the time of challenge application (Simic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Polysaccharide extracts of the exogenous fungal mycelium negatively affect the biomass of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> cell culture. In the mixed culture of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> and bamboo endophytic fungus <italic>Phoma</italic> sp. BZJ6, the same results were also found (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>). However, the crude polysaccharide elicitor of endophytic fungus <italic>Trametes</italic> sp. TT1 can stimulate the production of the biomass of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> cells (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). Some bacterial crude polysaccharide elicitors did not show any stimulating effect on cell growth after treatment (Du <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>). These findings suggest that the response of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> cells to specific elicitors may vary depending on the cell line and culture conditions. Inhibition of cell growth and survival after induction is caused by a metabolic flux shunt, i.e., the activation of secondary metabolism suppresses the primary metabolic activity (Sivakumar and Paek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>). Indeed, the induction of cell growth and the production of secondary metabolites are often negatively correlated, and the elicitor PB90 can be used as an effective elicitor for obtaining valuable bioactive compounds from <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> cells. Observation of elicitor PB90 role of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, found that the action of PB90 causes cell morphological changes, can increase the permeability of the cell wall, reduce the stability of vesicles in the cell wall, thus increasing the accumulation of hypocrellin. The result is similar to some studies, for example, Triton X-100 treatment of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> enhanced hypocrellin production was mainly due to both elicited biosynthesis in mycelium and the increased membrane permeability for hypocrellin release (Lei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>). After the tobacco was treated with PB90, DAPI staining observed the morphological characteristics of chromatin agglutination and nuclear disintegration in the cells (Ji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR01">2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">PB90 caused a large accumulation of total phenolics and flavonoids in the cells induced by <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>. When treated with fungal elicitors <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, <italic>Phoma exigua</italic> and <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, the production of naphtodianthrones and phenylpropanoids in the cell suspension of <italic>H. perforatum</italic> were also stimulated (Simic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). The accumulation of total phenolics and flavonoids by <italic>H. perforatum</italic> under the induction of the fungus <italic>Nomuraea rileyi</italic> shows that these active compounds are the inducing part of the cellular defense response (Meirelles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). Therefore, the increase in phenylpropanoid production may be due to the activation of plant cell defense pathways. Extracellular products are released from the cells. As observed in this study, the specific effects of fungal inducers are most likely related to fungal interactions and the complexity of inducing signal transduction, thereby leading to cellular defense responses (Garrido-Gala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). The current study indicates that PB90 can induce the enzyme activity of PAL and CHI. Such rapid PAL activation may be related to the fact that PB90 is a protein from <italic>P. boehmeriae</italic>, which can trigger early plant defense response (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>). The research results support the increase in PAL activity in different cell cultures induced by fungus (Ganapathy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>). Even if PAL is a key regulatory enzyme that leads to the formation of a wide range of phenylpropanoid metabolites (Sabela et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>), CHI is necessary for the biosynthesis of flavonoids (Ververidis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>). The increase in flavonoid accumulation in cucumber plants under the induction of the fungal pathogen <italic>Sphaeroteca fuliginea</italic> indicates the significance of these phenolic compounds in plant defense systems (Fofana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>). In our previous study on mixed cultures of <italic>Phoma</italic> sp. BZJ6 and <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, synergistic induction of PAL and CHI was associated with the significantly higher laccase activity in cells after fungal mixed culture (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>). The most effective way to use the data is to apply it to liquid culture in the process of making better use of the cells, or to insert the elicitors into the cells cultured in solid medium to resolve the difficulties that may be encountered. Therefore, promoting the infiltration of fungal elicitors in suspension cells can effectively trigger the enzyme activity of PAL and CHI. If such a consequence exists in cells treated with PB90, then changes in phenol levels may be a response to changes in the enzyme.</p><p id="Par40">Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is one of the most common metabolic activities caused by pathogenic infection in cells or cultured cell treatment with different elicitors. The strong and rapid stimulating effect of fungal elicitors on plant secondary metabolite accumulation has been extensively investigated (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>; Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). A simultaneous increase in the production of phenylpropanoid and hypocrellin and the enzyme activity of PAL and CHI indicates that PB90 is an effective strategy to enhance different phenolic compounds. However, the signal transduction mechanism of fungal elicitors that mediate the synthesis of fungal secondary metabolites is poorly understood. NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are two common signaling molecules in cells. Results revealed that NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were the signaling molecules necessary for PB90-induced synthesis of hypocrellin. The hypocrellin production of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> treated with the combination of NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was obviously higher than that under the single NO treatment, suggesting that NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could elicit synergistic effects through signal cooperation in hypocrellin-mediated synthesis. Previous research showed that <italic>PKS</italic> can be used to catalyze the early step of the condensation reaction of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA subunits (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>). The claisen-type cyclization of hypocrellin aromatic ring can be possibly catalyzed by PKS-type thioesterase, the expression level of <italic>PKS</italic> was significantly increased under PB90 in our current study. The expression levels of <italic>FAD</italic> gene greatly increased with the interaction of PB90 possibly because fungal cells produced more active oxygen when they interacted with the elicitors. As a result, these cells evolved into their higher antioxidant state (NowogÃ³rska and Patykowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>). Therefore, the normal redox state of cells should be maintained (de Simone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). Oxidoreductase can reduce aldehydes or ketones to form various alcohols or amine compounds. The superfamily of <italic>MFS</italic> transporters are composed of many members and widely found in lower and higher organisms. Nearly a quarter of the transporters encoded in the microbial genome belong to this superfamily (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2017</xref>). In the PB90 treatment of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, <italic>MFS</italic> gene expression also increased possibly because <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> cells were the first to produce a defense response, the <italic>MFS</italic> transporters was activated and involved in this process, possibly transporting the secondary metabolites to prevent PB90 invasion. The expression levels of <italic>PKS</italic>, <italic>FAD</italic>, and <italic>MFS</italic> genes significantly decreased when NO inhibitor and CAT were added compared with their corresponding levels when PB90 was added. When only NO inhibitor or CAT was added, the expression levels of <italic>PKS</italic>, <italic>FAD</italic>, and <italic>MFS</italic> genes slightly decreased. These results further confirmed that NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were involved in the regulation of hypocrellin produced by <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> and activated by PB90, revealing a special interaction between NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in mediating PB90-stimulated hypocrellin synthesis. NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling pathways can be involved in the signal transduction of flavonoid synthesis in cells by UV light, these pathways can also participate in the signal transduction of hypericin synthesis in <italic>H. perforatum</italic> through thermal shock (Simic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>; Lazzara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017</xref>). However, hypocrellin biosynthesis induced by <italic>Aspergillum niger</italic> crude polysaccharide extract can be inhibited by cPITO (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>), and hypericin synthesis in hypericum cells induced by PB90 can be blocked by CAT, which is mainly affected by NADPH oxidation-mediated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). Walker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002</xref>) showed that jasmonic acid (JA) increases hypericin production in the cell culture of <italic>H. perforatum</italic>, whereas SA and fungal elicitors <italic>Phytophthora cinnamoni</italic> do not cause any stimulating effects. These results suggested that the response of an induced cell might vary in different cell lines and under various culture conditions. For NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a detailed signal transduction pathway mediated by PB90-induced secondary metabolite synthesis should be further studied.</p><p id="Par41">The cellular defense response is mediated by complex signaling networks (Tani and Funato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>). Our results showed that PB90 was a good method to increase the yield of hypocrellin in a very short period culture of <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, the research group studied the reason of improving the synthesis of hypocrellin. After joining PB90 induction culture, a large number of the main active substance hypocrellin synthesis from <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, biomass decreased, stability of vesicles were reduced, phenols and flavonoids were synthesized, the activities of PAL and CHI in the phenylpropanoid/flavonoid pathway were improved. This indicated that PB90 not only activated the massive synthesis of hypocrellin, but also changed the accumulation of phenols compounds with high antioxidant activity. Pb90 activated the phenylalanine/flavonoid pathway to stimulate the synthesis of hypocrellin. The study also found that PB90 treatment could not only directly induce the synthesis and accumulation of NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> cells, but also that NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the cells under PB90 treatment could improve their signal levels through interaction. Synthesis of hypocrellin was related to genes of <italic>PKS</italic>, <italic>FAD</italic> and <italic>MFS</italic>, and it was further confirmed at the molecular level that NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediated the special signal interaction of hypocrellin induced by PB90. To investigate the relationship between hypocrellin, total phenols, total flavonoids, some enzymes, signaling molecules and gene expression of cells induced by PB90, in order to elucidation the regulatory mechanism of PB90 on the hypocrellin synthesis by <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>. This indicated that the secondary metabolites produced by <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> in liquid culture could be treated with PB90, which could be used as a production route for rapidly increasing the main pharmacological activity of hypocrellin. PB90 treatment shows a promising approach for studying the biosynthetic pathways of fungal secondary metabolites. Therefore, we suggest that this study also play an exemplary role in the study of the application of PB90 in the protection and sustainable utilization of other medicinal fungi resources.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the laboratory staff member of key laboratory of eco-environmental science for Yellow River, school of biological and environmental engineering, Binzhou University.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authorsâ contributions</title><p>WD and CS designed the research; WD, BW, YW and BD performed the research and wrote the paper.
