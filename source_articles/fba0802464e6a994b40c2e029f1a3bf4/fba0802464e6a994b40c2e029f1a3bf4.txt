Background Depression is a widespread chronic medical illness that can affect thoughts, mood, and physical health [ 1 ]. Previous studies have found that depression is closely related to stress; however, to date, the mechanism by which stress induces behavioral disorders is still unclear. Many central neurology and clinical symptoms have confirmed that the cerebral cortex is an important physiological system of emotional activity, and its dysfunction may be the main cause of stress [ 2 ]. In the past, glial cells were only considered complementary partners for neurons. Astrocytes (ASTs) are the largest and most abundant glial cells [ 3 ], accounting for approximately 20% of all glial cells. In recent years, people have developed a new understanding of the function of glial cells. An increasing number of studies have shown that changes in AST function may be involved in the occurrence of a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases [ 4 ]. Depression or long-term psychological stress can cause changes in the morphology, function and plasticity of ASTs, suggesting that the change in AST function may be one of the mechanisms related to stress pathogenesis [ 5 , 6 ]. The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is released into the synaptic cleft by glutamatergic neurons and then taken up by the AST glutamate transporter. AST uptake of glutamate involves both Na + -dependent and non-Na + -dependent systems, where the Na + -dependent system occupies a dominant position in the glutamate transport process of the central nervous system by virtue of its high affinity for glutamate. The Na + -dependent glutamate transporters of ASTs were first isolated from rat brain tissue and named GLT1 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2, EAAT2) and GLAST (EAAT1), which are responsible for the high uptake of glutamate [ 7 ]. Long-term stress can cause AST damage and EAAT dysfunction, and thus, the stress-induced glutamate level in the synaptic cleft cannot be reduced, leading to the induction of excitatory amino acid toxicity and damage to neuronal plasticity. Xiaoyaosan (XYS), a Chinese materia medica, has long been used for treating the syndrome of liver qi stagnation and spleen deficiency, a syndrome closely related to mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression, in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) [ 8 ]. The book of Taiping Huimin Heji Jufang in the Song Dynasty noted that XYS comprises the following eight Chinese herbs: Radix Bupleuri (root of $i$Bupleurum chinense$/i$ DC.), Radix Paeoniae Alba (root of $i$Paeonia lactiflora$/i$ Pall.), Radix Angelicae Sinensis (root of $i$Angelica sinensis$/i$ (Oliv.) Diels), Rhizoma Atractylodis (root and rhizome of $i$Atractylodes lancea$/i$ (Thunb.) DC.), Poria (fungus nucleus of $i$Poria cocos$/i$ (Schw.) Wolf), Radix Glycyrrhizae (root and rhizome of $i$Glycyrrhiza uralensis$/i$ Fisch.), Herba Menthae (aboveground portions of $i$Mentha haplocalyx$/i$ Briq.), and Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens (fresh root and rhizome of $i$Zingiber officinale$/i$ Rosc.). Although there has been much research on the antidepressant mechanism of XYS, few studies have demonstrated an association between the antidepressant effects of XYS and AST and EAAT functions. Furthermore, many studies have shown that cerebral cortical glial cell density is significantly reduced in patients with depression, accompanied by a decrease in AST markers, and GFAP expression in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex (PFC) was observed to be significantly downregulated in a depression model, while many ASTs were atrophied. Additionally, our previous research showed that XYS may have therapeutic effects on depression-like behaviors induced by CUMS in mice, possibly mediated by modulation of the glutamate/glutamine cycle and the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the hippocampus [ 9 ]. Thus, measuring the astrocytic excitatory amino acid transporters in depressive rodents can potentially aid our understanding of the roles that AST and EAAT function in PFC play in depression, as well as explain the antidepressant effects of XYS. In this study, we investigated the alterations of AST and EAAT functions in CUMS mice. Specifically, behavioral tests such as FST, OFT, and NSF were evaluated in CUMS mice. The protein and mRNA levels, along with the immunoreactivity, of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN in the PFC of CUMS mice were measured, as these indicators are considered to reflect the functions of ASTs, EAATs, and neurons. In addition, the glutamate concentration and pathological changes were measured. Materials and methods Animals Eighty specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 J male mice (No. 11400700088123) aged 10 weeks were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., and raised in an SPF animal room with a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C and humidity of 30–40%. After one week of adaptive feeding, the mice were divided into a control group (no stress+normal saline (NS)), a CUMS group (21 days CUMS+NS), an XYS group (21 days CUMS+XYS) and a Flu group (21 days CUMS+Flu) with 20 mice in each group. Five mice in the control group were housed in one cage, and mice in the other three groups were caged alone. All animal experiments were approved by the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Drugs The traditional compound prescription XYS (from Taiping Huimin Heji Jufang) was applied in this experiment; which was composed of the following 8 medicinal herbs: Radix Bupleuri (root of $i$Bupleurum chinense$/i$ DC.), Radix Paeoniae Alba (root of $i$Paeonia lactiflora$/i$ Pall.), Radix Angelicae Sinensis (root of $i$Angelica sinensis$/i$ (Oliv.) Diels), Rhizoma Atractylodis (root and rhizome of $i$Atractylodes lancea$/i$ (Thunb.) DC.), Poria (fungus nucleus of $i$Poria cocos$/i$ (Schw.) Wolf), Radix Glycyrrhizae (root and rhizome of $i$Glycyrrhiza uralensis$/i$ Fisch.), Herba Menthae (aboveground portions of $i$Mentha haplocalyx$/i$ Briq.), and Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens (fresh root and rhizome of $i$Zingiber officinale$/i$ Rosc.), in a ratio of 6:6:6:6:6:3:2:2. These medicinal herbs were purchased from the Medicinal Materials Company of Beijing Tongrentang (Bozhou, Anhui, China) and extracted in the Chinese medicine preparation room of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital as described previously. The extraction rate was 18.8%, and the quality of XYS used in this study was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS) [ 10 ]. Flu (#2061A, Patheon France). Mice in the control and CUMS groups received gavage administration of 0.5 mL of NS for 21 days. Mice in the XYS and Flu treatment groups were administered dosages of 0.25 g/kg/d and 2.6 mg/kg/d, respectively, by gavage. The dosages of XYS and Flu were calculated according to the human and mouse dose conversion formula: dose of mouse = X mg/kg × 70 kg × 0.0026 ÷ 0.02 kg = 9.1X mg/kg (X represents the daily dose of adults/60 kg). The concentration and volume of the gavage administration were adjusted once a week according to the changes in the body weights of the mice. Establishment of the CUMS animal model According to the literature [ 11 , 12 ], 8 kinds of stimuli (a. food deprivation for 24 h; b. water deprivation for 24 h; c. restraint stress for 3 h; d. cold swimming at 10 °C for 5 min; e. heat stress for 20 min; f. electric stress for 20 min; g. wet and soiled cage for 24 h; h. crowded cage for 24 h) were assigned for 21 days according to the random number table method. The mice received only one random stress per day and could not predict the type and timing of the next stress. Open field test (OFT) The experiment was carried out in a quiet, closed, shaded, noninterfering environment using a homemade wooden field box with dimensions of 80 cm × 80 cm × 40 cm; the inner wall and bottom were gray, and the bottom surface was divided into 25 small squares. A camera was placed directly above the market box, and its field of view covered the entire interior of the wooden field box. The mice were placed in the center of the bottom of the open field box and simultaneously photographed and timed to observe the activity of the mice within 5 min. Between the two experiments, the inner and bottom surfaces of the open field box were cleaned. The behavior of each group of mice was analyzed and evaluated using the EthoVision 3.0 behavioral analysis system. This experiment was conducted on the 21st day of modeling. Sucrose preference test (SPT) Mice were trained to adapt to sugary drinking water before the experiment according to a reported procedure [ 13 , 14 ]. At the beginning of the experiment, each mouse was given two bottles of water in advance: one bottle of 1% sucrose water and one bottle of purified water. After 1 h, two bottles were taken and weighed to calculate the consumption of sugar and pure water in animals (Sucrose preference = Sucrose water consumption/total water consumption × 100%). SPT was carried out on the 7th, 14th and 21st days of modeling. Forced swimming test (FST) The experiment was carried out in two days. On the first day, the mice were placed in a forced swimming bucket filled with water (height 20 cm; temperature 22 ± 1 °C) and allowed to swim for 15 min. The next day, mice were placed in the forced swimming bucket for 6 min, and immobility time was measured for 6 min using a video. The duration of immobility for each mouse was recorded during the final 5 min by experimenters who were blinded to the design. This experiment was conducted on the 21st day of modeling. Tissue sample collection After modeling for 21 days, 60 mice were sacrificed by decapitation under anesthesia with 3% sodium pentobarbital by intraperitoneal injection. The whole brains of the remaining 20 mice (5 mice randomly selected from each group) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde via arterial perfusion under deep anesthesia, and ten stored in 4% paraformaldehyde solution at 4 °C for tissue slicing. The PFC tissues of 5 mice in each group were collected in frozen pipes and stored at − 80 °C for Western blotting. The PFC tissues of another 5 mice in each group were collected in frozen pipes with RNA preservation solution for qRT-PCR. The PFC tissues of the remaining mice were collected in frozen pipes for ELISA testing. Histochemical examination The brains of the mice were removed while the mice were under deep anesthesia with pentobarbitone; then, the brains were rinsed with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The specimens were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-μm-thick sections. Some sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), and the other sections were subjected to Nissl staining according to the experimental procedures in the book $i$Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques$/i$ [ 15 ]. Finally, the CellSens Dimension 1.11 image acquisition system was used for observation and photography, and the images were analyzed using the Count &amp; Measure Full cellSens 1.11 system. Immunohistochemical staining analysis Another four sets of 5-μm-thick paraffin sections were processed for immunohistochemical examination. Immunohistochemistry staining was carried out according to previously reported studies [ 16 ]. After deparaffinization and rehydration, antigen retrieval was performed by heating in 0.01 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH = 7.2) for 10 min. Then, the sections were incubated in 3% H 2 O 2 for 10 min and washed in PBST (0.01 M PBS with 0.1% Tween-20). Next, the specific tissue signals were blocked with goat serum working solution overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the sections were incubated in appropriately diluted antibodies (GFAP, Abcam, #ab7260, 1:1000 dilution; EAAT1, Cell Signaling, #5684, 1:500 dilution; EAAT2, Cell Signaling, #3838, 1:500 dilution; NeuN, Abcam, #ab177487, 1:500 dilution). After incubation with the secondary antibody, sections were placed in DAB reagent (ZSBIO, #ZLI-9017) for 5–10 min at room temperature. Finally, the slices were sealed with neutral gum after counterstaining. The images were observed and analyzed using the Court &amp; Measure Full cellSens 1.11 system. Western blot analysis Protein levels of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT1, and NeuN were measured by Western blotting. The protocols were performed as previously described [ 17 , 18 ]. Briefly, proteins were extracted from PFC tissue using a tissue protein extraction kit (CWBIO, #CW0891), and total protein concentrations were measured by using a BCA protein concentration determination kit (Thermo, #23227). Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, #IPVH00010). After blocking with 5% skim milk solution for 2 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight (GFAP, Abcam, #ab7260, 1:500 dilution; EAAT1, Cell Signaling, #5684, 1:1000 dilution; EAAT2, Cell Signaling, #3838, 1:1000 dilution; NeuN, Abcam, #ab177487, 1:500 dilution). After washing with TBST three times for 5 min each time, membranes were incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The protein bands were obtained using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), and the optical density of the protein bands was measured using GIS1D 4.2 image analysis software (#Tanon-5200, Tanon). The intensity of the protein bands was normalized to β-actin. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis Total RNA in the PFC of each mouse was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, #No. 1596–026) at a low temperature on a clean bench. The RNA from each sample was used to synthesize cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with the Gene Amp PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The sequences for primers are shown in Table  1 . The total RNA concentration was determined using an ultra-micro spectrophotometer (Thermo, Nanodrop 2000), and the quality of total RNA was determined by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. qRT-PCR was performed on an ABI ViiA7 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA) with SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix in a final volume of 20 μl with the following thermal cycling conditions: 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 59 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 40 s. A negative control and a GAPDH positive control without template were included for each amplification, the above real-time fluorescence quantification was repeated three times to obtain three Ct values, and the average Ct value was calculated. The data module was derived by an SDS software system, and the expression of GFAP mRNA was quantitatively analyzed according to the RQ = 2 -△△Ct method.

The standard and samples were added to a 96-well plate as required. The optical density value at time 0 (OD 0) was measured at a wavelength of 565 nm at the microplate reader. After standing at room temperature for 30 min, the OD value at time 30 (OD 30) was measured at a wavelength of 565 nm. A standard curve and a fitting equation were drawn according to the ΔΔOD value and concentration of the standard, and the glutamic acid sample concentration (mM) of each well was calculated according to the equation and then multiplied by the dilution factor to obtain the actual glutamic acid concentration. Statistical analysis All data were statistically analyzed using SPSS20.0 software. The repeated measurements data were statistically analyzed using an analysis of variance of repeated measures. For nonrepetitive measurement data, first, a normal distribution test of the data and a homogeneity test between the groups were performed. Data with normal distribution and homogeneity of variance were statistically processed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the comparison between groups was performed using the Holm-Sidak t-test, and the data were expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). If the data did not obey the normal distribution or the variance was different, the Kruskal-Wallis H test was used for statistical analysis, the comparison between groups was performed with the Nemenyi method, and the data were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges. All statistical results were statistically significant at $i$P$/i$ &lt; 0.05. Results Effects of XYS on depression-like behaviors of CUMS-induced mice A series of behavioral tests were conducted to examine the effects of XYS on depression-like behaviors, including the OFT, FST, and SPT. For the OFT test, as shown in Fig.  1 b, the central region residence time of mice in the control and CUMS groups showed no significant difference ($i$P$/i$ = 0.134). The XYS and Flu groups showed a shorter residence time in the central area than that in the CUMS group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.038, $i$P$/i$ = 0.002), but the significant differences were not valid. As shown in Fig. 1 c, the entry times in the central area of mice in the CUMS group were significantly lower than those of the control group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.01), and the differences between the CUMS group and the XYS and Flu-treated groups were not significant (CUMS group versus XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 1.000; CUMS group versus Flu group, $i$P$/i$ = 1.000). As shown in Fig. 1 d, the total distance travelled of mice in the CUMS group was significantly shorter than that of the control group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.00), and compared with the CUMS group, the total distance travelled of mice in the XYS and Flu groups was significantly longer ($i$P$/i$ = 0.07, $i$P$/i$ = 0.029).

Compared with the CUMS group, the sucrose consumption of mice in the XYS and Flu-treated groups increased significantly on day 7 ($i$P$/i$ = 0.00, $i$P$/i$ = 0.00), and day 21 ($i$P$/i$ = 0.00, $i$P$/i$ = 0.00). With the extension of the model establishment time, the total sucrose consumption of all mice in the CUMS group decreased, and the reduction on the 21st day was the most significant.

However, compared with the CUMS group, the cell morphology of the PFC PrL region of mice in the XYS and Flu groups was improved significantly, and the difference between the control group and both treated groups was not obvious.

The micrographs in the first row were captured using a low-magnification microscope (scale bar = 100 μm, 100× magnification); the remaining micrographs were captured using a higher-magnification microscope (scale bar = 20 μm, 400× magnification). c. Quantitative analysis of the neuron numbers of Nissl-stained neurons in the PFC PrL region. The Nemenyi method is used for data comparative analysis between groups.

Compared with the CUMS group, the neurons of mice in the XYS- and Flu-treated groups showed clear improvements in shape and number. As shown in Fig. 4 c, the number of neurons in the PFC of mice in the CUMS group was significantly lower than that of the control group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.00) and increased significantly in the PFC of mice in the XYS and Flu groups compared with that in the CUMS group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.011, $i$P$/i$ = 0.00). Effects of XYS on GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN immunolabeling As shown in Fig.  5 b, the OD value of GFAP and NeuN proteins in the PFC of mice in the CUMS group was observably lower than that of the control group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.00, $i$P$/i$ = 0.043), whereas that in the XYS and Flu groups was increased significantly relative to the CUMS group (GFAP: $i$P$/i$ = 0.00 versus the XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.007 Flu group; NeuN: $i$P$/i$ = 0.00 versus the XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.003 versus the Flu group), and the differences between the control group and treatment groups were not significant (GFAP: $i$P$/i$ = 1.00 versus the XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 1.00 versus the Flu group; NeuN: $i$P$/i$ = 1.00 versus the XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 1.00 versus the Flu group). The MOD of the EAAT1 and EAAT2 proteins in the PFC of mice in the CUMS group was markedly lower than that of the control group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.044, $i$P$/i$ = 0.002), and the EAAT1 and EAAT2 protein levels of the two treatment groups were higher than those of the CUMS group (EAAT1: $i$P$/i$ = 0.00 versus the XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.00 versus the Flu group; EAAT2: $i$P$/i$ = 0.001 versus the XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.046 versus the Flu group), whereas the difference in MOD of the EAAT1 and EAAT2 proteins between the control group and the two treatment groups was not significant (EAAT1: $i$P$/i$ = 1.00 versus the XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 1.00 versus the Flu group; EAAT2: $i$P$/i$ = 0.337 versus the XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.410 versus the Flu group).

However, there was a downward trend in the expression of GFAP mRNA in the CUMS group compared with that in the control group, although the difference between the two groups was not significant ($i$P$/i$ = 0.059); the downward trend could be substantially reversed by XYS and Flu ($i$P$/i$ = 0.032, $i$P$/i$ = 0.011, Fig. 6 e), and the significant differences were valid.

The Nemenyi method was used for comparative analysis of the real-time PCR data of GFAP and EAAT1 and the Western blot data of EAAT2 between groups. Values are presented as medians and interquartile ranges. Then, Sidak’s method was used for comparative analysis of real-time PCR data of EAAT2 and NeuN and Western blot data of GFAP, EAAT1 and NeuN between groups. Values are presented as the mean ± SEM ($i$n$/i$ = 5), * $i$P$/i$ &lt; 0.05, ** $i$P$/i$ &lt; 0.01 versus the control group; # $i$P$/i$ &lt; 0.05, ## $i$P$/i$ &lt; 0.01 versus the CUMS group As shown in Fig. 6 b, the expression of EAAT1 protein in the PFC was obviously lower in mice exposed to CUMS than that in the control group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.00), and the downward trend could be weakened by XYS and Flu ($i$P$/i$ = 0.002, $i$P$/i$ = 0.00). The expression of EAAT1 mRNA in the PFC of mice in the CUMS group presented a downward trend compared with that in the control group, but the phenomenon could be reversed by XYS and Flu treatment ($i$P$/i$ = 0.019, $i$P$/i$ = 0.019, Fig. 6 f), and the significant differences were valid. As shown in Fig. 6 c, compared with the control group, the expression of EAAT2 in the PFC of mice in the CUMS group declined significantly ($i$P$/i$ = 0.006), and the decline could be weakened by Flu ($i$P$/i$ = 0.027), but the difference between the XYS group and the CUMS group was not obvious ($i$P$/i$ = 0.138). The expression of EAAT2 mRNA in mice in the CUMS group declined obviously ($i$P$/i$ = 0.00 versus control group), and EAAT2 expression in the XYS and Flu groups was obviously elevated compared with that in the CUMS group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.00, $i$P$/i$ = 0.00); furthermore, the level of EAAT2 mRNA in mice in the Flu group was higher than that in the control group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.12, Fig. 6 g). As shown in Fig. 6 d, the expression of NeuN in the PFC of mice in the CUMS group was obviously lower than that of the control group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.001) but increased significantly in mice in the XYS and Flu treatment groups (CUMS group versus XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.00; CUMS group versus Flu group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.00), and the differences among the control, XYS, and Flu groups were not significant (control group versus XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.851, control group versus Flu group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.950). The expression of NeuN mRNA in the CUMS groups presented a downward trend compared with that in the control group, but the difference between the control and CUMS groups was not significant ($i$P$/i$ = 0.416); furthermore, the expression of NeuN mRNA in the XYS and Flu groups was obviously higher than that in the CUMS group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.032, $i$P$/i$ = 0.003, Fig. 6 h), but the significant differences were valid. Effects of XYS on glutamic acid levels in the PFC As shown in Fig.  7 , the level of total glutamic acid in the PFC of mice exposed to CUMS increased significantly compared with that in the control group ($i$P$/i$ = 0.00); this outcome could be inhibited by XYS and Flu ($i$P$/i$ = 0.011, $i$P$/i$ = 0.001), and the differences among the control, XYS, and Flu groups were not significant (control group versus XYS group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.525, control group versus Flu group, $i$P$/i$ = 0.602).

Xiaoyaosan significantly improve the general motor and pleasure loss behaviors. More importantly, exposures to CUMS for 21 days induced damage in functions of astrocytes and neurons and triggered the release of glutamate in prefrontal cortical, which were reversed by treatment with Xiaoyaosan partially, such as improvement in morphology and quantity of nerve cells in the PFC, regulating the expression of the GFAP, EAAT1, NeuN proteins and EAAT2 gene, decreasing the content of the glutamate cortex in the PFC of mice, which may be associated with depressive-like behavior. CUMS is a common method used to establish a stress diathesis model of depression in modern research that simulates the various stimuli, difficulties, stresses and blows faced by depression patients through long-term, diverse and random stimulation of mice, and these cannot be solved, which will lead to clinical manifestations such as desperate helplessness, low mood, loss of interest, and sleepiness [ 19 , 20 ]. Meanwhile, the C57BL/6 J mouse has a homogeneous response to stress, so it is often used in stress-related studies [ 21 , 22 ]. Therefore, this study established a 21-day CUMS mouse model and observed the intervention effects of XYS on the following aspects: changes in behavior, AST functions, neuronal function, and glutamate transporter function in the PFC of mice. Rodents can rapidly adjust their physiological status under different kinds of stress. In this study, the OFT, FST and SPT were performed to assess possible depressive behaviors in CUMS-induced mice. The OFT can reflect an animal’s exploration characteristics and fear of a new environment, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate the animal’s spontaneous activity, exploration behavior, and the state of depression and anxiety [ 23 ]. In this study, the OFT results showed that the central zone residence time of CUMS mice was prolonged compared with that of controls, but the difference was not significant; however, entries into the central zone and total distance moved in CUMS mice were significantly reduced. XYS and FLU showed significant improvement in the total distance moved by CUMS mice, while improvements in residence time and the number of entries into the central zone of CUMS mice were not obvious; thus, the OFT results showed less evidence for CUMS-induced depressant-like behavior and antidepressant-like effects of XYS and FLU. Notably, it is not a coincidental phenomenon that there were differences in the outcomes of different behavior tests within previous studies [ 24 ]. The FST is one of the most commonly used assays for the study of depressive-like behavior in rodents. This test has been extensively used because it involves the exposure of animals to stress, which was shown to have a role in the tendency for major depression [ 25 ]. Here, we found that the immobility time of mice exposed to CUMS for 21 days was significantly longer than that of the controls; this outcome was in contrast to the CUMS mice treated with Flu, and XYS showed no treatment effect on the immobility time of mice exposed to CUMS. In addition, the decline in responsiveness to rewards is also an important feature of depression. At present, the percentage of sucrose preference as an effective objective measure of the decline in animal pleasure is used in most studies [ 26 ]. Here, a significant increase in sucrose consumption in the CUMS group was measured after 21 days and was relieved by XYS and Flu. Similar to the results discussed in previous studies [ 27 , 28 ], our study also showed that in CUMS animal behaviors as general motor and pleasure loss, XYS and Flu play similar treatment roles. An increasing number of studies have shown that changes in AST function may be involved in the occurrence of a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases [ 29 ]. Depression or long-term psychological stress can cause changes in the morphology, function and plasticity of ASTs, suggesting that changes in AST function may be one of the related mechanisms of stress pathogenesis. Other studies have found that ASTs are also involved in the active regulation of neurons, the most important regulatory mechanism of which is control of the metabolism of glutamate in extracellular fluid. ASTs can transport extracellular glutamate into glial cells through the functional glutamate transporter and reduce the extracellular glutamate concentration, thereby alleviating the toxic effects of glutamate [ 30 ]. GFAP acts as a specific scaffolding protein for ASTs, and its expression changes play an important role in the stress response. Banasr found that the expression of GFAP in the PFC of rats with agnostic chronic stress was significantly decreased, which also indicated the decline of AST function in the PFC of chronically stressed rats. When glutamate is released into the synaptic cleft, it will occupy and activate glutamate receptors in synaptic neurons and ASTs, and subsequently, glutamate is rapidly transferred out of the synaptic gap by a family of serosal EAATs located in neurons and ASTs. [ 31 ]. Since extracellular glutamate-free enzyme systems are involved, extracellular excess glutamate clearance relies primarily on EAAT transport. AST EAAT1 and EAAT2 have high affinity for glutamate and are the main mediators of glutamate clearance in the human synaptic cleft, playing an important role in excitatory amino acid recycling, neuronal damage protection and termination of excitability signals [ 32 ]. The dysfunction of these mediators can cause excessive accumulation of glutamate, leading to excitotoxicity of neurons and involvement in the development of various neurodegenerative diseases [ 33 ]. Neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) is a specific marker for the maturation of vertebrate neurons. This molecule is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of most neurons of the vertebrate nervous system and is widely used to study, diagnose and identify mature neurons. Previous studies reported that the expression of GFAP in the PFC of rats with chronic stress was significantly decreased, expression of EAAT1 and EAAT2 was significantly decreased in the hippocampus and cortex of acquired helpless rats, and neuronal loss was found in the CUMS model relative to the control group [ 34 , 35 ]. Based on these results, we hypothesized that chronic unpredictable mild stress would lead to decreased expression of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN and an increase in glutamate content in the PFC of mice, which could be reversed by XYS treatment. Interestingly, consistent with our assumptions, the expression of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN proteins in the PFC of mice decreased, and the glutamate content increased significantly compared with that of controls. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting showed that the expression of GFAP protein in CUMS mice was reduced significantly. As mentioned above, GFAP acts as an AST marker, which can help ASTs keep their mechanical strength and shape; NeuN serves as a reliable marker of mature neuron; and NeuN expression levels have been used to directly assess neuronal loss or death [ 36 , 37 ]. Clinical studies have demonstrated that human postmortem brain studies have revealed reduced density and size of neurons and glial cells in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in major depressive disorder (MDD) [ 38 ]. A previous study showed that a decrease in NeuN and GFAP mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus of mice exposed to CUMS was observed [ 39 ]. In the present study, our observations of reduced protein expression levels, as well as the immunoreactivity, of GFAP and NeuN in CUMS mice were in agreement with those data, except the GFAP and NeuN mRNA levels in mouse PFC. These results were also observed in a previous study conducted by Michelle J. Chandley, PhD et al., who found that the expression levels of a glia-related gene, GFAP, analyzed by real-time PCR isolated from homogenized tissue that was punch-dissected from the LC and frontal cortex regions of decedents who had MDD and tissue samples from psychiatrically healthy controls, were similar, while the protein expression of GFAP and GFAP immunoreactivity were reduced in MDD samples compared with those in matched control samples [ 40 ]. In addition, we observed a significant reduction in GFAP immunoreactivity, as demonstrated by Western blotting and in GFAP-immunostained tissue sections. Reduced GFAP immunoreactivity in depression animal models has been reported for hippocampi and PFC [ 41 ]. Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that the reduction in GFAP immunoreactivity in the present study may be a regulatory event in existing ASTs. Additionally, NeuN expression was assayed by Western blotting. and NeuN-immunostained tissue sections showed a decrease in neuronal cells. These results are further supported by a series of related studies, which reported that NeuN protein and gene expression in CUMS animal models was reduced in hippocampi [ 42 , 43 ] and PFC [ 44 ]. However, the mRNA expression of NeuN in the PFC of CUMS mice observed in the present study was similar to that in mice of the control group, indicating the result was not accidental. Liu et al. found that NeuN protein and gene expression in a chronic unpredictable stress model of depression was not reduced compared with that of a control group [ 45 ]. Ding et al. reported a decrease in NeuN mRNA levels; however, these results could not be further confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. These results suggest that the negative expression of NeuN mRNA was attributable to the differential timing of protein and gene expression under the action of CUMS and drugs rather than an elevation in RNA expression. Our study also indicated an increase in GFAP and NeuN in the XYS and FLU treatment groups, which showed that the changes in GFAP and NeuN in the CUMS mice can be reversed to some extent by both FLU and XYS treatments. As reported in previous studies, the cerebrospinal fluid levels of Glu in depressed patients were increased, as evaluated by proton magnetic spectroscopy [ 46 ]. Elevated Glu and glycine levels in patients with major depression were also reported. Another study demonstrated that the higher levels of Glu in patients were significantly different from those in healthy volunteers and that the levels decreased as a response to therapy [ 47 ]. Interestingly, in agreement with these previous studies, our study showed increased Glu in CUMS mice, and this alteration could be effectively restored by XYS treatment. As mentioned in the Introduction, the main function of EAAT1 is the clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft. That is, if there is a problem in the EAAT1 and EAAT2 system, increased synthesis of Glu and excitotoxicity in the extracellular space occur [ 48 ]. In agreement with this theory, lower rates of EAAT1 and EAAT2 activity are considered a cause of depressive disorders [ 49 ]. A study showed that patients who suffered from MDD showed significant downregulation of EAAT1 and EAAT2 in postmortem cerebral cortex [ 50 ]. Another study reported that levels of GLAST and GLT-1 could be changed by exposure to chronic stress [ 51 ]. In the present study, our results showed that the reduced expression of EAAT2 protein and mRNA and EAAT1 protein in the PFC of CUMS mice was in agreement with similar studies, with the exception of EAAT1 mRNA. Additionally, the negative changes in EAAT1 mRNA in the PFC of mice in the CUMS group are also not accidental. It was shown in a previous study that 21-day CUMS significantly reduced the expression of EAAT2 protein in the hippocampus of an MCAO animal model, while EAAT2 mRNA expression levels did not change significantly [ 52 ]. Together, these findings indicate that the inconsistency in EAAT1 protein and gene expression might be attributable to the differential timing of protein and gene expression under the action of CUMS and drugs. Our results also indicated that a reduction in EAAT1 and EAAT2 could be reversed by XYS or FLU treatment. Consistent with a previous study [ 53 ], pathological changes such as decreased cortical neuronal cells, and disordered arrangement, nuclear loss, nucleus light staining, swelling, fragmentation, and even vacuolization and nuclear pyknosis. All of the above changes in CUMS mice could be reversed by XYS and Flu treatments. Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that CUMS would lead to decreased expression of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN and an increase in glutamate content in the PFC of mice, which could be reversed by XYS treatment. Conclusion In conclusion, XYS treatment appears to possibly improve the changes in depressive mice induced by CUMS by regulating the functions of ASTs and EAATs in the PFC. This finding is basically consistent with the hypothesis that CUMS would lead to decreased expression of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN and an increase in glutamate content in the PFC of mice, which could be reversed by XYS treatment to a certain level. While the findings are important for our understanding of the underlying neurobiology associated with antidepressant action, they provide a theoretical foundation for the clinical application of XYS as an anti-depression therapy. Furthermore, the exact mechanism of action of XYS on GFAP function has yet to be further developed in conjunction with clinical and in vitro cell experiments.
