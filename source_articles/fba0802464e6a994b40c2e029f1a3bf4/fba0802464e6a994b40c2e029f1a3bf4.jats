Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), which initiates rapid signal transmission in the synapse before its reuptake into the surrounding glia, specifically astrocytes (ASTs). The astrocytic excitatory amino acid transporters 1 (EAAT1) and 2 (EAAT2) are the major transporters that take up synaptic glutamate to maintain optimal extracellular glutamic levels, thus preventing accumulation in the synaptic cleft and ensuing excitotoxicity. Growing evidence has shown that excitotoxicity is associated with depression. Therefore, we hypothesized that the underlying antidepressant-like mechanism of Xiaoyaosan (XYS), a Chinese herbal formula, may be related to the regulation of astrocytic EAATs. Therefore, we studied the antidepressant mechanism of XYS on the basis of EAAT dysfunction in ASTs.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Eighty adult C57BL/6 J mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: a control group, a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) group, a Xiaoyaosan (XYS) treatment group and a fluoxetine hydrochloride (Flu) treatment group. Except for the control group, mice in the other groups all received chronic unpredictable mild stress for 21 days. Mice in the control and CUMS groups received gavage administration with 0.5 mL of normal saline (NS) for 21 days, and mice in the XYS and Flu treatment groups were administered dosages of 0.25 g/kg/d and 2.6 mg/kg/d by gavage. The effects of XYS on the depressive-like behavioral tests, including the open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SPT), were examined. The glutamate (Glu) concentrations of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were detected with colorimetry. The morphology of neurons in the PFC was observed by Nissl staining. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), NeuN, EAAT1 and EAAT2 proteins in the PFC of mice was detected by using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the expression of the GFAP, NeuN, EAAT1 and EAAT2 genes in the PFC of mice.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The results of behavioral tests showed that CUMS-induced mice exhibited depressive-like behavior, which could be improved in some tests with XYS and Flu treatment. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of GFAP, NeuN, EAAT1 and EAAT2 in the PFC of CUMS mice were significantly lower than those in the control group, and these changes could be reversed by XYS and Flu. The results of qPCR analysis showed that the expression of GFAP, NeuN, EAAT1 and EAAT2 mRNAs in the PFC of CUMS mice was not significantly changed, with the exception of EAAT2, compared with that of the control group, while the expression of the above mRNAs was significantly higher in the XYS and Flu groups than that in the CUMS group.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">XYS may exert antidepressant-like effects by improving the functions of AST and EAATs and attenuating glutamate-induced neuronal damage in the frontal cortex.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Chronic unpredictable mild stress</kwd><kwd>Xiaoyaosan</kwd><kwd>AST</kwd><kwd>EAATs</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">81630104</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">81473597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia-xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia-xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Beijing Natural Sciences Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">7152093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Xiu-fang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12906_2019_Article_2613.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine &amp;

Previous studies have found that depression is closely related to stress; however, to date, the mechanism by which stress induces behavioral disorders is still unclear. Many central neurology and clinical symptoms have confirmed that the cerebral cortex is an important physiological system of emotional activity, and its dysfunction may be the main cause of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">In the past, glial cells were only considered complementary partners for neurons. Astrocytes (ASTs) are the largest and most abundant glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], accounting for approximately 20% of all glial cells. In recent years, people have developed a new understanding of the function of glial cells. An increasing number of studies have shown that changes in AST function may be involved in the occurrence of a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Depression or long-term psychological stress can cause changes in the morphology, function and plasticity of ASTs, suggesting that the change in AST function may be one of the mechanisms related to stress pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is released into the synaptic cleft by glutamatergic neurons and then taken up by the AST glutamate transporter. AST uptake of glutamate involves both Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent and non-Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent systems, where the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent system occupies a dominant position in the glutamate transport process of the central nervous system by virtue of its high affinity for glutamate. The Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent glutamate transporters of ASTs were first isolated from rat brain tissue and named GLT1 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2, EAAT2) and GLAST (EAAT1), which are responsible for the high uptake of glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Long-term stress can cause AST damage and EAAT dysfunction, and thus, the stress-induced glutamate level in the synaptic cleft cannot be reduced, leading to the induction of excitatory amino acid toxicity and damage to neuronal plasticity.</p><p id="Par21">Xiaoyaosan (XYS), a Chinese materia medica, has long been used for treating the syndrome of liver qi stagnation and spleen deficiency, a syndrome closely related to mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression, in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The book of Taiping Huimin Heji Jufang in the Song Dynasty noted that XYS comprises the following eight Chinese herbs: Radix Bupleuri (root of <italic>Bupleurum chinense</italic> DC.), Radix Paeoniae Alba (root of <italic>Paeonia lactiflora</italic> Pall.), Radix Angelicae Sinensis (root of <italic>Angelica sinensis</italic> (Oliv.)

Although there has been much research on the antidepressant mechanism of XYS, few studies have demonstrated an association between the antidepressant effects of XYS and AST and EAAT functions. Furthermore, many studies have shown that cerebral cortical glial cell density is significantly reduced in patients with depression, accompanied by a decrease in AST markers, and GFAP expression in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex (PFC) was observed to be significantly downregulated in a depression model, while many ASTs were atrophied. Additionally, our previous research showed that XYS may have therapeutic effects on depression-like behaviors induced by CUMS in mice, possibly mediated by modulation of the glutamate/glutamine cycle and the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, measuring the astrocytic excitatory amino acid transporters in depressive rodents can potentially aid our understanding of the roles that AST and EAAT function in PFC play in depression, as well as explain the antidepressant effects of XYS.</p><p id="Par22">In this study, we investigated the alterations of AST and EAAT functions in CUMS mice. Specifically, behavioral tests such as FST, OFT, and NSF were evaluated in CUMS mice. The protein and mRNA levels, along with the immunoreactivity, of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN in the PFC of CUMS mice were measured, as these indicators are considered to reflect the functions of ASTs, EAATs, and neurons. In addition, the glutamate concentration and pathological changes were measured.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par23">Eighty specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 J male mice (No. 11400700088123) aged 10 weeks were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., and raised in an SPF animal room with a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C and humidity of 30–40%.

Notably, it is not a coincidental phenomenon that there were differences in the outcomes of different behavior tests within previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The FST is one of the most commonly used assays for the study of depressive-like behavior in rodents. This test has been extensively used because it involves the exposure of animals to stress, which was shown to have a role in the tendency for major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Here, we found that the immobility time of mice exposed to CUMS for 21 days was significantly longer than that of the controls; this outcome was in contrast to the CUMS mice treated with Flu, and XYS showed no treatment effect on the immobility time of mice exposed to CUMS. In addition, the decline in responsiveness to rewards is also an important feature of depression. At present, the percentage of sucrose preference as an effective objective measure of the decline in animal pleasure is used in most studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Here, a significant increase in sucrose consumption in the CUMS group was measured after 21 days and was relieved by XYS and Flu. Similar to the results discussed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], our study also showed that in CUMS animal behaviors as general motor and pleasure loss, XYS and Flu play similar treatment roles.</p><p id="Par53">An increasing number of studies have shown that changes in AST function may be involved in the occurrence of a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Depression or long-term psychological stress can cause changes in the morphology, function and plasticity of ASTs, suggesting that changes in AST function may be one of the related mechanisms of stress pathogenesis. Other studies have found that ASTs are also involved in the active regulation of neurons, the most important regulatory mechanism of which is control of the metabolism of glutamate in extracellular fluid. ASTs can transport extracellular glutamate into glial cells through the functional glutamate transporter and reduce the extracellular glutamate concentration, thereby alleviating the toxic effects of glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. GFAP acts as a specific scaffolding protein for ASTs, and its expression changes play an important role in the stress response. Banasr found that the expression of GFAP in the PFC of rats with agnostic chronic stress was significantly decreased, which also indicated the decline of AST function in the PFC of chronically stressed rats. When glutamate is released into the synaptic cleft, it will occupy and activate glutamate receptors in synaptic neurons and ASTs, and subsequently, glutamate is rapidly transferred out of the synaptic gap by a family of serosal EAATs located in neurons and ASTs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Since extracellular glutamate-free enzyme systems are involved, extracellular excess glutamate clearance relies primarily on EAAT transport. AST EAAT1 and EAAT2 have high affinity for glutamate and are the main mediators of glutamate clearance in the human synaptic cleft, playing an important role in excitatory amino acid recycling, neuronal damage protection and termination of excitability signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The dysfunction of these mediators can cause excessive accumulation of glutamate, leading to excitotoxicity of neurons and involvement in the development of various neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) is a specific marker for the maturation of vertebrate neurons. This molecule is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of most neurons of the vertebrate nervous system and is widely used to study, diagnose and identify mature neurons. Previous studies reported that the expression of GFAP in the PFC of rats with chronic stress was significantly decreased, expression of EAAT1 and EAAT2 was significantly decreased in the hippocampus and cortex of acquired helpless rats, and neuronal loss was found in the CUMS model relative to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Based on these results, we hypothesized that chronic unpredictable mild stress would lead to decreased expression of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN and an increase in glutamate content in the PFC of mice, which could be reversed by XYS treatment.</p><p id="Par54">Interestingly, consistent with our assumptions, the expression of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN proteins in the PFC of mice decreased, and the glutamate content increased significantly compared with that of controls.</p><p id="Par55">The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting showed that the expression of GFAP protein in CUMS mice was reduced significantly. As mentioned above, GFAP acts as an AST marker, which can help ASTs keep their mechanical strength and shape; NeuN serves as a reliable marker of mature neuron; and NeuN expression levels have been used to directly assess neuronal loss or death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Clinical studies have demonstrated that human postmortem brain studies have revealed reduced density and size of neurons and glial cells in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in major depressive disorder (MDD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A previous study showed that a decrease in NeuN and GFAP mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus of mice exposed to CUMS was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In the present study, our observations of reduced protein expression levels, as well as the immunoreactivity, of GFAP and NeuN in CUMS mice were in agreement with those data, except the GFAP and NeuN mRNA levels in mouse PFC. These results were also observed in a previous study conducted by Michelle J. Chandley, PhD et al., who found that the expression levels of a glia-related gene, GFAP, analyzed by real-time PCR isolated from homogenized tissue that was punch-dissected from the LC and frontal cortex regions of decedents who had MDD and tissue samples from psychiatrically healthy controls, were similar, while the protein expression of GFAP and GFAP immunoreactivity were reduced in MDD samples compared with those in matched control samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition, we observed a significant reduction in GFAP immunoreactivity, as demonstrated by Western blotting and in GFAP-immunostained tissue sections. Reduced GFAP immunoreactivity in depression animal models has been reported for hippocampi and PFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that the reduction in GFAP immunoreactivity in the present study may be a regulatory event in existing ASTs. Additionally, NeuN expression was assayed by Western blotting. and NeuN-immunostained tissue sections showed a decrease in neuronal cells. These results are further supported by a series of related studies, which reported that NeuN protein and gene expression in CUMS animal models was reduced in hippocampi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and PFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, the mRNA expression of NeuN in the PFC of CUMS mice observed in the present study was similar to that in mice of the control group, indicating the result was not accidental. Liu et al. found that NeuN protein and gene expression in a chronic unpredictable stress model of depression was not reduced compared with that of a control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Ding et al. reported a decrease in NeuN mRNA levels; however, these results could not be further confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. These results suggest that the negative expression of NeuN mRNA was attributable to the differential timing of protein and gene expression under the action of CUMS and drugs rather than an elevation in RNA expression. Our study also indicated an increase in GFAP and NeuN in the XYS and FLU treatment groups, which showed that the changes in GFAP and NeuN in the CUMS mice can be reversed to some extent by both FLU and XYS treatments.</p><p id="Par56">As reported in previous studies, the cerebrospinal fluid levels of Glu in depressed patients were increased, as evaluated by proton magnetic spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Elevated Glu and glycine levels in patients with major depression were also reported. Another study demonstrated that the higher levels of Glu in patients were significantly different from those in healthy volunteers and that the levels decreased as a response to therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Interestingly, in agreement with these previous studies, our study showed increased Glu in CUMS mice, and this alteration could be effectively restored by XYS treatment.</p><p id="Par57">As mentioned in the Introduction, the main function of EAAT1 is the clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft. That is, if there is a problem in the EAAT1 and EAAT2 system, increased synthesis of Glu and excitotoxicity in the extracellular space occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In agreement with this theory, lower rates of EAAT1 and EAAT2 activity are considered a cause of depressive disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A study showed that patients who suffered from MDD showed significant downregulation of EAAT1 and EAAT2 in postmortem cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Another study reported that levels of GLAST and GLT-1 could be changed by exposure to chronic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In the present study, our results showed that the reduced expression of EAAT2 protein and mRNA and EAAT1 protein in the PFC of CUMS mice was in agreement with similar studies, with the exception of EAAT1 mRNA. Additionally, the negative changes in EAAT1 mRNA in the PFC of mice in the CUMS group are also not accidental. It was shown in a previous study that 21-day CUMS significantly reduced the expression of EAAT2 protein in the hippocampus of an MCAO animal model, while EAAT2 mRNA expression levels did not change significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Together, these findings indicate that the inconsistency in EAAT1 protein and gene expression might be attributable to the differential timing of protein and gene expression under the action of CUMS and drugs. Our results also indicated that a reduction in EAAT1 and EAAT2 could be reversed by XYS or FLU treatment.</p><p id="Par58">Consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], pathological changes such as decreased cortical neuronal cells, and disordered arrangement, nuclear loss, nucleus light staining, swelling, fragmentation, and even vacuolization and nuclear pyknosis. All of the above changes in CUMS mice could be reversed by XYS and Flu treatments.</p><p id="Par59">Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that CUMS would lead to decreased expression of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN and an increase in glutamate content in the PFC of mice, which could be reversed by XYS treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par60">In conclusion, XYS treatment appears to possibly improve the changes in depressive mice induced by CUMS by regulating the functions of ASTs and EAATs in the PFC. This finding is basically consistent with the hypothesis that CUMS would lead to decreased expression of GFAP, EAAT1, EAAT2, and NeuN and an increase in glutamate content in the PFC of mice, which could be reversed by XYS treatment to a certain level. While the findings are important for our understanding of the underlying neurobiology associated with antidepressant action, they provide a theoretical foundation for the clinical application of XYS as an anti-depression therapy. Furthermore, the exact mechanism of action of XYS on GFAP function has yet to be further developed in conjunction with clinical and in vitro cell experiments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>The experiments were conceived and designed by LY, ZXJ and CJX.
