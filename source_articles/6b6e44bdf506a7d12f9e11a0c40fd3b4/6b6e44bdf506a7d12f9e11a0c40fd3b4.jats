A variety of complications following AMI have been identified, including ventricular septal or papillary muscle rupture, apical left-ventricular thrombus formation, and pericardial effusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Approximately 17 million or more deaths for cardiovascular disease occur annually and the mortality rate for AMI patients accounts for 13% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Based on the statistics, it is predicted that there will be 16 million people in 2020 and 7 million more in 2030 suffering from AMI in China, posing great risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In recent years, however, the underlying cellular mechanisms of cardiovascular disorders have been studied extensively, of which microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted much research interests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">miRNAs, a group of small non-coding RNAs, have been reported to extensively play a pivotal role in multiple cellular biological processes such as cell apoptosis and proliferation, particularly in the cardiovascular system where miRNA regulate physiological and pathological events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, several miRNAs, such as miR-451, miR-203, and miR-34, exert suppressive functions over cancer stemness and drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently, a number of miRNAs have been identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AMI, including miR-497, miR-19a, and miR-499 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Besides, the miR-17-92 family and its paralogs have been reported to be involved in the process of angiogenesis following AMI, or other dyslipidemia and related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. miR-18a, belonging to the miR-17-92 family, has emerged as a novel treatment for brain vascular diseases as a regulator of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, whether miR-18a is involved in fine-tuning the function of cardiomyocytes requires further investigations. It is suggested that miR-18a regulates the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and is able to modulate neuron plasticity and development, which is a pharmaceutical target in treating neural development and psychiatry disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Considering the association with coronary artery disease, BDNF has also been reported as a therapeutic candidate for MI by ameliorating cardiac ischemic injury and suppressing cardiomyocyte apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Additionally, the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis has been reported to be involved in miR-28 regulated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the present study, the goal is to investigate miR-18a function in AMI in a rat model and the underlying mechanisms. It has been found that inhibition of miR-18a could upregulate BDNF, offering protection against AMI by inactivating the Akt/mTOR axis. Expectedly, the present study may provide a scientific rationale for the modulation of miRNAs in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animal treatment</title><p id="Par28">Animal use and experimental procedures in this study were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University.

The rats were anaesthetized using 3% pentobarbital sodium (P3761, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA) by intraperitoneal injection and monitored by a lead II electrocardiogram (ECG). Then, 16 rats were treated with sham-operation (the chest cavity of rats was opened and then statured), which served as a control. The remaining 38 rats were used for AMI rat model establishment, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Briefly, the MI was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary arteries (LAD) at 2 mm below the left atrial appendage (LAA) of rats. Regional ischemia was confirmed by visual inspection for pallor or cyanosis. The AMI model was considered to be successfully established if lead ST segment elevation lasts for at least 15 min.

Emerging evidence has highlighted the regulatory role of miRNAs in cardiac pathophysiology. For example, miR-22 down-regulation has been revealed to activate cardiac autophagy, which can contribute to improvement of cardiac function following MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. With the purpose to uncover the role of miR-18a in AMI, the present study has demonstrated that down-regulation of miR-18a can promote autophagy and inhibit senescence of H9c2 cells induced by hypoxia by upregulating BDNF and inactivating the Akt/mTOR axis, playing an important role in protecting the cells from AMI.</p><p id="Par50">Initially, it was discovered that miR-18a was highly expressed in cardiomyocytes of rats with AMI, while, in contrary, BDNF exhibited a low expression level. Consistent with the findings, miR-133, miR-663b, and miR-1291 have all been found to be highly expressed in AMI according to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is worth noting that higher levels of miR-208b and miR-34a have been demonstrated to reflect higher risk of death or heart failure in left ventricular remodeling following AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Decreased BDNF expression has also been validated as a consequence of cardiac dysfunction induced by doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Besides, 3′UTR of BDNF contains conserved binding sites for various miRNAs, of which miR-1, miR-10b, miR-155, and miR-191 have been displayed to regulate BDNF expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These findings also confirmed that BDNF is a target gene of miR-18a by luciferase reporter assay.</p><p id="Par51">Additionally, down-regulation of miR-18a was proven to exert encouraging effects on cell autophagy by promoting BDNF expression and inhibiting the Akt/mTOR axis, which was reflected by higher levels of Beclin1, LC3-II/I, and lower levels of p62. Similar to the results of the present study, miR-21 has been indicated to suppress autophagy of H9c2 cells via Akt/mTOR axis in cardiac hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved pathway within cells to degrade unnecessary or dysfunctional components, and to maintain autophagy is essential in cardiac homeostasis control under certain stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Beclin1, a key molecule in the autophagic machinery that can be regulated by miRNAs, has been suggested to regulate autophagy in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Besides, the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I has been found to be reduced when the mTOR axis was activated, preventing against myocardial injury during the acute stage of ischemia/reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Importantly, the increased level of LC3-II has been observed as a marker of activated autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Moreover, p62 has been identified as a substrate that can be degraded via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway through LC3 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that BDNF is neuroprotective by regulating the autophagy of oxygen-deprived cells through interaction with the Akt/mTOR/ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6 K) axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The function of mTOR pathway has been shown to negatively regulate autophagy, the activation of which can be partially associated with miR-222 induced autophagy suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Furthermore, H9c2 cells transfected with miR-18a inhibitors exhibited an enhanced SOD activity and diminished MDA level, accompanied by up-regulation of BDNF and inactivation of Akt/mTOR axis. This result verified the inhibitory effects of downregulating miR-18a on cellular senescence. Cellular senescence can be defined as cell cycle arrest as a result of DNA damage or other stress, which is featured with enhanced SA-β-gal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The present study has revealed that the proportion of SA-β-gal positive cells was decreased in H9c2 cells when treated with miR-18a inhibitors, suggesting that cellular senescence was suppressed when miR-18a was inhibited. Additionally, according to an investigation on senescence of mesenchymal stem cells, more SA-β-gal positive cells were observed in cells when the Akt/mTOR axis was activated, suggesting that activation of the Akt/mTOR axis may be correlated to enhanced cell senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The suppressed level of MDA and the activated level of SOD have been proven to be signs of AMI amelioration in a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Researchers have mentioned that BDNF can elevate SOD expression level in hippocampal neurons of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which is consistent with the findings obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">In conclusion, the study proposes that down-regulation of miR-18a inhibits senescence while promoting autophagy of cardiomyocytes in rats with AMI via upregulating BDNF and inactivating Akt/mTOR axis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).
