Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma is an effective tool that could overcome this barrier. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of plasma to enhance spore germination, the initial step in fungal colonization, using <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic>, a beneficial filamentous fungus used in the fermentation industry. Treating fungal spores in background solutions of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and potato dextrose broth (PDB) with micro dielectric barrier discharge plasma using nitrogen gas for 2 and 5 min, respectively, significantly increased the germination percentage. Spore swelling, the first step in germination, was accelerated following plasma treatment, indicating that plasma may be involved in loosening the spore surface. Plasma treatment depolarized spore membranes, elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and activated mpkA, a MAP kinase, and the transcription of several germination-associated genes. Our results suggest that plasma enhances fungal spore germination by stimulating spore swelling, depolarizing the cell membrane, and activating calcium and MAPK signaling.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi"

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Fermentation with microorganisms is used to produce various compounds in industries related to food, medicine, and bioremediation such as antibiotics, alcohols, amino acids, enzymes, organic acids, and other bioproducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The demand for industrial level fermentation techniques using microorganisms is increasing worldwide, with many countries considering microbial resources to be important assets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The Nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources has triggered a worldwide search for effective microbial strains as well as the development of efficient utilization tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Compared to chemical processes, the use of microorganisms in fermentation has several advantages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Microorganisms are able to multiply fast using a variety of substrates, and microbial reactions are very specific and can be conducted at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure, leading to high production levels. Despite these advantages, certain technical barriers, such as inconsistent survival and stability during cultivation and variable microbial activity, have hindered the efficient application of microorganisms in fermentation. The stable, high density microbial cultivation required for the production of compounds on an industrial scale cannot be achieved under natural culture conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Technologies required for the development of stable and high-density cultures are being actively investigated. For instance, genetic engineering tools are frequently used to generate recombinant strains with improved vitality and functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; however, concerns regarding genetically modified organisms (GMO) and their products have limited the widespread use of this technology. Non-conventional methods such as high pressure, electric fields, and ultrasound have also been applied to improve the yield and productivity of microbial fermentation, yet information regarding these methods is scarce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma has also been explored as an emerging alternative tool. Plasma is an ionized gas composed of charged and excited particles, reactive neutral species (ROS and RNS), and UV photons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Since non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma generates various reactive species, a broad spectrum of effects ranging from inactivation to activation may be produced depending on the dosage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) produced by plasma account for a broad range of effects exerted by plasma. Many studies have demonstrated that plasma-generated RONS play a major role in inactivating microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Plasma treatment can also stimulate tissue regeneration, cell proliferation, and stem cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, thus plasma-generated RONS may have an important role in these activities. RONS are important signaling molecules that regulate a wide variety of biological and physiological functions, such as cellular growth, gene activation, and the regulation of chemical reactions in living organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. ROS have been shown to regulate conidial germination and germ tube development in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> and <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, nitric oxide (NO) regulates reproductive processes such as appressorium formation, sporangiophore development, and conidial germination, as well as morphogenesis and pathogenesis in many fungi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, NO regulates nitrogen metabolism during nitrate assimilation in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and ROS and NO coordinately regulate polar germ tube growth in <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> Westend f. sp. <italic>Tritici</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Enhanced microbial cell growth and differentiation is required for the stable, high-density cultivation of microorganisms, leading to efficient fermentation. Compared to the anti-microbial effect of plasma, the activation of microbial vitality by plasma remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we investigated the role of non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma in enhancing the initial cell differentiation in the fermenting fungus, <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic>, with particular reference to the underlying mechanisms. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> is a beneficial filamentous fungus belonging to the phylum Ascomycetes and is widely used to ferment alcohol and soy sauce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

The pH of PDB (~5) was generally lower than that of PBS (~7); however, no significant change in pH was observed after plasma treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). The difference in the pH of PBS and PDB may affect the interactions between plasma-generated reactive species and fungal spores; however, our study provides no evidence supporting this hypothesis. Another possibility is that reactions between plasma-generated ROS and RNS and the chemicals in PDB may reduce the levels of reactive species, thus longer treatment times may be required to achieve the same effect. Since potato extract is a major component in PDB and the antioxidant compounds such as carotenoids and phenolic compounds are present in potato peel and flesh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, plasma generated ROS and RNS are likely to be scavenged by antioxidants in PDB.</p><p id="Par21">Our findings suggest several possibilities regarding the mechanism(s) underlying the activation of spore germination by plasma (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>): (1) plasma-generated reactive species may enhance spore swelling, likely by loosening the cell wall via oxidation, and (2) plasma-generated reactive species depolarize the spore membrane by increasing the activation of membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion influx systems, which may elevate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and activate signaling pathways (e.g. MAPK signaling) that enhance the expression of germination-associated genes. In this study, plasma-treated spores swelled a little faster than the control spores. The enhanced swelling of plasma-treated spores may be the result of cell wall loosening via plasma-induced oxidation, a notion partially supported by our observations.

Consequently, the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level is elevated, triggering many cellular processes such as germination.

Moderate membrane oxidation may stimulate ion channels promoting membrane transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Although experimental evidence for membrane lipid oxidation was not provided in this study, our data clearly indicated that plasma triggered membrane depolarization and elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.

AO090003000685 is a transcription factor, AtfA, which enhances spore germination by regulating the expression of genes involved in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> germination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. MpkA (yeast Slt2-like MAP kinase) activated by plasma may increase the expression of these genes.</p><p id="Par24">In conclusion, poor and unstable culture growth following isolation is a technical barrier to the efficient application of fungi to fermentation. Our study demonstrates that non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma could be used to overcome this barrier. Plasma enhances fungal spore germination, which is the first, crucial step in fungal colonization, by activating spore swelling and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Although further studies on the effects of plasma and their underlying mechanisms are still needed, our findings demonstrate that plasma could facilitate the high-density fungal colonization required for efficient fermentation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Fungal strains and culture conditions</title><p id="Par25">The <italic>A</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> (KACC47488) strain used in this study was obtained from the Korean Agriculture Type Collection in the National Agrobiodiversity Center (Republic of Korea) and maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (MB cell, Los Angeles, CA, USA) at 30 °C in the dark.
