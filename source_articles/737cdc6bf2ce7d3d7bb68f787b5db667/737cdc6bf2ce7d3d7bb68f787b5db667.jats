Two clinical samples from poultry obtained in 2016 yielded five different subtypes (highly pathogenic [HP] H5N1, HP H5N2, HP H7N1, HP H7N2, H9N2) and eight genotypes of AIV by plaque purification. H5 sequences grouped with clade 2.3.2.1a viruses while N1 was related to an older, preceding clade, 2.2.2. The internal genome segments of the plaque-purified viruses originated from clade 2.2.2 of H5N1 or from G1/H9N2 viruses. H9 and N2 segments clustered with contemporary H9N2 strains. In addition, HP H7 sequences were detected for the first time in samples and linked to Pakistani HP H7N3 viruses of 2003. The unexpected findings of mixtures of reassorted HP H5N1 and G1-like H9N2 viruses, which carry genome segments of older clades in association with the detection of HP H7 HA segments calls for confirmation of these results by targeted surveillance in the area of origin of the investigated samples. Hidden niches and obscured transmission pathways may exist that retain or re-introduce genome segments of older viruses or reassortants thereof which causes additional challenges for diagnosis, risk assessment and disease control.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung (Alexander von Humboldt

AIVs group into 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes each revealing various lineages and host-specific adaptations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Based on the pathogenic potential in experimentally infected chickens, phenotypes of low and high pathogenicity are distinguished (LP/HPAIV). Several AIV subtypes and lineages exhibiting explicit zoonotic propensity have emerged as a public health threat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, these are goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage derived HPAI H5 viruses and 2013-origin Chinese LPAI H7N9 viruses, but also further viruses such as the G1 lineage of subtype H9N2 have caused sporadic human cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Within the last decade, gs/GD HPAI H5 and LPAI H9N2 viruses have become endemic in poultry in several Asian and African countries causing huge economic losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Domestic duck populations play an important role in establishing and maintaining endemicity as they often subclinically shed and spread these viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Long term co-circulation of multiple influenza virus lineages in different species of poultry and inconsequent control attempts including fragmentary vaccination coverage has facilitated diversifying evolution by genetic drift and reassortment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Bangladesh, a south Asian country with a high density of poultry and human populations is no exception in this respect. Potentially zoonotic HPAI H5N1 and H9N2 viruses co-circulate endemically in commercial and backyard poultry shuttling between different poultry species and causing sporadic spill-overs into wild bird populations since early 2007<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Several reassortants between HPAI H5N1, H9N2 and HPAI H7N3 viruses have been recorded in the country although some reassortments took place before incursion into Bangladesh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, Bangladesh suffered from successive incursions and replacements of three different gs/GD HPAIV H5N1 clades, 2.2.2, 2.3.2.1, and 2.3.4.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Since 2012, clade 2.3.2.1a viruses have replaced previously co-circulating gs/GD viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Exposure of humans to these viruses is emphasized by nine and three cases of human infection with HPAIV H5N1 (including one death) and H9N2, respectively, till to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Here we illustrate the intricate epidemiological situation and the evolutionary potential of co-circulating AIV subtypes of different sub-, geno- and phenotypes by molecular analyses of clinically overt AI outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry in Tangail district, one of the most crowded districts for both poultry and human populations at the northern perimeter of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical and pathological observation</title><p id="Par5">Limited HPAI syndrome surveillance was carried out in Tangail district throughout January to May 2016 in commercial medium size layer chicken farms (so-called sector 3 according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO]) reporting respiratory illness. Carcasses of four chickens (VP02-VP05) were sampled at four different farms keeping grower and layer chickens 6 to 84 weeks old, cage-reared and putatively vaccinated against H5 viruses (unknown source). From neighboring backyard poultry holding the carcass of a duck (VP06) was collected as well. The sampled sector 3 chicken layer farms, each of up to 2000 birds reported morbidity of up to 90% dominated by respiratory disease and reduced egg production. Cumulative mortality approaching 35% at these farms was substantial but still low compared to previously recorded HPAI outbreaks in chickens in Bangladesh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Clinical presentation and epidemiological considerations thus raised the suspicion of AIV H9N2 infections. This suspicion was corroborated by contemporary, laboratory-confirmed findings of H9N2 cases with similar clinical presentation in the same area (unpublished). This prompted submission of samples directly to FVS-BAU while samples from HPAI suspect cases are to be filed to the National Reference Laboratory at Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute. At necropsy, however, at FVS-BAU, severe congestion in lung and trachea along with severely congested blood vessels at intestinal walls, petechial to ecchymotic haemorrhages at the epicardium, air sacs, intestine, proventricular glands and pancreas dominated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–d</xref>). Histopathologically, widespread haemorrhages, congestion and massive edema in lungs, mild cardiac myo-degeneration, hemorrhages in the lamina propria of intestine and necrosis of pancreatic islets were recorded (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e–h</xref>) and evoked the impression of a systemic infection.

However, mortality in the commercial layer chicken farm of C1/2016 was higher (70–75%). In this farm, in contrast to the flocks in Tangail district, an HPAIV H5N1 mono-infection was diagnosed.

The same samples were previously diagnosed based on RT-PCR and direct Sanger sequencing of clinical material, to be due to infection with reassorted H9N2 viruses. Despite presence of gene segments of several sub- and genotypes in the same sample, the corresponding sequence chromatograms showed a high quality; this is probably due to the high subtype specificity of primers used for cycle sequencing which grossly favored a single subtype over the rest. H5N1, H5N2 and H9N2 viruses were purified from ck/VP02 whereas H5N1, H5N2, H7N1 and H7N2 subtypes were purified from dk/VP06. Since plaque purification could not be carried out directly from clinical material, the five subtypes and eight different genotypes may not have been present in this constellation in the clinical samples. Some of the sub- and genotypes detected following plaque purification could have been generated during virus isolation in ECE and/or plaque-passaging. Surprisingly, no replicating H9N2 virus was rescued during plaque purification from dk/VP06 although RITA confirmed the presence of this subtype in this sample as well (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We speculate that this might have been due to the interference of the different viruses in this sample, and a higher replication efficiency of the numerous H5 and H7 viruses which might have outcompeted the H9 virus in our cloning approach.</p><p id="Par16">In depth molecular analyses revealed that the rescued H5N1 and H5N2 viruses derived their HA H5 segment from clade 2.3.2.1a viruses of the years 2012–2014 (HA, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, H5), while the N1 segment along with six internal genes most likely originated from clade 2.2.2/H5N1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, N1). However, the H5N1 viruses of this clade became apparently extinct from Bangladesh after 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Continued circulation of genome segments of that clade therefore was unexpected and currently stands as a solitary but important finding. As such, the possibility of undetected circulating clade 2.2.2 HPAI viruses or gene segments thereof in other reassortant subtypes must be considered. Chicken and duck samples (C1/2016 and D1/2016) obtained in the Mymensingh district in late 2016 and treated similarly in our labs proved to contain each a single AIV strain which carried contemporary 2.3.2.1a HA and NA genome segments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, H5).</p><p id="Par17">Even more surprising was the finding of an HPAI H7 virus having an HA gene similar to that of HPAI Pak/H7N3 viruses that had caused outbreaks in Pakistan during 2000–2003<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, but which had not been detected at that or any time in Bangladesh. Although subtype H7 viruses have been detected in backyard and free ranging ducks in Bangladesh, they were of low pathogenicity and their HA segment was of a Eurasian wild bird lineage unrelated to the HP H7 Pakistan viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, H7).</p><p id="Par18">A generic explanation for the detection of genome segments of older HP H5 and HP H7 strains in these samples would be by contamination in the laboratory. However, this can be rejected as a single diagnostic laboratory in Bangladesh (FVS-BAU) undertook all sample manipulations including virus isolation and this laboratory did never have access to replication-competent HP Pak/H7 and Bangladeshi HP H5N1 viruses of clade 2.2.2. Likewise, none of these viruses were available in the laboratory at FLI where subsequent RITA assays, virus amplification and plaque purification experiments were carried out. Unfortunately, original tissues of these cases were no longer retrievable for confirmation. Thus, the true sources of the HP H7 and HP H5 2.2.2 viruses remain elusive.</p><p id="Par19">HA and NA segments of purified H9N2 clones were similar to circulating contemporary G1/H9N2 viruses although their internal genes originated from clade 2.2.2/H5N1. Previously, it was also reported that Bangladeshi H9N2 viruses shared internal genes with HP H5N1 (PB1, clade 2.3.2.1a) and with the HP Pak/H7N3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These findings at least indicate independent of our findings that there must have been opportunities of reassortment between HP H5N1 and the Pakistani H7 viruses although it remained unclear where and when such events took place. In turn, our findings could provide a very comprehensible explanation for those observations. Also in Cambodia, extensive co-circulation of and reassortment among H5, H7 and H9 AIV in poultry has recently been pointed out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">The potential of sustained replication in ECE of G1/H9N2 viruses even in competition with HPAI H5 and H7 viruses was demonstrated during a limited number of passages in co-infected ECE. Although no prognosis for the next 10 or 50 passages can be made, it seems conceivable that sets of different AIV sub- and genotypes may be co-transmitted across at least several passages also <italic>in vivo</italic>. Yet, it is not possible to extrapolate these results to the field where additional transmission bottlenecks may exist. Stable replication in chickens of an LPAI H7N7 virus even in presence of its HP mutant descendant virus has recently been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">From a diagnostic perspective, the presence of minor viral populations within extended mixtures as described here would only be detected by using highly sensitive and multiple subtype-discerning diagnostic tools such as RITA. In contrast, more global diagnostic approaches including direct Sanger sequencing based on universal “Hoffmann” primers and strain-specific sequencing primers might yield incomplete and even false conclusions depending on the specificity of the primers. This was initially the case here, when different reassorted H9N2 viruses were diagnosed on basis of full-length genome Sanger sequencing. In addition, also high throughput sequencing approaches might give more insights for those samples in the future.</p><p id="Par22">Presence of HPAIV phenotypes in G1/H9N2 mixtures would be expected to influence pathogenesis and clinical picture. This was evident also here with the detection of signs of systemic infection and lesions in multiple organs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), but comparatively low cumulative mortality in affected flocks. Viral population size within those mixture and, hence, clinical sequelae, would vary according to the specific immune status of the hosts. In the reported cases, the affected layer chickens probably had received H5-specific vaccination. Recently, chickens and ducks sold in live bird market in Bangladesh were found positive for HPAIV H5N1 but appeared apparently healthy when sampled although the vaccination status of those birds was unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Potential masking of HPAIV related clinical signs in vaccinated or LPAIV co-infected poultry should be considered when analyzing spread of HPAIV along trading networks.</p><p id="Par23">The much unexpected findings of mixtures of reassorted HP H5N1 and G1-like H9N2 viruses which carry genome segments of older gs/GD clades and the detection of HP H7 HA segments previously not reported from Bangladesh, calls for confirmation of these results by targeted surveillance in the area of origin of the investigated samples. Virus strains or reassorted gene segments thereof believed to be extinct may yet still reside in small regional pockets or populations. In general, our findings emphasize the need of a broader and deeper analysis of (AI) viral populations in clinical samples and corresponding viral isolates originating from AI outbreaks. While next-generation sequencing techniques provide ultimate tools for this approach, available multiplexed or arrayed RT-qPCR applications allow for a rapid screening at more sensible costs and of higher sample numbers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample origin, pathology and virus propagation</title><p id="Par24">Necropsy, histopathology and virological investigations as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> were carried out upon arrival of poultry carcasses at the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Bangladesh Agricultural University (FVS-BAU).
