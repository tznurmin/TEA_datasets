For this purpose, in vitro models that maintain the functional and compositional profiles of in vivo gut microbiomes would be extremely valuable. Here, we present a 96-deep well plate-based culturing model (MiPro) that maintains the functional and compositional profiles of individual gut microbiomes, as assessed by metaproteomics, while allowing a four-fold increase in viable bacteria counts. Comparison of taxon-specific functions between pre- and post-culture microbiomes shows a Pearson’s correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> of 0.83 ± 0.03. In addition, we show a high degree of correlation between gut microbiome responses to metformin in the MiPro model and those in mice fed a high-fat diet.

id="Par3">The gut microbiota is being increasingly recognized as a key factor in human health and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, and as such, it is an important target for drug therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Evidence is mounting that microbial metabolism of drugs can directly affect drug efficacy and toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and that drugs can, in turn, alter the composition and function of the gut microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, potentially affecting the health of the host. Therefore, the gut microbial ecosystem, specific microbes, and microbial pathways are novel targets in drug discovery.</p><p id="Par4">In vitro culture models could be a timely and cost-efficient way to discover microbiome responses to drugs. However, current culture models do not maintain the functional and compositional profiles of the gut microbiome. To simulate an in vivo microbial ecosystem, it is key to conserve both the composition and functional activities of an individual’s microbiome. In current in vitro culturing methods, profound shifts in taxa proportions have been frequently described during both batch culturing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and continuous flow culturing models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> when compared to the inoculum. Importantly, shifts in microbiome composition can alter their functional properties and ecological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, which could affect microbial responses to drug stimuli. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported models that maintain microbiome properties similar to the inoculum. In particular, the preservation of functional activities has not been described elsewhere. Moreover, a high percentage of marketed drugs, and compounds in development, may have off-target effects on the gut microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Maier et al. observed that non-antibiotic drugs had extensive antibiotic-like impacts on cultured human gut bacterial strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, the response of isolated strains may differ from that of a functionally preserved gut microbiome due to the complex functionality of a microbial community. Therefore, systematic studies of drug effects using functionally maintained individual gut microbiomes, as the in vitro model, is a pressing need. For long-term observations of xenobiotic effects, continuous flow systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and microfluidic models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> work well. However, these models can not be readily adapted for high-throughput approaches, partially due to their sizes and the time required for setting up and stabilizing these bioreactors.</p><p id="Par5">Gut microbes can respond to altered environmental factors within a single day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To gain a deep insight into a microbiome’s responses to drugs, a technique that can precisely quantify microbial functional activities is required. Metaproteomics is a meta-omic tool that directly quantifies the microbial functional responses at the end-product level of expressed proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The development and application of mass spectrometry (MS)-based metaproteomic technologies in gut microbiome research has thrived in recent years. The identification coverage and sensitivity of MS-based metaproteomics have increased dramatically, enabling in-depth analysis of microbiome functional activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. An advantage of metaproteomics when compared to sequencing-based techniques is that it can combine functional and phylogenic information. Metaproteomics is also more accurate for biomass estimates on a species level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and it enables the study of taxon-specific functions through annotation of unique peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Comparison of taxon-specific functional profiles of the microbiome is important for determining cultured stability and drug responses. This is because overall functions can remain relatively stable due to the redundancy of functional genes among species in a gut microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. As well, genes predicted from metagenomic analyses are not necessarily expressed. Therefore, metaproteomics is a suitable tool for insights into in vitro drug responses of gut microbiome.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we report the development and validation of a scalable in vitro model for the maintenance of gut microbiome profiles (MiPro). Briefly, the MiPro model adopted an optimized culture medium and a 96-deep well plate-based format for microbiome culture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The culture medium and culturing conditions were improved from our previous medium composition study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The model was first evaluated for its ability to maintain gut microbiome profiles in vitro, followed by testing and evaluation of the model’s in vitro correlation with in vivo drug response. This culture model enabled, in combination with metaproteomic analysis, the assessment of drug effects on the microbiome at compositional and functional levels. This model maintained high microbiome compositional stability and greater than 0.83 taxon-function similarity (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>) over 24 h. In addition, we demonstrated that our MiPro model recapitulated the in vivo effects of metformin observed on individual mouse gut microbiomes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Establishment and general performance of the MiPro model. <bold>a</bold> Main components of the MiPro model: microbiome samples are cultured in an optimized culture medium in a 96-deep well plate.

We have recently evaluated the composition of the culture medium for optimal culturing of ex vivo microbiomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Here, we improved upon the composition of our previously reported medium by assessing the effect of bile salts formulae on the gut microbiome. Two formulae were compared: (1) a mixture of primary bile salts, i.e. 1:1 (w/w) sodium salt forms of cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and (2) a commercial 1:1 (w/w) mixture of sodium salt forms of CA and deoxycholic acid (DCA). The commercial bile salts mixture has been adopted by a majority of studies employing gut microbiome culture media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We compared the maintenance of taxon-specific functional profiles for gut microbiota cultured in the presence of either formulae (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Briefly, gut microbiota cultured for 24 h were subjected to metaproteomic analysis, and a taxon-function-coupled analysis was carried out using the iMetaLab platform (<ext-link xlink:href="http://shiny.imetalab.ca/" ext-link-type="url">http://shiny.imetalab.ca/</ext-link>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). We observed significant increase of Pearson’s correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> of taxon-specific functional profiles between the inocula (0 h baseline sample) and the cultured microbiome in the presence of the primary bile salts mixture (CDCA + CA). Moreover, comparison of microbiome composition (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2a, b</xref>) and the abundances of clusters of orthologous group (COG) categories (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2C</xref>) also suggested that the presence of CDCA + CA could maintain the microbiome better than DCA + CA.</p><p id="Par8">Additionally, we assessed whether the gut microbiome culture was affected by the culturing conditions, namely (1) tube-based and (2) 96-deep well based culturing, while keeping all other conditions, including medium, inoculum, temperature, and container material (polypropylene) constant. Culture tubes are the most frequently used containers in batch culture experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Notably, the 96-deep well was covered with a silicone-gel cover, which was perforated at the top of each well. This cover could impair gas-exchange with the outer environment in the chamber, so as to preserve the partial pressure of gases and volatile metabolites in each well, which could subsequently preserve certain levels of dissolved gas molecules in the culture medium. In contrast to the use of 96-deep well plates, employing culture tubes resulted in a remarkable change in the taxon-specific functional activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) as well as other taxonomic and functional profiles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). From the above results, we established our MiPro model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>): a 96-deep well plate-based culturing in combination with the optimized medium which contains 1:1 (w/w) of CA and CDCA (hereafter called MiPro medium).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>MiPro increased viable bacteria and quintupled the count</title><p id="Par9">We next evaluated the ability of the MiPro model to sustain a viable microbiome, which is vital for an effective in vitro microbiome response study. Temporal changes in parameters including microbial biomass, cell count, viability and diversity were compared with the 0 h baseline sample. The commonly used basal culture medium (BCM) was included for comparison. Since different microbial members can differ by several orders of magnitude in biomass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, it is necessary to examine both biomass and bacterial counts. We used optical density at 595 nm (OD<sub>595</sub>) to determine bacterial biomass density, and used flow cytometry to determine bacterial cell counts.

While taxonomic profiling is important to characterize an individual’s microbiome, biological processes and functions cannot be assessed by compositional analyses. Yet, such information is essential for gaining deeper understanding of the microbiota’s behavior and functional activities and ultimately for designing microbiome-targeted manipulations. The need for functional understanding is even more crucial given that the microbiome’s functions can be altered in absence of compositional changes. For example, sialylated milk oligosaccharides elicit a microbiota-dependent growth in mice, which are used as models of infant undernutrition by inducing the production of microbial metabolites, yet without any significant change in the relative abundance of most microbes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

DCA (secondary bile acid) is known to act as an antimicrobial agent due to its high-hydrophobic and detergent effects on bacterial membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Studies have noted a decrease in Firmicutes abundance in response to DCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Hence, we replaced DCA with CDCA, a major primary bile acid produced in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. This replacement was effective in maintaining the in vitro microbiome composition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). We used a silicone-gel cover perforated at the top of each to permit the escape of the gas produced by the gut microbiota while minimizing inward gas diffusion from the anaerobic chamber. We found that using culture tubes with loose caps resulted in marked microbiome composition changes, while the 96-well format maintained the microbiome composition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). One possible explanation could be that the silicon-gel cover may have increased the partial pressure of gases produced by the gut microbiome, such as H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and volatile organic compounds, such as SCFAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.

Some dissolved metabolites are important factors for bacteria cross-feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and the control of pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, and thus, are presumably essential for the maintenance of an in vitro microbiome. Other factors may include differences in the surface area to volume ratio, agitation mechanics from cultures in differently-shaped vessels. Our model was developed for rapidly screening drugs against different individual’s gut microbiomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.

By incorporating the medium into gut-on-a-chip systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> or similar models, we may be able to study organ site-specific effects. Furthermore, our model could also be used with stable isotopes labeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> for probing metabolic activity in individual microbiomes.</p><p id="Par19">After our optimizations, our MiPro model quintupled viable bacteria count, and had alpha-diversity and microbial composition at 24 h post-inoculation that were similar to the inoculum at time 0. These findings are in agreement with the premise that high biodiversity may enhance the temporal stability of microbial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. In terms of functions, a general view of functional stability using summed protein abundances in each functional category is not sufficient due to the complexity of functional constitution in a gut microbiome ecosystem. At the microbiome level, functional pathways are stable within healthy human populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. This stability is due to functional redundancy among species in a gut microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Indeed, functional compensation can happen among different taxa, which preserves long-term average ecosystem performance, as one species can increase in function to balance for loss or decline in that function by another species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. This mechanism shifts the functional balance between two taxa in a gut ecosystem. Therefore, for maintenance of an in vitro gut microbiome culturing system, it is very important to preserve the stability of taxon-specific functional profiles in the microbiome. And results showed that this has been well achieved in our model. Together, our MiPro model comprises two phases: a growth phase with significant viable biomass accumulation and a lag phase where &gt;83% of the taxon-specific functional activities of the inoculum were maintained. Hence, this model can be effectively used to amplify a microbial community and to investigate the effect of perturbations on the microbial community composition and functional activities. As stated previously, the gut microbiome can respond to changes in its environment within a day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Hence, for processes such as high-throughput drug screening, a 24 h culture using the Mipro model would be applicable.

Therefore, future work will explore whether the formation of secondary and tertiary bile acids during culturing affects the microbiome.

To identify the ideal physical culturing conditions, samples were cultured either in 1 ml of media in 96-deep well plates or in 2 ml of media in culturing tubes (cat#T406-2A, Simport, Canada). The 96-deep well plate was covered with a silicone gel mat with a vent hole on each well made by a sterile syringe needle.

All participants signed informed consent to participate in the study. Briefly, ~ 3 g of fresh stool sample was collected from each individual using a 2.5 ml sterile sampling spoon (Bel-Art, United States). The spoon was dropped into a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 15 ml of sterile PBS pre-reduced with 0.1% (w/v) L-cysteine hydrochloride. The samples were immediately transferred into an anaerobic workstation (5% H<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 90% N<sub>2</sub> at 37 °C). Before homogenization with a vortex mixer, the tube was uncapped for a few seconds to enable gas exchange and in particular oxygen removal. Sample homogenates were filtered using sterile gauzes and were immediately inoculated into each medium for static culturing at a final inoculum concentration of 2% (w/v). Culturing of an individual’s microbiome was carried out in 1 ml MiPro medium. The conventional basal culture medium (BCM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> was also included for evaluating the performance of our improved medium.
