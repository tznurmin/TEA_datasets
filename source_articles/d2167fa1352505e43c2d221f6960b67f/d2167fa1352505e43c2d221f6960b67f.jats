In a previous study, we reported on the transcriptional response of <italic>R. solani</italic> AG1-IB (isolate 7/3/14) during the interspecies interaction with <italic>L. sativa</italic> cv. Tizian by means of RNA sequencing. Here we present the <italic>L. sativa</italic> transcriptome and metabolome from the same experimental approach. Three distinct interaction zones were sampled and compared to a blank (non-inoculated) sample: symptomless zone 1, zone 2 showing light brown discoloration, and a dark brown zone 3 characterized by necrotic lesions. Throughout the interaction, we observed a massive reprogramming of the <italic>L. sativa</italic> transcriptome, with 9231 unique genes matching the threshold criteria for differential expression. The lettuce transcriptome of the light brown zone 2 presents the most dissimilar profile compared to the uninoculated zone 4, marking the main stage of interaction. Transcripts putatively encoding several essential proteins that are involved in maintaining jasmonic acid and auxin homeostasis were found to be negatively regulated. These and other indicator transcripts mark a potentially inadequate defence response, leading to a compatible interaction. KEGG pathway mapping and GC-MS metabolome data revealed large changes in amino acid, lignin and hemicellulose related pathways and related metabolites.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministery of inovation North Rhine- Westphalia CLIB</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_43706.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The leafy green vegetable lettuce (<italic>Lactuca sativa</italic>, L.), member of the family <italic>Asteraceae</italic>, is popular around the world for food and feed purposes. Unfortunately, lettuce is sensitive to a wide range of bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens. The necrotrophic soil-borne pathogen <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> AG1-IB is best known for bottom rot disease on lettuce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The inherent plant defence mechanism reactions are specific for pathogens with different lifestyles like necrotrophs, biotrophs and hemibiotrophs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Obligate biotrophic pathogens (e.g., <italic>Puccinia</italic> spp., <italic>Blumeria</italic> spp.) have coevolved mechanisms to maintain host viability, use nutrients from living cells and generally lack toxin production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Hemibiotrophic pathogens such as <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> are characterized by their capability to switch from a biotrophic lifestyle to a necrotrophic lifestyle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast to biotrophs, necrotrophs exclusively extract nutrients from dead cells and have evolved aggressive and extensive virulence strategies that promote host cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Necrotrophs include host-specific like <italic>Cochliobolus carbonum</italic> and broad host-range species such as <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic>, and <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The soil-borne pathogen <italic>R. solani</italic> is generally considered to be a simple necrotrophic broad-host-range pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Regardless of the pathogens lifestyle, the activation of plant defence responses involves complex events on cellular, histological and molecular levels. The response of plants against pathogens generally operates at two levels. The first level is induced in plants when microbe associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) or damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) which trigger a broad-spectrum defence response known as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). The second level, the effector-triggered immune response (ETI), is induced through recognition of pathogen specific avirulence effectors by host-disease resistance proteins that result in rapid and robust response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The ETI response is based on the principle of gene-for-gene resistance. Against necrotrophic fungal pathogens, this mode of defence is rather rare in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and not known for <italic>R. solani</italic> interaction in any host plant to date. Plant defence responses to necrotophs are very complex and reflect the multiplicity of virulence mechanisms of necrotrophs targeting diverse cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. As already mentioned, infections of necrotrophic pathogens result in host cell death. To induce host cell necrosis and leakage of nutrients, necrotrophs can secrete phytotoxic secondary metabolites and peptides, cell wall-degrading enzymes and produce reactive oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Plant host cell death in turn is associated for instance with production of antimicrobial peptides and hormones such as salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET), and jasmonic acid (JA), accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or modification of cell wall components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The role of host cell death differs between plants responding to biotrophic or necrotrophic pathogens. Cell death (hypersensitive response) induced at the site of infection by biotrophs is an indicator of resistance, whereas host cell death induced by necrotrophs is an indicator for successful infection. Therefore, based on the pathogen’s lifestyle, different responses are required from the plant to launch an effective defence. The response against biotrophs mostly relies on SA, whereas the response against necrotrophs predominantly depends on JA and ET regulated pathways. However, nowadays it is known that separation between these mechanisms is not the schism that it was formerly presumed to be. Several studies have pointed at the existence of interplay between these mechanisms of plant defence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In addition, it has been suggested that several necrotrophic pathogens are capable of tricking the plant defence system by activating the response towards biotrophs, resulting in host cell death and thus promoting a successful interaction of the necrotrophic pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Little is known on the plant’s control of disease-associated cell death especially as a response to interaction with a broad host-range necrotrophic pathogen such as <italic>R. solani</italic>. Besides lettuce, the necrotrophic pathogen <italic>R. solani</italic> AG1-IB affects many more host plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. First insights into the <italic>R. solani</italic> AG1-IB transcriptome during interaction with lettuce in a leaf infection model showed high expression of <italic>R. solani</italic> agglutinin genes as well as genes associated with apoptosis. Moreover, 21 genes of unknown function were specifically expressed in the initial phase of interaction, symptomless zone 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that the early phase of <italic>R. solani</italic> AG1-IB interaction is associated with mechanisms leading to host cell death. However, little is known about the biochemical mechanisms specifying this pathosystem. To elucidate the various interactions involved, we previously reported on the genome sequence of lettuce cv. Tizian and <italic>R. solani</italic> AG1-IB (isolate 7/3/14), addressing the genomic potential and transcriptional activity of both partners in the course of their interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. <italic>R. solani</italic> harbours various genes putatively specifying functions that can be linked to pathogenicity like: MAP kinases, GABA metabolism, melanin synthesis, plant cell wall degradation and interference with plant cell defences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Concerning the lettuce cv. Tizian genome, we previously identified a high number of genes associated with plant defences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, substantial research efforts have been conducted for the lettuce cv. Salinas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Previously, the structure of the major resistance cluster and the identification of pathogen-recognizing receptors were reported for this cultivar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. First insights into the response of lettuce towards the necrotrophic fungus <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> uncovered upregulation of the phenylpropanoid and terpenoid synthesis pathways as well as a global downregulation of photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">To date our understanding of plant defence mechanisms, especially against attack by necrotrophic pathogens such as <italic>R. solani,</italic> is limited and more knowledge of the plant defence against these pathogens is needed for future control strategies. After the detailed analysis of the <italic>R. solani</italic> AG1-IB transcriptome during interaction with lettuce in a previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

Additionally, a set of 45 transcripts related to auxin-activated signalling (GO:0009734) is down-regulated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>WRKY transcription factors</title><p id="Par34">Further regulatory elements with highly specific induction between the interaction zones are the WRKY transcription factor family members. With fold-changes of up to 60, it can be assumed that these are of great importance during the lettuce/<italic>R. solani</italic> interaction. WRKYs play essential roles in plants including biotic and abiotic defences, development and senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Although WRKYs have been studied for many plant species, only little information is available for lettuce WRKYs. Apart from activation of plant defences, <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> WRKY1 and WRKY2 homologs for example are involved in regulation of PTI and ETI responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, whereas two close homologs of rice WRKY45 either regulate SA or JA levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Future research on lettuce WRKYs should elucidate their function in pathogen interactions and hormone homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Metabolite profiles are distinctive for each interaction zone</title><p id="Par35">Regarding the metabolite analysis, we should mention that in contrast to the previously discussed transcriptome analysis, most metabolites cannot be attributed to one of the two interaction partners definitively. Combining the knowledge gained from the transcriptomes and comparison with the blank and in relation to the level of interaction, these profiles can be interpreted.</p><p id="Par36">One of the most interesting compounds identified in the metabolite analysis is the non-metabolizable sucrose-analog turanose. It is involved in signal transduction and priming of defence in <italic>Lycopersicon peruvianum</italic> (tomato), <italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize) and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (rice)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Several studies report on a reduction of the turanose content after plant infection with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solani</italic>, most likely because fungi unlike plants are capable to metabolize turanose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. In contrast, co-inoculation with <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> resulted in a turanose concentration comparable to the control samples and it was suggested that this adjustment is mechanistic in plant priming. We propose a slightly modified hypothesis where not the absolute concentration but the change in concentration of turanose is able to prime plant defence. Further compounds with reduced concentrations during interaction comprised the amino acids tyrosine, methionine, threonine, isoleucine, valine, serine, proline, phenylalanine, 4-aminobutyrat and leucine. The decrease of these compounds indicates their importance during the defence. KEGG pathway mapping of the transcriptome data indicated clear up-regulation within the KEGG pathways for phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, leucine and isoleucine synthesis. In addition, the degradation of cysteine, methionine, valine, leucine, isoleucine and sphingolipid and the synthesis of phenylpropanoid also appeared to be up-regulated which may result in a decrease of the aforementioned compounds despite the up-regulation of the corresponding synthesis pathways. Subsequently, several intermediates of the phenylpropanoid pathway decreased in concentration in interaction zone 2. Integrating this information and the transcriptome mapping onto the phenylpropanoid pathway suggests a flux directed towards the production of synapaldehyde and synapoyl-CoA representing precursors of lignin. Malate, citric acid, glucose and fructose fuel the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways and satisfy the increased energy demand. In addition, glucose probably is utilized for cellulose synthesis. Glucuronic acid and xylose show a small peak in concentration within interaction zone 1. These are both possible components of hemicellulose and S-methylcysteine; the latter is a possible precursor for alexine synthesis. Both compounds are increased in concentration in zone 2, Arabinose and xylitol are most likely degradation products of <italic>R. solani</italic> induced cell wall lysis. Alternatively, it is possible that downstream synthesis of hemi-cellulose is restrained, causing the accumulation of precursors components. Threonic acid and tartaric acid, decomposition products of ascorbate, increase in concentrations within zone 2. Although ascorbate concentrations were not directly measured, it can be assumed, based on transcriptome data and the above mentioned results, that the ascorbate concentration is reduced, a status that has been linked to induction of senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. Furthermore, vitamin C is an important anti-oxidative protecting agent against ROS and tartaric acid cannot be metabolised by fungi.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p id="Par37">In this study, we have demonstrated that inoculation of lettuce cv. Tizian with <italic>R. solani</italic> AG1-IB causes large-scale reprogramming of the transcriptome and metabolome in lettuce leaf tissue. Our data suggest that the role of lettuce in the interaction is not as passive as was previously assumed. Analysis of the metabolite profiles and the differentiated patterns of PRG transcript levels between the three interaction zones very much corroborates active defence efforts of lettuce. The defence reaction of lettuce has more in common with a guarded retreat, where spread of the fungus is minimized or retarded, instead of an offensive defence approach. In the introduction, we postulated that an SA mediated early response can be beneficial during the initial phase of interaction. Eventually, though, during the infective phase of interaction <italic>R. solani</italic> is a necrotrophic pathogen and JA mediated defences should be dominant. Therefore, the consistent down-regulation of JAR1 and several auxin responsive genes was very surprising, as was the lack of enrichment for SA responsive genes. The apparent improper regulation of JA and SA signalling, adapted to the specific interaction zones, appears to be a clear disadvantage and might weaken the effectiveness of the lettuce local defence response. Alternatively, <italic>R. solani</italic> may actively interfere with host hormonal signalling, deregulating the defence response. In the future, more research is needed to confirm these findings, including experimental work with whole plant interaction models. As such, future work should address identification of elicitors responsible for inducing lettuce PCD/senescence within this pathosystem. Furthermore, hormone levels should be measured directly to analyse their influence and correlation with the transcription profiles that were described here and lettuce PRG and WRKY candidate gene functions have to be elucidated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The bioinformatics support of the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI) is gratefully acknowledged.
