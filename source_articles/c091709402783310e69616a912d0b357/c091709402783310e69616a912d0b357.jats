Insects and pests increase the risks of spoilage of crops. They are the real threat to the agriculture fields as well as the post-harvesting grain crops. Damage caused by the insects affects the quality, the quantity and the commercial value of the products (Tagizadeh and Mohammadkhani, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017</xref>). Worldwide losses in stored grains caused by insects have been estimated to be between 5 and 10% in temperate and 20-30% in tropics (Berhanu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>). Post-harvesting grain crops are exposed to many insect pests. Post-harvest losses could be of quantitative or qualitative nature and can generally be reflected in several ways such as weight loss, nutritional, and monetary loss (FAO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1983</xref>). Most of the grains are usually stored on farm or in large commercial grain elevator. Wheat crop is under threat of many environmental stresses, diseases, and insect pests which causes significant yield loses (Muhammad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>). Two major groups of insects such as Coleoptera (beetles) and Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) comprises the most economically important post-harvest insect pests. The ruining of the grains by the beetles will seriously affect the germination ability and virtue of the product. The infestation by the beetle is mainly due to improper sanitation. Insects are controlled principally by the use of insecticides, but several commonly used chemicals are no longer recommended for use on stored grains because of their potential health hazards to humans; hence, there is a need for safer and effective methods of insect control.</p><p id="Par15">Among the various beetles, <italic>Tribolium casteneum</italic> Herbst is the major beetle which infests the stored products. <italic>Tribolium casteneum</italic> is commonly called red flour beetle. It is a gregarious insect of cereal grains and other products. This insect causes a substantial loss in storage because of its high-reproductive potential (Prakash et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1987</xref>). So the controlling of this beetle is necessary to prevent economic loss. To control these beetles, various fumigants and other synthetic insecticides are widely used. Currently, malathion has been used comprehensively for controlling red flour beetle, but now, it is not so effective against this pest due to the insect resistance (Horton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1984</xref>). Malathion is less toxic to the mammals whereas the pesticide causes negative effects even to the non-targeted organisms including humans (Parkin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1958</xref>). An alternative approach to the control of the <italic>Tribolium casteneum</italic> is necessary to prevent the infestation of the cereals and grains.</p><p id="Par16">Nanotechnology has revolutionized the world with tremendous advancements in many fields of science like engineering, biotechnology, analytical chemistry, and agriculture (Sahayaraj Kitherian, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>). Their use in crop protection is just in its infancy (Resham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>). Nanoparticles help to produce new pesticides, insecticides, and insect repellents. The use of nanomaterials in agriculture, especially for plant protection and production, is an underexplored research area. As the nanoparticles have a high-surface area to volume ratio, they can pass through the cell membranes of the insects and can harm them. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly used in various fields, including medical, food, health care, industrial purposes, and the agricultural fields. They are the nanoparticles of the silver of which the size ranges between 1 nm and 100 nm. The silver nanoparticle has many applications due to the large degree of commercialization. The potential of AgNPs has been widely utilized in nanomedicine, drug delivery, cosmetics, electronic application, and environmental protection (Murawala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>). The silver nanoparticles were fabricated using a chemical reduction method.</p><p id="Par17">As insects are resistant to the majority of the insecticide, it is necessary to find an alternative to control these insects which is a major threat to the agricultural crops. Nanotechnology plays an important role in the agricultural field. Silver nanoparticles have the efficacy to act against the insects (Abduz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>, Marwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>).

The color of the solution was due to the excitation of surface plasmon vibration in the silver nanoparticles. The UV-Vis spectroscopic observations indicate that colloidal solution of silver nanoparticles exhibit an intense absorption peak due to the surface plasmon around 422 nm which really indicates the formation of silver nanoparticles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles showed a strong absorbance peak at 428 nm. Similar kind of results was also observed (Thangapandiyan and Prema, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). The X-ray diffraction of silver nanoparticles is depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The intensive diffraction peak at 2<italic>θ</italic> value of 38.21° from the (111) lattice plane of face centred cubic (fcc) unequivocally indicates that the particles are made of pure silver. Three additional bands were observed at 44.49 °, 64.75 °, and 77.67 ° which correspond to the (200), (220), and (311) planes of silver (respectively). The Bragg’s peak position and their intensities were compared with standard JCPDS files. The result showed that the particles were spherical and cubic nature. The size of the silver nanoparticles was found to be 27 nm. The characteristic main diffraction peak at 2<italic>θ</italic> = 38.08° confirmed that the particle is made up of pure silver (Krishnakumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>). Van Dong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2012</xref> reported the X-ray diffraction of chemical mediated silver nanoparticles exhibit remarkably intensive diffraction peak at 2<italic>θ</italic> = 38.1°. The present findings are very much closer to the earliest reports. Scanning electron micrograph of synthesized silver nanoparticles revealed that the particle were more or less cubical and spherical in nature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The size of the silver nanoparticles fabricated by chemical reduction method is given in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The percent frequency distributions of the obtained silver nanoparticles are given in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The synthesized AgNPs showed individual particles as well as agglomerated particles. The agglomeration is due to the intermolecular interaction such as Van der Waals force. The similar kind of morphology of silver nanoparticle with some irregular particles was also reported (Basavaraj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>). Energy dispersive spectra of silver nanoparticles showed a strong signal at 3 keV in the silver region and this confirmed the presence of silver nanoparticles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The elemental analysis revealed that the silver was a major constituent, and it contains 79.1%.

The mortality rate of the <italic>T. castaneum</italic> increased gradually with an increase in the exposure period. On the ninth day of observation, the combination of the malathion and the silver nanoparticles shows 100% mortality at the highest concentration. The silver nanoparticles show 75% mortality at the concentration of 50 mg and the malathion shows 95% mortality. The LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> values of all the tested samples were illustrated in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. It is known that the increased concentration of the malathion can be hazardous to the human and the environment. So the mixing of the silver nanoparticles to the malathion can be effective in killing the insects as well as the lesser concentration of malathion can be used in the mixed suspension. The data were analyzed using chi-square test, and it is significant at 0.15 level.

The results revealed that the highest reduction in the oviposition was brought by the mixed suspension of the malathion and the silver nanoparticles (71.5%) followed by malathion (45.11%). The silver nanoparticle shows the 32.29% oviposition deterrency. The discrimination quotient (DQ) values represent ovipositional deterrency. The DQ values of the present study are 0.55, 0.17, and 0.29. Since the values are obtained in positive, it is presumed that all the samples were having promising oviposition deterrency. The DQ values indicated the efficiency of oviposition deterrence property (Messina Renwick and Renwick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1987</xref>). Hence, it has confirmed ovipositional deterrency. The egg production of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> was highly suppressed by nano diatomaceous (Sabbour and Shadia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>). The reduction in the egg-laying clearly indicates that the nanoparticles can control the population growth and the progeny. The declines in the oviposition at higher doses have been attributed to the interruption of vitellogenesis and damage to the egg chamber (Pandey and Khan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1998</xref>). Vanmathi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2010</xref> stated that the oviposition deterrency may be due to the changes induced in physiology and behavior of the insect.

The RGR and the RCR index are very much reduced at the concentration of 100 ppm of the mixed suspension of the malathion and the nanoparticles (0.02 mg/mg/day, 0.11 mg/mg/day, respectively). The synthesized silver nanoparticles at 50 ppm show the RGR and RCR values 0.31 mg/mg/day and 0.49 which is lower than the control. The RGR and RCR index of the malathion shows higher values when compared to the mixed suspension of AgNPs and malathion. The one-way ANOVA analysis of relative growth rate and relative consumption rate of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> were statistically significant at the different concentrations of tested samples (<italic>F</italic> = 11.35; <italic>P</italic> = 0.003, <italic>F</italic> = 11.479; <italic>P</italic> = 0.003). The reduction in these values clearly indicates that the food consumption by the <italic>T. castaneum</italic> is greatly reduced as it affects the growth rate of the adult insect. Similar to the RGR trend, the reduction rate of ECI % increased with the increasing sample concentration. The ECI % of the mixed suspension of AgNPs and malathion at the concentration of 100 ppm shows 22.3% which is the lowest ECI% when compared to the other tested samples. The reduction in the ECI% is due to the inability of conversion of the biomass ingested which clearly indicate that the combination of AgNPs have the antifeedant activity. The one-way ANOVA analysis of efficacy of conversion of ingested food <italic>T. castaneum</italic> revealed that it was statistically significant at the different concentrations of tested samples (<italic>F</italic> = 4.021; <italic>P</italic> = 0.05). The FDI values increased with increase in the concentration. The mixed suspension of AgNPs and malathion at the concentration of 100 ppm shows high FDI% (69.76%). The FDI% of synthesized silver nanoparticles at low concentration is 27.32%. The one-way ANOVA analysis of feeding deterrence Index of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> revealed that it was significantly increased at the different concentrations of tested samples (<italic>F</italic> = 29.756; <italic>P</italic> = 0.00). The reduction in the ECI and the increase in the FCI of the mixed suspension of AgNPs and the malathion has a considerable role in the post-ingestive toxicity. <italic>Euphorbia hirta</italic> mediated silver nanoparticles have the antifeedant activity against <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>. Decreased food utilization efficiency measures (ECI and ECD) and concomitant decreased in the level of digestive enzymes profiles in the midgut after the treatment indicate that nanoparticle administration affected gut physiology of insects (Durga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par41">The AgNPs can interfere with copper transport into cells. They are toxic to the insects because they create a deficiency of copper. The protein portion of the enzymes is produced normally, but they are less active because the copper is not incorporated into an enzyme active site, possibly due to copper availability (Armstrong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>). Management of stored grain pests stands traditionally on use of synthetic insecticides and long-term application of these chemicals develops resistance to pesticides. In recent years, nanotechnology has received much attention for controlling pathogens in agriculture (Eleka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). The obtained results clearly indicate that the silver nanoparticles can be used as the best alternative for the insect pest management. As the insects are being resistant to the various chemical insecticides, the mixing of nanoparticles can provide a better way to control the storage pests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">Agriculture is the backbone of most developing countries. The pests and beetles are the major threat to the field of agriculture and the post-harvesting grain crops, as they increase the risk of damages. They affect the quality as well as the quantity of the grains. <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> is the major beetle which infests the storage grains. Nanotechnology plays an important role in pest control management. In the present study, results on the bioassay including the mortality tests, antifeedent tests, ovipositional deterrency, and the repellent activity reveal that the malathion along with silver nanoparticles show highest pesticidal activity against <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. As the beetles improve their insecticide resistance to the commercial synthetic insecticide, the use of silver nanoparticles can be very effective against the beetles and the pests which is a major threat to the agricultural crops as well as the storage grains. In conclusion, the present findings clearly indicate that the silver nanoparticles possess the capabilities of being a good candidate in the search of an alternative for the damages caused by the beetles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>The authors greatly acknowledge the Department of Zoology, PSG College of Arts and Science for the facilities extended towards the research.</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Competing of interests</title><p id="Par43">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>ASAA performed the experiment and wrote the manuscript.
