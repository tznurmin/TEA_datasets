To understand the mechanisms underlying these neurological effects, we examined the capacity of WEEV to induce progressive neurodegeneration in outbred CD-1 mice following non-lethal encephalitic infection. Animals were experientally infected with recombinant WEEV expressing firefly luciferase or dsRed (RFP) reporters and the extent of viral replication was controlled using passive immunotherapy. WEEV spread along the neuronal axis from the olfactory bulb to the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and basal midbrain by 4 days post infection (DPI). Infection caused activation of microglia and astrocytes, selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and neurobehavioral abnormalities. After 8 weeks, surviving mice displayed continued loss of dopamine neurons in the SNpc, lingering glial cell activation and gene expression profiles consistent with a neurodegenerative phenotype. Strikingly, prominent proteinase K-resistant protein aggregates were present in the the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and basal midbrain that stained positively for phospho-serine129 α-synuclein (SNCA). These results indicate that WEEV may cause lasting neurological deficits through a severe neuroinflammatory response promoting both neuronal injury and protein aggregation in surviving individuals.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>15</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41531_2019_Article_90.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedicine, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Neurosciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Neurology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by loss of voluntary motor control due to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), associated with oxidative stress, glial cell activation and α-synuclein protein aggregation. Therapies for PD are limited by an insufficient understanding of both the etiological factors and the pathological mechanisms influencing disease progression. The etiology of PD remains elusive but it is likely linked to interactions between genetic risk-factors, age and environmental stressors, including infectious agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Viruses, in particular, have been linked to PD and there have been several reports of parkinsonism observed among human survivors of encephalitic viral infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Exposure of the human central nervous system (CNS) to selected viruses have been shown to induce a phenotype that mimics the neuropathology and neurological dysfunction observed in cases of sporadic PD, and increasing evidence implicates viral infection of the CNS as a potentiating factor in multiple neurodegenerative diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> For example, following the 1918 “Spanish Flu” pandemic, nearly every patient who had an acute episode of encephalitis lethargica went on to develop post-encephalitic parkinsonism, a condition with neurological symptoms that closely resemble PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> In addition, many neurotropic mosquito-borne viruses, including the West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and St. Louis encephalitis virus have been shown to induce PD-like symptoms in humans and rodents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Recent evidence has suggested that over 50% of patients who survive neuroinvasion with WNV exhibit a neurodegenerative phenotype later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup></p><p id="Par3">Older reports indicate that western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), another mosquito-borne alphavirus, may be capable of inducing parkinsonism in humans following encephalitic infection and in a more recent report, 6 of 25 patients from a Colorado epidemic of WEEV presented with a “parkinsonian syndrome” with severe, progressive neurological sequelae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> These symptoms included resting tremor, intellectual deterioration, and cogwheel rigidity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> which persist long after resolution of acute infection with WEEV. This may be due to the chronic presence of viral RNA, because alphavirus RNA can persist in mouse brain 3–17 months after acute infection and could therefore induce a sustained neuroinflammatory reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Alphaviruses alter expression of transcripts associated with interferon signaling and unfolded protein responses, and we have previously shown that infection with WEEV induces expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mouse brain and serum, including MCP-1, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, that are also associated with PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, alphaviruses inhibit mitochondrial bioenergetics, thereby depressing cellular ATP content and inducing oxidative stress, which are associated with neuronal injury in PD and related neurodegenerative disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Although these studies suggest that a single encephalitic infection with WEEV can induce post-encephalitic parkinsonism in the surviving host, the pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear.</p><p id="Par4">To identify mechanisms by which WEEV and related neurotropic alphaviruses cause such persistent neurological deficits following encephalitic infection, we examined the capacity of WEEV to induce progressive neurodegeneration after a single intranasal inoculation in CD-1 mice. We postulated that encephalitic infection WEEV would trigger neuroinflammatory activation of microglia and astrocytes that contributed to neuronal injury and neurobehavioral abnormalities. We demonstrate that intranasal inoculation with recombinant WEEV expressing firefly luciferase (“McFly”) induced a consistent and broad encephalitic infection in outbred CD-1 mice and caused robust glial activation and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc. Morbidity and mortality by intranasal infection ocurred within 4 days but could be attenuated by passive immunotherapy using polyclonal antibodies to the ectodomain of the WEEV E1-glycoprotein to control the extent of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Surviving mice completely cleared the infection by 8 weeks and were examined for pathological features associated with neurodegeneration in multiple brain regions, including cortex, hippocampus, and the basal midbrain. Following inoculation with McFly and immunotherapy, surviving mice displayed selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, as well as behavioral abnormalities and persistent activation of glial cells. In addition, we detected the formation of proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein protein aggregates and a gene expression profile consistent with a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype. In summary, these data indicate that CNS infection with WEEV in wild-type mice causes a pattern of neuronal injury, glial activation and protein aggregation that resembles pathological features of PD and related disorders, which could explain the diagnosis of post-encephalitic parkinsonism in individuals actually infected with WEEV and similar alphaviruses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Infection with recombinant WEEV causes significant neuroinvasion and rapid dissemination from the olfactory bulb throughout the brain</title><p id="Par5">Recombinant WEEV vectors, McFly and McRed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), were constructed to express reporter proteins as markers of infection (firefly luciferase and DsRed), using a duplication of the subgenomic promoter sequence.

Luciferase activity was measured in live, intact animals each day for the duration of the infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). Mice were scored by a clinical scoring system in 12-h increments to assess the severity of the infection on neurobehavioral function. Healthy mice received a score of zero, mice with ruffled received a score of one, mice with slight lethargy, hunched posture and obvious irritable received a score of two, very irritable mice with obvious motor deficits received a score of three, and moribund mice received a score of four. All mice challenged with McFly showed robust luciferase activity and apparent neurobehavioral and motor deficits by 24 h post infection, ranging from slight lethargy and hunched posture to severe hypokinesia and ataxia. Without immunotherapy, mice were unable to survive more than 96 h because of the severity of the encephalitic infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c, d</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">To further characterize the distribution of McFly following intranasal infection, a second cohort of mice was infected and sectioned along the sagittal axis for ex vivo imaging.

At 96 h, McRed-infected multiple nuclei involved in neurodegeneration, the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb (GL), substantia innominate (SI), hippocampus (HIP), thalamus (TH), entorhinal regions of the cortex (ENT), pons, and most notably, the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Whole-brain 3D reconstructions of McRed-infected brains were also performed following subcutaneous and intranasal infection to identify the global distribution of virus throughout the CNS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).

Any animals having luciferase activity within the defined acceptable range of photon counts (demarcated by the dotted red lines in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) were kept in the study. Survival curve analysis of the various treatment strategies showed that two doses of 0.1 mL treatment yielded the highest survival percentage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

Interestingly, we observed equal levels of viral replication in the SNpc and VTA, although the dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appeared to be less affected, demonstrating the selective vulnerability of SNpc dopaminergic neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup></p><p id="Par22">Considering that WEEV is completely cleared from the brain at 8 weeks post infection, the pathological features noted at this time point are likely due to chronic inflammatory activation of glial cells following infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

Neuronal injury from activation of microglia and astrocytes is consistent with that described in other encephalitis models, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), that causes severe glial reactions and release of glial-derived neurotoxic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> Similar to such models of encephalitis, we propose that innate immune inflammatory responses in glial cells are primarily responsible for the reactive gliosis observed after infection with WEEV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> Following viral infection, astrocytes and microglia can adopt a long-lasting neurotoxic and proinflammatory phenotype that may help to combat infection but may also worsen neuronal degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> Consistent with this idea, it was previously reported that infection with WEEV in CD-1 mice resulted in increased cytokine and chemokine expression (CCL2, CXCL10) in surviving animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> Neuroinflammatory activation of glial cells following encephalitic infection could therefore act in concert with neuronal oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction to facilitate protein misfolding and loss of dopaminergic neurons.</p><p id="Par23">Synucleinopathy and gliosis has been reported following infection with WNV and H5N1 influenza A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup> It has been suggested that α-synuclein can restricts replication of RNA viruses in the brain following encephalitic infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> However, whether aggregation of α-synuclein is a pathological consequence of encephalitic infection or a protective mechanism to restrict replication of viral RNA is still unclear. In the current study, we observed the formation of large endogenous proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein aggregates in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, with smaller P129-immunopositive inclusions in the SNpc in mice surviving intranasal infection with WEEV (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We contribute the lack of P129 + in the SNpc likely due to the low expressional levels of SNCA in wild-type mice. Interestingly, we did not detect α-synuclein protein aggregates at 4 DPI, suggesting that development of these pathological protein aggregates was secondary to other sequela of viral infection, such as oxidative stress and inflammatory activation of glial cells. P129 + inclusions appeared to overlap the same neuroanatomical regions that were positive for DsRed following intranasal infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Recent studies have shown a very similar distribution of α-synuclein protein aggregates following stereotactic administration of preformed α-synuclein fibrils (PFFs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup> Following stereotactic administration of PFF into the olfactory bulb, pK-resistant protein plaques were detected in the hippocampus, cortical regions and substantia nigra at 6 months post injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup> Here, we show that the majority of P129 + inclusions did not appear to co-localize with neurons or astrocytes but seemed to be primarily colocalized with IBA1 + microglia. The P129 + cells appeared to be dying neurons which likely no longer express TH and NeuN, explaining the lack of NeuN in P129 + cells. In addition, phagocytosis of dying neuronal populations likely explains the localization of P129 + in microglia, which is consistent with other findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup> Additional studies examining the timecourse of glial activation and protein aggregation will be required to more precisely determine how activation of astrocytes and microglia is linked to aggregation of α-synuclein during infection with WEEV. Reports using stereotactic administration of PFFs into the olfactory bulb did not determine if α-synuclein aggregates in the midbrain spread through direct transneuronal propagation of the originally injected PFFs or from a seeding event that caused the formation of new endogenous α-synuclein aggregates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup> Considering that McFly solely expresses firefly luciferase and that no exogenous α-synuclein was introduced during inoculation, our data suggest that seeding of α-synuclein aggregation following infection with WEEV facilitates the pathological conversion of native α-synuclein into the formation of proteinase K-resistant aggregates in select brain regions. Whether these inclusions spread through a transneuronal mechanism or from glia transmission is still unknown. The presence of α-synuclein in IBA1 + cells is likely facilitating the clearance of protein inclusions from the CNS, as previously noted, but additional longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this finding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup></p><p id="Par24">Common features of neurodegenerative diseases include neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, gliosis, ER-stress, mitochondrial perturbations, autophagy dysfunction, and activation of cell death pathways. We observed significant differences in gene profiles from whole-brain homogenates between surviving host at 3 and 28 DPI. The most significant differences between gene families were involved in lipid metabolism, calcium signaling, inflammation and proteins involved in neurodegeneration. Upregulation of innate immune and cell death modulators was observed at 3 DPI, consistent with a gene profile following acute encephalitic infection. Conversely, we observed a drastic gene profile shift at 28 DPI that produced a pattern of gene expression consistent with a neurodegenerative phenotype: App (amyloid precursor protein), Htt (Huntington), and Park7 (DJ1), which is linked to preservation of mitochondrial function in Parkinson’s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup> Recent evidence has suggested that Phospholipase D1/D2 (<italic>Pld1, Pld2</italic>) significantly modify autophagy during nutrient deprivation and are direct downstream targets of amyloid precursor protein (APP), possibly explaining the significant upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Activation of surrounding glia is likely a key contributor as well, similar to that described in other encephalitic infections causing severe glial activation and release of glial-derived neurotoxic mediators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> Aldh1a1, an astrocytic differentiation marker, was significantly increased in the 28 DPI group.

The onset, progression and clearance of the infection was demonstrated by in vivo bioluminescence and fluorescent imaging of virally expressed firefly luciferase and dsRed. Examination of surviving mice revealed significant gait abnormalities, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc and VTA, loss of TH-positive terminals in the striatum, long-lasting glia activation, the formation of proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein inclusions and a gene expression profile consistent with neurodegeneration. The selective and rapid loss of TH + dopamine neurons and development of proteinase K-resistant α-synuclein aggregates from a single inoculation with WEEV, coupled with high specificity for the SNpc, may help to explain why encephalitic infection with mosquito-borne alphavirus can cause parkinsonism in humans. Further work is required to determine how dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc appear to be selectively vulnerable to infection with WEEV. Consistent with clinical cases of encephalitic infection with this virus, the experimental results presented here indicate that the pattern of neuropathological injury and progression of neurodegeneration following infection with WEEV resembles certain features of parkinsonism. It is particularly striking that infection with WEEV caused the development of α-synuclein aggregates within 8 weeks of infection in wild-type mice. This finding, combined with rapid progression, glial activation, and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons within the SNpc suggest that recombinant WEEV, when used in conjunction with immunotherapy, could be a robust animal model for studying neurodegenerative mechanisms relevant to PD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Viruses</title><p id="Par26">A full-length infectious clone of the WEEV McMillan strain was derived from an isolate obtained from the Arbovirus Reference Collection at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Fort Collins, CO, USA, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup> Detailed descriptions of the molecular cloning methods used to construct recombinant WEEV reporter viruses have been previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> In brief, duplication of the subgenomic promoter (SGP) sequence (nucleotides 7341–7500 of viral genome) of WEEV McMillan strain was used to express of firefly luciferase.
