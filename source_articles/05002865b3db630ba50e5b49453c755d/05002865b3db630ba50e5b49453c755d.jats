However, the mechanism underlying PD-related peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis remains unclear. NLRP3 inflammasome regulates the caspase-1-dependent release of interleukin-1β and mediates inflammation in various diseases. Here, we investigated the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in a murine model of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis induced by methylglyoxal (MGO). Inflammasome-related proteins were upregulated in the peritoneum of MGO-treated mice. MGO induced parietal and visceral peritoneal fibrosis in wild-type mice, which was significantly reduced in mice deficient in NLRP3, ASC, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). ASC deficiency reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic factors, and the infiltration of macrophages. However, myeloid cell-specific ASC deficiency failed to inhibit MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis. MGO caused hemorrhagic ascites, fibrin deposition, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 upregulation, but all of these manifestations were inhibited by ASC deficiency. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showed that MGO induced cell death via the generation of reactive oxygen species in vascular endothelial cells, which was inhibited by ASC deficiency. Our results showed that endothelial NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to PD-related peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis, and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disorder.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution><institution-id

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a renal replacement therapy used by approximately 200,000 patients with end-stage kidney disease worldwide, accounting for 11% of the PD population. Long-term PD leads to fibrotic changes of the peritoneum with functional decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, peritoneal fibrosis can, albeit rarely, progresses to fibrous encapsulation of the small bowels as a “cocoon”, known as encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The pathological feature of EPS is fibrin deposition due to plasma exudation from peritoneal microvessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Recent studies have demonstrated that inflammation induced by bio-incompatible PD fluids (PDFs) and/or infections is involved in the pathogenesis of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In particular, heat sterilization of conventional PDFs leads to the generation of glucose degradation products (GDPs), such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal (MGO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Of these, MGO is an extremely toxic GDP that causes oxidative stress and peritoneal injury. MGO has also been shown to enhance the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may lead to vascular permeability and procoagulant activity. Furthermore, MGO administration induces peritoneal fibrosis in experimental rodents, which is frequently used as an animal model of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying inflammation in the development of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis have not been fully understood.</p><p id="Par3">Accumulating body of evidence suggests that inflammation in the absence of pathogens (sterile inflammation) is mediated via the inflammasome; an intracellular multi-protein complex that regulates release of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can form the inflammasome complex, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is well characterized and has been implicated in sterile inflammatory diseases. The NLRP3 inflammasome contains NLRP3 associated with an apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), which recruits caspase-1 and induces its activation. Since caspase-1 is an IL-1β-converting enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, NLRP3 inflammasome-driven caspase-1 activation induces the processing of pro-IL-1β into its mature form, and the release of this potent inflammatory cytokine IL-1β causes tissue inflammation and damage. Furthermore, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome also triggers inflammatory cell death termed as pyroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Our group recently demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in sterile inflammatory responses in cardiovascular and renal diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Supporting our findings, recent investigations have also shown that NLRP3 inflammasome is a key mediator of many sterile inflammation-related diseases including gout, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We and other investigators have also shown that NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the expression of fibrotic factors and the development of tissue fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Additionally, NLRP3 itself has been suggested to contribute to the signaling of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in tubular epithelial cells and to promote renal fibrosis independent of the inflammasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Further, Hautem <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> recently reported that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in transport defects and morphological alterations in PD-related bacterial peritonitis. However, the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in PD-related peritoneal fibrosis remains to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par4">In the present study, we used mice deficient in NLRP3, ASC, and IL-1β, and generated MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis, which is an excellent murine model for human PD-related peritoneal fibrosis. We clearly showed that deficiency of NLRP3, ASC, or IL-1β reduced inflammatory and fibrotic responses in a MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis model. MGO also caused peritoneal bleeding and fibrin deposition, and subsequently promoted peritoneal fibrosis, all of these manifestations were inhibited by ASC deficiency. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments showed that MGO generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced cell death in endothelial cells, which was inhibited by ASC deficiency. The present findings showed that endothelial NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to peritoneal inflammatory and fibrotic responses in the pathophysiology of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis, and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disorder.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Inflammasome-related proteins were up-regulated in MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis</title><p id="Par5">To produce a murine model of MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis, we injected MGO (40 mM) intraperitoneally into wild-type (WT) mice, and Masson’s Trichrome (MT) staining showed that MGO significantly induced fibrous thickening of the parietal peritoneum in a time-dependent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). We next assessed the expression of inflammasome-related proteins by using real-time RT-PCR analysis and found that the peritoneal expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1β was elevated in a time-dependent manner, and this increase was statistically significant at 21 days after MGO treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). We also assessed the expression of other inflammasome-forming PRRs, there was no significant differences of the mRNA expression of NLRP1, NLRC4 (NLR family CARD-containing 4), and AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) between vehicle- and MGO-treated groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). The peritoneal expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β was also significantly elevated at 14 and 21 days after MGO treatment. To further investigate the peritoneal fibrotic process, we assessed fibrotic changes in the visceral peritoneum and found that MGO induced shrinkage of the mesentery, and its area was apparently decreased after MGO treatment in a time-dependent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d,e</xref>). Furthermore, some mice exhibited bowel adhesions, a clinical presentation similar to EPS, at 21 days after MGO treatment. Consistently, the expression of inflammasome-related molecules tended to be elevated in the visceral peritoneum after MGO treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Inflammasome-related molecules were up-regulated in MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis.

However, the mechanisms underlying sterile peritoneal inflammation resulting from prolonged exposure to PDFs and leading to peritoneal fibrosis and EPS remain to be elucidated. Meanwhile, we and other investigators have recently shown that NLRP3 inflammasome drives sterile inflammation in various diseases, such as cardiovascular and renal diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In the present study, we showed that deficiency of NLRP3, ASC, and IL-1β attenuates inflammatory and fibrotic responses after MGO treatment, resulting in less peritoneal fibrosis in a murine model of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis and EPS. Several murine models are commonly used to study the pathogenesis of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis including the administration of chlorhexidine gluconate (CG), acidic (pH 3.8) glucose solution, and MGO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Although some histological features of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis are seen in these models, it is accepted that MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis is more appropriate for studying the pathogenesis of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis because conventional PD fluids contain GDPs including MGO. In addition, the MGO model exhibits histological hallmarks similar to those of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis, such as thickening of the submesothelial compact zone, infiltration of inflammatory cells, capillary angiogenesis, and fibrin deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, in addition to these histological features, we found that MGO treatment induces shrinkage of the mesentery and bowel adhesions, which are clinical presentations similar to those in EPS, and these are inhibited by ASC deficiency. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in sterile peritoneal inflammation and subsequent fibrosis in PD-related peritoneal fibrosis and EPS.</p><p id="Par14">Recent investigations have suggested that inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages, contribute to the process of peritoneal fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, because the NLRP3 inflammasome is thought to play a role mainly in inflammatory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, we assessed MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis in myeloid cell-specific ASC-deficient mice. Unexpectedly, however, myeloid cell-specific ASC deficiency failed to inhibit MGO-induced inflammatory and fibrotic responses, and subsequent peritoneal fibrosis. Supporting this, Huen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> previously reported that macrophage-specific deletion of TGF-β did not prevent renal fibrosis after ischemia-reperfusion or obstructive injury. Nezu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> also reported that myeloid-specific Keap1 deletion had no effect on tubular damage in ischemia-reperfusion kidneys while tubule-specific Keap1 deletion ameliorated kidney tubular damage. These reports suggest that other cell types likely contribute to the development of fibrosis. We then focused on vascular endothelial cells for the following reasons. First, we observed that ASC deficiency had inhibitory effects on endothelial cell damage, such as hemorrhagic ascites, fibrin deposition, and the expression of PAI-1. Fibrin is considered to be derived from plasma exudation from peritoneal microvessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, the levels of PAI, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, have been shown to be increased in patients with PD and correlated with the duration of treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Second, recent studies have suggested that NLRP3 inflammasome-driven inflammatory response and cell death can occur in vascular endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Furthermore, endothelial damage and angiogenesis are known to be the hallmarks of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis and EPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Using human and murine primary vascular endothelial cells, we showed that MGO markedly induces cell death through ROS generation, which is prevented by ASC deficiency, suggesting that endothelial NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the process of PD-related peritoneal fibrosis.</p><p id="Par15">Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, although we showed that NLRP3 deficiency significantly attenuates MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis, we have not examined whether deficiency of other inflammasome-forming PRRs, such as NLRP1, NLRC4, and AIM2, could inhibit peritoneal fibrosis. In this regard, we observed no significant changes of these molecules in mice after MGO treatment; therefore, we assume that NLRP1, NLRC4, and AIM2 inflammasomes are less likely to be involved in MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis. Second, although MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis was significantly attenuated in IL-1β-deficient mice, we could not detect substantial IL-1β production in response to MGO in cultured endothelial cells (data now shown). Third, although we clearly showed that MGO induced ASC-dependent cell death in endothelial cells, its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Recent investigations have indicated that the inflammasome activation induces a particular form of cell death called pyroptosis by the cleavage of gasdermin D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. On the other hand, ASC has shown to be involved in other types of cell death, such as caspase-8-mediated apoptosis or necrosis distinct from necroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanism and role of NLRP3 inflammasome in PD-related peritoneal fibrosis.</p><p id="Par16">In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that NLRP3 inflammasome triggers vascular endothelial cell damage and subsequent peritoneal inflammatory and fibrotic responses, resulting in MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis.

MLVECs were cultured on a gelatin-coated dish in 20% FCS/DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 50 μg/mL endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 μg/mL heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 μM SB431542 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and 1% antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 72–96 h. Endothelial cells were identified by a cobblestone-like morphology and specific expression for VE-cadherin. MLVECs with 3–4 passages were used. HUVECs were obtained commercially (ScienCell Research Laboratories, San Diego, CA) and cultured in EC medium (ScienCell Research Laboratories). HUVECs with 5–7 passages were used for the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Cell death assay and ROS detection</title><p id="Par24">Cell death was assessed with SYTOX Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific), a membrane-impermeable DNA dye that enters dead cells.
