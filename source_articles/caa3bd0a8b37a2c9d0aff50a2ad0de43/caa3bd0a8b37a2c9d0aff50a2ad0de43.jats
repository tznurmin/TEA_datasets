Research on <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> pathogenesis has primarily focused on pneumonia and bloodstream infections, even though one in five <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains are isolated from urinary sites. In this study, we highlight the role of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> as a uropathogen. We develop the first <italic>A. baumannii</italic> catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) murine model using UPAB1, a recent MDR urinary isolate. UPAB1 carries the plasmid pAB5, a member of the family of large conjugative plasmids that represses the type VI secretion system (T6SS) in multiple <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> strains. pAB5 confers niche specificity, as its carriage improves UPAB1 survival in a CAUTI model and decreases virulence in a pneumonia model. Comparative proteomic and transcriptomic analyses show that pAB5 regulates the expression of multiple chromosomally-encoded virulence factors besides T6SS. Our results demonstrate that plasmids can impact bacterial infections by controlling the expression of chromosomal genes.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2"><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is generally considered an opportunistic pathogen.

In many cases, these microbial factors are also determinants of virulence and dictate the spectrum of disease associated with the pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. For example, some structural features of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> capsule appear to be essential for colonization of the human respiratory tract, but negatively influence survival in blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In contrast, incidental pathogens with environmental, non-human reservoirs are largely considered to be “niche nonspecific opportunistic pathogens”. These pathogens generally cause a wide spectrum of disease dependent on permissive hosts, such as patients that are immunocompromised or critically ill, suffer from breaks in normal immune barriers, or whose microbiomes are perturbed by antimicrobial therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is generally considered an opportunistic pathogen with no specificity for a particular niche. As a pathogen, it is primarily associated with nosocomial infections, mainly hospital acquired pneumonia, bacteremia, soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infections (UTI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, although cases of community acquired infections have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, <italic>A. baumannii</italic> is recognized as a serious health threat worldwide due to the emerging prevalence of clinical isolates that are multidrug resistant (MDR). Indeed, because <italic>A. baumannii</italic> MDR rates are at least fourfold higher than those for <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, the second most MDR Gram-negative pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, the World Health Organization identified <italic>A. baumannii</italic> as a top priority for the research and development of new antimicrobial therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, an incomplete understanding of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> ecology and pathophysiology limits the development of alternative therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="Par4">The two <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains most commonly used in pathogenesis research, ATCC19606 and ATCC17978<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, are non-MDR, lab-domesticated strains that were isolated over 50 years ago. These strains exhibit reduced virulence compared to more recent clinical isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and lack virulence factors identified in modern <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains, such as the recently described protease CpaA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In order to employ more relevant strains, recent research efforts have adopted contemporary model strains, such as the hypervirulent isolates Ab5075 and LAC-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Under the assumption that pathogenic isolates are equally competent in establishing infection in different anatomical niches in a permissive host, <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> strains are often investigated using infection models that do not match their clinical history. For example, strain Ab5075, isolated in 2008 from a bone infection, has been employed to investigate respiratory infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. <italic>A. baumannii</italic> virulence is principally investigated in vivo using murine pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and sepsis models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, with only a few reports using soft tissue infection models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Notably, despite early reports highlighting <italic>A. baumannii</italic> as the principal cause of catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) in some clinical settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, there is no established model to investigate <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection in the unique environment of the urinary tract. Thus, current infection models may not be adequate to investigate the full spectrum of <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> disease.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we report that up to one-fifth of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolates are obtained from urinary sources, according to a local retrospective study and a systematic review of literature from the last 25 years. To investigate this significant manifestation of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> disease, we develop a murine model of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> CAUTI using a recent MDR UTI isolate, UPAB1. We demonstrate that UPAB1 is able to establish early implant and bladder colonization, dependent on chaperone-usher pathway (CUP) pili. We discovered that UPAB1 harbors a large conjugative plasmid, pAB5, and showed that pAB5 increases UPAB1 virulence in the CAUTI model but is detrimental in a murine pneumonia model. We linked this behavior to the remarkable ability of pAB5 to impact the expression of multiple chromosomally-encoded virulence factors, such as pili, exopolysaccharides, and protein secretion systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The urinary tract is a major source of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolates</title><p id="Par6">We performed a retrospective analysis of all <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> isolates identified in the BJC Healthcare System (BJC) from January 2007 through August 2017.

To validate the CAUTI model as a tool for identifying factors involved in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> uropathogenesis, we sequenced the 3.9 Mbp genome of UPAB1 (accession number CP032215-CP032220).

Accordingly, a UPAB1 derivative lacking pAB5, UPAB1p-, displayed increased susceptibility to multiple antibiotics and activation of the T6SS, as observed by secretion of the T6SS-associated protein Hcp (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Repression of T6SS and/or other bacterial genes by pAB5 could impact the pathogenic potential of UPAB1.

Unexpectedly, 36 h after intranasal inoculation, we observed that mice infected with plasmid-containing UPAB1 WT carried one to four logs less bacterial burden in their lungs, spleens, livers, kidneys and hearts, compared to mice infected with UPAB1p- (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The differences in bacterial burdens were less pronounced in the lung than in the other organs, indicating that pAB5 effects are amplified during bacterial dissemination. Moreover, mice infected with UPAB1p- displayed 60% survival at 36 hpi, in contrast to 100% survival in mice infected with WT UPAB1.

Thus, investigations performed on UPAB1 are applicable to a relevant portion of <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> isolates, and a validated murine CAUTI model will be an important tool for developing interventions against the growing tide of MDR UTIs.</p><p id="Par17">Remarkably, we found that the LCP pAB5 has a global influence on the physiology of UPAB1. pAB5 confers UPAB1 with improved survival in the urinary tract, but attenuates its virulence in a pulmonary model, highlighting the relevance of an under-appreciated feature of bacterial plasmids. LCPs like pAB5 were previously shown to repress T6SS in its bacterial host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, it was unclear whether LCPs mediate additional effects on gene expression. Here, we identified multiple surface molecules and metabolic pathways whose expression was affected by the presence of the plasmid, and these regulatory networks could explain the differential findings in murine models. In addition to the TetR regulators shown to be sufficient for T6SS suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, pAB5 contains several putative transcriptional factors (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) that could directly alter the expression of chromosomally-encoded factors identified in our study. Alternatively, a plasmid-encoded factor might interact with unidentified, chromosomal master regulators that in turn impact the bacterial transcriptome. A third possibility is that presence of the plasmid is intrinsically sensed by the bacterium, triggering changes in the expression of several chromosomal factors. This latter scenario is not consistent with the observation that conjugation of pAB3 and pAB4 into UPAB1 does not alter PNAG expression. The fact that growth conditions also influence expression of virulence factors modulated by pAB5, indicates that pAB5 transcriptional effects are integrated into the global regulatory network of UPAB1. Virulence plasmids, i.e. plasmids encoding virulence factors, have been well-studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Although we cannot exclude the role of a putative plasmid-encoded virulence factor in CAUTI, our results show that pAB5 modulates the expression of multiple chromosomally-encoded factors, effecting the UPAB1 bacterial surface. Most <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> strains possess a constitutively active T6SS. LCP conjugation requires the survival of the recipient, which is the target of the T6SS. We have recently showed that T6SS repression by LCP enable plasmid dissemination and the propagation of MDR among <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Thus, while the ability to conjugate may be the driving force behind T6SS repression by LCP, whether regulation of other chromosomal factors is beneficial for the plasmid remains to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par18">Bacterial plasmids that control chromosomally-encoded genes have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. However, the broad impact on bacterial genome expression and pathobiology by pAB5 has not been reported for any other plasmid. Future work to elucidate the mechanisms through which pAB5 affects UPAB1 uropathogenesis will be needed. Since plasmid biology was largely researched prior to the “omics” era, revisiting these topics with modern tools may unveil additional effects that plasmids have on the expression of virulence factors of other bacteria. Even though the mechanistic details remain unclear, LCP carriage dictates differential <italic>A. baumannii</italic> survival in different host anatomical sites. Our findings challenge the dogma that opportunistic pathogens, such as <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, are niche nonspecific, and future investigations into the pathobiology of these bacteria must consider the clinical context of model strains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p id="Par19">Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>.

Variance stabilizing transformation of read count was analyzed as a heatmap and principal component figure. DEG analysis was performed by comparing UPAB1 with pAB5 versus UPAB1 cured of pAB5 separately for shaking and static growth. Per the DESeq2 vignette, genes with adjusted p-values &lt;.1 were determined to be significantly differentially expressed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>PNAG detection by Congo Red plates</title><p id="Par41">The colony morphology of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains was studied on plates containing Congo red agar composed of SOBG media (SOB media+2% glycerol) supplemented with 40 µg/ml of Congo red (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>.

For comparison of bacterial load in the murine CAUTI model, statistical analyses were performed using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. For the murine acute pneumonia model, data were log transformed and analyzed for Gaussian distribution using the D’Angostino-Pearson omnibus normality test. Data sets displaying Gaussian distribution were then analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. Data sets displaying non-Gaussian distribution were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons. For all other assays, normal data distribution was checked with the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. For normally distributed datasets, parametric one-way ANOVA was performed with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons. For non-normally distributed datasets, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons was used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par43">Further information on research design is available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM9">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the imaging laboratory of Molecular Microbiology Department at Washington University in St Louis, especially W.
