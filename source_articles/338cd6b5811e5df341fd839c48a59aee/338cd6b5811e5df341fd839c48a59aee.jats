Here we show that the anti-inflammatory protein A20 and the critical autophagic mediator Atg16l1 physically interact and synergize to regulate the stability of the intestinal epithelial barrier. A proteomic screen using the WD40 domain of ATG16L1 (WDD) identified A20 as a WDD-interacting protein. Loss of A20 and Atg16l1 in mouse intestinal epithelium induces spontaneous IBD-like pathology, as characterized by severe inflammation and increased intestinal epithelial cell death in both small and large intestine. Mechanistically, absence of A20 promotes Atg16l1 accumulation, while elimination of Atg16l1 or expression of WDD-deficient Atg16l1 stabilizes A20. Collectively our data show that A20 and Atg16l1 cooperatively control intestinal homeostasis by acting at the intersection of inflammatory, autophagy and cell death pathways.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">Maintaining the intestinal barrier function requires a balance of multiple signalling pathways.

Crohn’s disease, which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, and ulcerative colitis, which is restricted to the colon mucosa, are the two main clinical manifestations of IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In healthy conditions, the intestinal epithelium maintains a solid physical barrier established by the tight contact of cells preventing bacterial infiltration and subsequent inflammation. Moreover, specialized secretory epithelial cell types such as Paneth and goblet cells provide innate immune defense functions by secreting antibacterial peptides and mucus, limiting bacterial adhesion and infiltration. Hence, IBD is thought to arise in genetically predisposed individuals due to exaggerated responses of the host immune system to intestinal bacteria, and defects in maintaining the stability of the mucosal barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 200 genes associated with IBD, many of which are involved in the regulation of innate immune responses and intestinal epithelial functions, including <italic>A20</italic> and <italic>ATG16L1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The intestinal epithelium senses luminal antigens through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like receptors, and C-type lectin receptors, leading to the activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although generally linked to inflammation, NF-κB activation in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is essential for regulating important protective mechanisms including maintaining gut barrier integrity by inducing anti-apoptotic proteins, antimicrobial peptides, and mucins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, aberrant NF-κB activation leads to the production of numerous inflammatory mediators, causing chronic inflammation. Indeed, excessive NF-κB activation can be observed in mucosa of IBD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and in experimental mouse models of colitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. An important anti-inflammatory and enterocyte protective factor induced by NF-κB is A20 (also known as TNFα-induced protein 3, <italic>TNFAIP3</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. A20 acts as a ubiquitin-editing protein that terminates NF-κB and cell death signaling in response to PRR and cytokine receptor stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. IEC-specific deletion of A20 was shown to sensitize mice to experimental colitis and TNF toxicity, due to increased epithelial apoptosis, identifying A20 as a crucial barrier protective factor, indispensable for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity during inflammatory stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The physiological importance of A20 in intestinal pathology is further strengthened by the identification of <italic>A20/TNFAIP3</italic> polymorphisms associated with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. GWAS have also identified polymorphisms in <italic>ATG16L1</italic> and other autophagy-related genes in IBD, suggesting autophagy-dependent mechanisms for controlling intestinal immune homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. ATG16L1 mediates the assembly of a macromolecular complex that lipidates LC3/ATG8 to promote formation of canonical double-membrane autophagosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, ATG16L1 also performs alternative activities that are apparently unrelated to autophagosome generation, including anti-inflammatory functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Mammalian ATG16L1 includes a C-terminal domain formed by 7 WD40-type repetitions (the WD40 domain, WDD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> that is dispensable for the canonical autophagic pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Instead, this region appears to function as a docking site for adapter proteins that engage ATG16L1 to perform unconventional activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Consistent with this idea, the anti-inflammatory role of ATG16L1 in NOD signaling has been proposed to involve interaction between NOD1/2 and the WDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Identification of WDD adapter molecules and their associated functions is likely to provide novel insights into how ATG16L1 regulates inflammation and other unconventional activities.</p><p id="Par5">The most common IBD-linked polymorphism in <italic>ATG16L1</italic>, the T300A allele, was shown to prevent binding of the WDD to proteins containing a novel WDD-binding amino acid motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and also to facilitate ATG16L1 processing by caspase 3 leading to defects in anti-bacterial autophagy and enhanced cytokine responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Knock-in mice expressing the Atg16l1 T300A variant also display morphological defects in Paneth and goblet cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

However, disease development may require the convergence of multiple defects affecting several layers of control on intestinal immune homeostasis, due to functional redundancy or molecular compensatory counterbalance mechanisms.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we identify A20 as a direct binding partner of the WDD of ATG16L1, and examine whether a genetic interaction might exist in the context of intestinal homeostasis. We find that A20 restricts Atg16l1 accumulation, and vice versa, to regulate autophagic, inflammatory, and cell death responses. To study their functional relationship in vivo, we generate mice with double A20 and Atg16l1 deficiency in the intestinal epithelial compartment. These A20-Atg16l1<sup>ΔIEC</sup> mice develop spontaneous IBD-like pathology characterized by severe inflammation in both small and large intestine, crypt abscesses with marked epithelial cell death, Paneth cell loss, and villi erosion, in contrast to single A20<sup>ΔIEC</sup> or Atg16l1<sup>ΔIEC</sup> mice, which do not develop overt intestinal abnormalities nor inflammation in homeostatic conditions. Together, our data indicate that inflammatory, cell death and autophagy signaling converge at the level of A20 and Atg16l1 to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis, while each protein can compensate for the other’s loss to some extent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Proteomic identification of ATG16L1 WDD-binding proteins</title><p id="Par8">In order to characterize the physiological function of the ATG16L1 WDD, we developed a proteomics approach to identify proteins able to interact with this region.

Initial optimization studies showed that a GST-ATG16L1 chimera containing the WDD as annotated in sequence databases (residues 320–607) showed lower expression levels compared to a longer version that includes amino acids 231–607 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1A</xref>), consistent with the recently published structure of the WDD showing that position 320 interrupts a beta strand that might be part of the domain and important for its stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, we focused on expressing GST-ATG16L1-231-607 in JAR (choriocarcinoma) and THP-1 (monocytic) cells for subsequent proteomic studies.

Co-immunoprecipitation assays between GST-ATG16L1 fusion constructs and deleted versions of A20 showed that the N-terminal region of A20 (amino acids 1–263) is sufficient to bind full-length ATG16L1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The WDD of ATG16L1 (residues 320–607) mediates this interaction in both HEK293T (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2A</xref>) and intestinal HCT116 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2B</xref>) cells. Residues 92–263 containing the OTU domain that harbors the deubiquitinating activity was the minimal region of A20 able to bind the WDD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Interestingly, the interaction between ATG16L1 and A20 is not altered by the T300A allele that increases the risk for Crohn’s disease (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3A</xref>). Previous results showed that the WDD recognizes an amino acid motif comprising [YFW]-X-X-L as the critical positions, an element originally identified in the intracellular region of the transmembrane molecule TMEM59<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We found 7 versions of an inclusive form of this motif ([YFW]-X-X-[LVI]) in the 92–263 domain of A20. Inactivation of each individual motif by mutation of both essential residues to alanine did not inhibit co-precipitation between the WDD and A20–1–263 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3B</xref>), but simultaneous mutation of all motifs impaired such interaction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3C</xref>). These results suggest that the different WDD-binding motifs present in the N-terminal region of A20 cooperatively participate in the recognition of the WDD.

To study the effect of A20 deficiency on inflammatory signaling and autophagy, we evaluated the expression of autophagy markers after TNF stimulation in A20 wild-type and A20 deficient MEFs. As previously reported, A20 deficient cells show prolonged phosphorylation and sustained degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory molecule IκBα, consistent with the importance of A20 as a negative feedback regulator of inducible NF-κB activation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In addition to the enhanced activation of the NF-κB pathway, Atg16l1 expression levels are increased in A20-deficient cells, and more microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) protein associates with phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3-II), both in basal conditions and upon TNF treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4A</xref>). Also p62, a multifaceted scaffolding protein involved in trafficking proteins to autophagy (and itself a substrate for autophagic degradation), is slightly induced in A20 deficient MEFs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), suggesting reduced autophagic flux. However, accumulation of LC3-II in the absence of A20 persisted after lysosomal inhibition with bafilomycin (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5A, B</xref>), arguing that it reflects enhanced autophagic flux in A20-deficient cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of the WDD in A20-deficient cells inhibited LC3-II induction by TNF in a dominant-negative manner (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5C</xref>), suggesting that the autophagic response has unconventional, WDD-mediated features that might help explain the apparently contradicting behavior of LC3-II and p62 in this setting. Alternatively, p62 is an NF-κB response gene which can be strongly induced in absence of A20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Atg16l1 expression is also induced in small intestinal organoids from A20 deficient mice, particularly in response to TNF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4B</xref>).

However, we have no evidence that Atg16l1 is ubiquitinated and/or stabilized upon inhibition of the proteasome (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>), so the molecular mechanism causing enhanced Atg16l1 expression in absence of A20 remains elusive.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A20 deficiency increases Atg16l1 expression and LC3-II expression levels. <bold>a</bold> Immortalized MEFs were stimulated with 1000 IU/ml of recombinant murine TNF for indicated time points.

In these assays we were unable to recapitulate the impact of A20-deficiency on ATG16L1 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>), perhaps because the subtle effect observed for endogenous Atg16l1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) is lost when both contenders are expressed at higher levels. However, we found reduced A20 expression levels in the presence of full-length ATG16L1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), particularly upon TNF treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Cells reconstituted with the N-terminal region of ATG16L1 (residues 1–299 that suffice to sustain autophagy) showed recovered A20 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>), indicating that ATG16L1 downregulates A20 through the WDD. Both A20 and ATG16L1 are expressed from constitutive retroviral transgenes in this system, so the observed changes in A20 abundance are likely to be post-transcriptional. Consistently, treatment with lysosomal inhibitors (bafilomycin, E64d/pepstatin) tended to normalize A20 expression levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7A</xref>), arguing that a lysosomal pathway (perhaps autophagy) degrades A20 more intensely in the presence of full-length ATG16L1. While the N-terminal domain of ATG16L1 fully restored the basal autophagic flux in A20-positive cells (p62 and LC3 blots in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>), its LC3 lipidating activity was deregulated in cells lacking A20 expression (increased levels of LC3-II but no impact on p62 clearance; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>), thus revealing a functional epistasis between A20 and the WDD in the control of LC3 lipidation. More generally, ATG16L1 only restored the basal autophagic flux in cells harboring A20 (see p62 Western-blots in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>), pointing to a wider function of A20 in the regulation of autophagy. To examine the impact of ATG16L1 WDD-dependent degradation of A20 in NF-κB activation, we measured NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity induced by TNF in all restored cell lines. In these assays we found that the WDD of ATG16L1 regulates NF-κB activation in cells lacking A20, because cells expressing FL-ATG16L1 were less responsive than those devoid of ATG16L1 expression or those harboring just the N-terminal domain (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7B</xref>). All strains restored with HA-A20 showed poor NF-κB activation irrespective of their ATG16L1 status, likely because A20 overexpression dominantly inhibits the activity.</p><p id="Par12">In an extension of these studies, we confirmed that endogenous A20 is also upregulated in TNF-treated Atg16l1-deficient MEFs compared to their wild-type counterparts, with the appearance of modified, higher molecular weight forms of A20 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8A</xref>). A20 expression returned back to normal levels in cells restored with full-length HA-ATG16L1, but not when just the N-terminal domain was present (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8A</xref>), suggesting that the WDD mediates the inhibitory effect that ATG16L1 has on A20 expression levels. Parallel NF-κB activation assays showed that Atg16l1-deficient MEFs respond better to TNF treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8B</xref>), pointing again to the idea that Atg16L1 represses NF-κB activation. Consistently, re-introduction of ATG16L1 or the N-terminal domain in <italic>Atg16l1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells suppressed the signal, although the latter was less efficient (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8B</xref>). These data argue that Atg16l1 regulates NF-κB signaling at least in part through a mechanism involving the WDD. Intriguingly, the NF-κB inhibitory potential of ATG16L1 in this context appears unrelated to its ability to regulate A20 expression, since Atg16l1-deficient cells actually show increased levels of A20 (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8A</xref>), and A20 is generally thought to repress the NF-κB pathway induced by TNF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

However, and in contrast to the three other genotypes, we were not able to obtain organoid cultures isolated from dKO animals, and all dKO cells spontaneously start dying within one week of isolation. Moreover, during this short period of culture, dKO organoids display an abnormal phenotype and maintain a spheroid shape with minimal sproutings (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>).

Many of the IBD-associated genes identified so far are involved in the regulation of innate immune responses and intestinal epithelial functions. First evidence involving autophagy in IBD came with the identification of <italic>ATG16L1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, findings which have shortly after been confirmed in experimental studies in mice with hypomorphic or deficient <italic>Atg16l1</italic> alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms by which autophagy controls intestinal homeostasis are still unclear. Autophagy is induced upon various types of cellular stress and contributes to innate immune responses. Hence, defects in autophagy may impair host defense and induce inflammatory reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In this study, we investigated the importance of Atg16l1 for intestinal homeostasis by studying its interplay with the ubiquitin-editing protein A20, an essential negative regulator of inflammatory signaling, in IECs. Our results demonstrate that, in contrast to mice with single A20 or Atg16l1 deficiency in IECs that develop normally without intestinal defects, the combined loss of both proteins leads to spontaneous IBD-like pathology in mice. Substantial evidence has demonstrated cell death to be a central feature in IBD which can be triggered by epithelial cell death inducing barrier disruption, allowing infiltration of luminal bacteria into the mucosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Since both A20 deficient and Atg16l1 deficient IECs are highly sensitive to cytokine-induced cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, this suggests that both proteins are indispensable to prevent barrier destruction in inflammatory conditions. In normal conditions with minimal cytokine exposure, A20 and ATG16L1 can compensate for each other’s loss and preserve intestinal barrier integrity. However, upon loss of both A20 and ATG16L1, spontaneous barrier disintegration and chronic intestinal inflammation develops. These data support the growing notion that inflammatory signaling and autophagy cooperatively control intestinal homeostasis by preventing the death of enterocytes that would compromise intestinal barrier integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Both apoptosis and necroptosis have been associated with IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and although apoptotic death is considered less inflammatory due to the containment of the cell content within apoptotic bodies, we believe that in our A20-Atg16l1 dKO model apoptosis of the intestinal epithelial cells is the driving cell death mode triggering chronic intestinal inflammation, given the clear observation of cleaved caspase-3 positive cells in dKO mice.</p><p id="Par21">One of the phenotypes observed in A20/Atg16l1 dKO mice is a reduction in goblet and Paneth cells (particularly the latter), a phenomenon typically seen in IBD patients and in many experimental IBD mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Both are specialized secretory cell types responsible for the production of mucus and antimicrobial peptides, respectively, preventing bacterial infiltration, and hence are highly sensitive to ER stress and inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. A20 or Atg16l1 deficiency in IECs does not cause spontaneous Paneth or goblet cell death, but sensitizes to their loss in inflammatory conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Our data showing that the combined deletion of A20 and Atg16l1 provokes loss of Paneth and goblet cells sustains the idea that defects in the innate defense mechanisms linked to these cells elicit barrier defects and contribute to the spontaneous development of intestinal pathology. These data are in line with previous work, showing that loss of either regulators of ER stress or modulators of autophagy result in each other’s compensatory engagement and that spontaneous pathology only develops in case both mechanisms are defective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">We also identified a direct physical interaction and functional interplay between A20 and Atg16l1 that could constitute an important control point for intestinal homeostasis. First, we show that A20 and Atg16l1 physically interact through their OTU and WD40 domains, respectively. Second, we observed increased expression levels of Atg16l1 and LC3-II in A20-deficient conditions, reflecting enhanced autophagic flux promoted by a WDD-dependent unconventional activity of Atg16l1. Third, we found that A20 expression levels are induced in the absence of Atg16l1 due to the elimination of a WDD-mediated and lysosome-dependent activity of Atg16l1 that degrades A20. These data support the notion that Atg16l1 and A20 normally keep each other in check by mutually reducing their expression levels, a post-transcriptional cross-regulation that likely relies on their direct interaction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12A</xref>). Absence of one of the partners triggers a compensatory upregulation of the other that helps quench the aggressive intestinal inflammatory phenotype observed in double-deficient mice. The exact identity of the downstream pathways that mediate such compensation is unclear. Our data suggest that induction of Atg16l1 in A20-deficient cells promotes unconventional autophagy, enhanced p62 expression and decreased NF-κB activation that may help keep under control the elevated levels of NF-κB caused by absence of A20 (see summary in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12B</xref>). Conversely, A20 upregulation in cells lacking Atg16l1 correlates with higher levels of p62, increased NF-κB activation and, according to the abundant literature on the functional role of A20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, probably increased protection against cell death (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12A</xref>). Therefore it seems that, instead of a single route that is coordinately regulated by Atg16l1 and A20, a complex mixture of signaling events involving NF-κB activation, induction of unconventional autophagy and (probably) protection from cell death are activated in single-deficient cells to compensate for the absence of the relevant partner. Unraveling exactly how these pathways become activated and interact with each other to deliver protective effects will require additional studies, but a few possible mechanistic hints are suggested by the literature.</p><p id="Par23">For example, the observed increased expression levels of Atg16l1 in A20-deficient conditions suggest that prolonged NF-κB activation may play a role in Atg16l1 stabilization to induce upregulation of autophagy, as a compensatory mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In this context, IKKα activation, in response to cytokine and microbial stimulation, was recently shown to phosphorylate Atg16l1 leading to its stabilization, thus preventing ER stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. A20 controls NOD2-induced NF-κB activation and induction of inflammatory signals through the deubiquitination of the adapter protein RIP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Although NOD2 can direct autophagy by recruiting Atg16l1 to the plasma membrane to impair bacterial entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, Atg16l1 was also shown to negatively regulate NOD2-dependent inflammatory responses independently of its canonical function in autophagy, by interfering with the ubiquitination and activation of RIP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This suggests that A20 might also be recruited to such complex and assist Atg16l1 in RIP2 deubiquitination, thus preventing chronic intestinal inflammation. However, these activities need further investigation.</p><p id="Par24">The WDD is absent in yeast Atg16l1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, suggesting that it mediates functions that are specific in multicellular organisms.

Recent evidence argues that the WDD acts as a docking site for upstream adapters able to engage the LC3-lipidation complex in unconventional compartments, thus promoting LC3-II synthesis through the N-terminal region that binds Atg5-Atg12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Whether all activities carried out by the WDD involve LC3 lipidation or if other mechanisms may be involved is still unclear. However, irrespective of the underlying mechanism, this region appears to mediate some of the apparently non-autophagic functions where Atg16l1 has been implicated, like certain innate cellular responses against bacterial infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, trafficking of secretory vesicles in Paneth cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> or the control of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Indeed, our results argue that the WDD does play a role in the regulation of the inflammatory response by interacting with relevant modulators of this pathway.</p><p id="Par25">The WDD has been shown to interact with ubiquitin to capture invading pathogens and recruit them to the autophagic machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In light of our results shown here, this process might be favored by A20, which also has ubiquitin binding activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. A20 could also collaborate with Atg16l1 through p62. It is known that p62 can interact with TRAF6, facilitating its oligomerization and ubiquitination to activate downstream NF-κB signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, implying that accumulation of p62 in A20 or Atg16l1-deficient conditions would enhance inflammatory stress. p62 also promotes caspase-8 aggregation leading to its full activation and apoptosis induction, a process which may be suppressed by A20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Together, these studies suggest that p62 aggregates serve as signaling hubs that determine whether cells will survive through TRAF6-NF-κB signaling, or die through caspase-8 aggregation inducing cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Both decisions might be regulated by A20.</p><p id="Par26">In summary, our data reveal a close functional relationship between A20 and ATG16L1 to preserve intestinal barrier integrity and prevent intestinal inflammation.

Precipitates were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer (0.2% detergent), resuspended in 2x RSB and boiled. Samples were resolved in 10% poly-acrylamide gels and silver stained. Specific bands absent in control (GST) samples were excised and processed for proteomics identification. Protein digestion was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> with minor variations. Silver-stained gel plugs were destained with a solution containing 7.5 mM potassium ferricyanide and 25 mM sodium thiosulfate, rinsed in water and dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile. Plugs were then DTT reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI; 6 ng/µl in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate) was added before incubation at 37 °C for 18 h. Tryptic peptides were dried in a speed vacuum system, desalted by using C18-homemade columns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> and analyzed by reversed-phased LC-MS/MS using a nanoAcquity UPLC (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) coupled to a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo-Fisher, San Jose, CA). Separations were done in a BEH 1.7 µm, 130 Å, 75 µm × 100 mm C18 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) at a 400-nL/min flow rate. Injected samples were trapped on a Symmetry, 5 µm particle size, 180 µm × 20 mm C18 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Peptides were eluted using a 30 min gradient from 3 to 35% B (0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile). The LTQ-Orbitrap Velos was operated in a data-dependent MS/MS mode using Xcalibur (Thermo-Fisher, San Jose, CA). Survey scans were acquired in the mass range 400–1600 m/z, with 30,000 resolution at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 400 and lock mass option enabled for the 445.120025 ion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. The 20 most intense peaks having ≥2 charge state and above 500 intensity threshold were selected in the ion trap for fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation. MASCOT [v 2.3] and Sequest HT [v 1.3] search algorithms were used for searching the acquired MS/MS spectra using Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer software (v. 1.4.1.14) against a database of human sequences (Uniprot, release 2013_05) with common contaminants. Search parameters were as follows: fully tryptic digestion with up to two missed cleavages, 10 ppm and 0.8 Da mass tolerances for precursor and product ions, respectively, oxidation of methionine was established as variable modification and carbamidomethylation of cysteine as fixed modification. 1% false discovery rate using Percolator was used for peptide validation. The crude lists of identified proteins (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">1</xref>) were manually curated to eliminate non-human references and redundant hits, and to find in all cases the equivalent reviewed Uniprot reference. We implemented a filtration step using the Crapome sever (<ext-link xlink:href="http://crapome.org/" ext-link-type="url">http://crapome.org/</ext-link>) to eliminate hits present in more than 10% of the control proteomics assays included in this database (thus likely to be artifacts). Such curation steps resulted in secondary lists of non-redundant and fully reviewed Uniprot entries annotated for function (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">2</xref>). The reviewed lists were subjected to a Venn analysis to find out the degree of redundancy of the identified proteins in the three experimental systems analyzed (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">3</xref>). Proteins were further classified according to their involvement in different functions/biological activities as annotated in any of the two Uniprot fields: Function [CC] and/or Gene Ontoloty (Biological process).
