However, the mechanisms for its action, and ultimately for resistance, have not been fully defined. Here, using a combination of expression profiling, genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of function and ORF/cDNA driven rescue screens, and cell-based models of spontaneous resistance, we identify bHLH/homeobox transcription factors and cell-cycle regulators as key genes mediating BETi’s response and resistance. Cells that acquire drug tolerance exhibit a more neuronally differentiated cell-state and expression of lineage-specific bHLH/homeobox transcription factors. However, they do not terminally differentiate, maintain expression of CCND2, and continue to cycle through S-phase. Moreover, CDK4/CDK6 inhibition delays acquisition of resistance. Therefore, our data provide insights about the mechanisms underlying BETi effects and the appearance of resistance and support the therapeutic use of combined cell-cycle inhibitors with BETi in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><p id="Par2">BET-bromodomain inhibitors could be used to treat medulloblastoma tumors with Myc amplifications.

In this way, we systematically evaluated which BETi target genes are both required for cellular proliferation, and able to rescue BETi phenotypes.

To test this, we interrogated the CTRP dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and found Tuj1 expression to be correlated with resistance to JQ1 across 783 cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14C</xref>).

These results suggest that the relevance of neuronal differentiation markers to BETi sensitivity are not restricted to D283 and D458 cells but generalize across cancer types that express these markers.</p><p id="Par40">We next sought to characterize the heterogeneity of stem cell and lineage markers within human medulloblastomas. We profiled Tuj1 expression, in addition to the stem markers Nestin, Olig2 and Sox2 across a panel of 46 medulloblastomas. There was heterogeneity in the proportion of Tuj1 expressing cells both within and across tumor samples (Supplementary Data File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM10">9</xref>). Across all tumors, medulloblastomas harbored a subpopulation of cells (median 9%, range 0–86%) that expressed Tuj1 but were negative for the stem cell markers, thus representing a more differentiated phenotype (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10c</xref>). In addition, we also observed subpopulations of cells that exhibited a mixed phenotype with co-expression of the neuronal marker TUJ1 with the stem markers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Tolerance to BETi is predetermined</title><p id="Par41">The heterogeneity within medulloblastomas led us to hypothesize that pre-existing subpopulations of differentiated neuronal cells may be selected for by BETi due to their inherent resistance. We explored this using two approaches. First, using flow cytometry, we observed an enrichment of Tuj1 positive and MSI1 negative drug-tolerant D458 cells with BETi. Flow cytometry analysis revealed 0.7% of cells to Tuj1 positive while negative for the stem marker MSI1 (thus representing a well-differentiated subpopulation) in untreated D458 cells. This population significantly expanded to 10% of drug-tolerant cells in JQ1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10d</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">Second, we leveraged barcoding technology to confirm that the changes in population structure observed in D458 cells reflected selection of subpopulations of cells that were predetermined to tolerate BETi. We used a lentivirally delivered library comprising 600,000 DNA barcodes to individually label both D283 and D458 cells and determine whether their progeny consistently survived treatment across eight replicate experiments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10e</xref>). Only 23 and 25% of all barcodes detected across all conditions were present after treatment with JQ1, in D283 and D458 cells respectively. Among these, 48 and 8% were present post-treatment across all replicates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14F</xref>).

Nuclei were stained in each cycle using Hoechst 33342 (Catalog No. 4082S, Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA). Images were taken using the INCell Analyzer 6000 Cell Imaging System (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) at 20× magnification using the DAPI, FITC, dsRed, and Cy5 channels. Exposure times ranged from 0.0750 to 1.000 ms. Fluorophores were inactivated by submerging slides in a 4.5% H2O2, 20 mM NaOH in PBS solution and exposed to LED light source for 2 h at room temperature.</p><p id="Par67">Images were processed and single-cell data was quantified using customized versions of ImageJ and MATLAB scripts from the Sorger Lab GitHub repository (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/sorgerlab/cycif" ext-link-type="url">https://github.com/sorgerlab/cycif</ext-link>). ImageJ was used to perform flat-field background subtraction, registration of images from each cycle, segmentation of single cells, and measurement of the average intensity value of each marker on a single cell basis. A cut off value for each marker was determined by visual inspection of the immunofluorescence image on ImageJ by a pathologist (S.C.). MATLAB was used to apply the cut off values, scoring cells with an average intensity value above the cut off as positive and cells with an average intensity value below the cut off as negative. All numeric analyses, including percentage of cells positive for one or more markers in each core of the TMA were performed in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Global chromatin profiling</title><p id="Par68">Quantitative targeted mass spectrometry was performed on sensitive and drug-tolerant D425 and D458 cells passaged in DMSO or BETi (JQ1 or IBET151) for 24 h.

Raw sequencing data was mapped to the reference genome using bowtie2 version 2.2.1 with parameters -p 4 -k 1. Peaks were called using MACS version 1.4.2 over an input control. Reads were extended 200-bp and normalized to read-density in units of reads per million mapped reads per bp (rpm/bp). To calculate ChIP-binding score for each gene, read-density in units for reads per million were aggregated for each gene (extending to 500 kb in each direction). <italic>Z</italic>-scores of ChIP-seq scores for each gene within each sample was calculated.
